==Life and career==
Breillat was born in [[Bressuire]], [[Deux-Sèvres]], but grew up in [[Niort]]. She decided to become a writer and director at the age of twelve after watching [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Gycklarnas afton]]'', believing she had found her "fictional body" in [[Harriet Andersson]]'s character, Anna.<ref name=cinefils>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpH-V6kkOwI |title=CATHERINE BREILLAT on INTIMACY - cine-fils.com |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>

She started her career after studying acting at Yves Furet's "Studio d'Entraînement de l'Acteur" in Paris together with her sister, actress [[Marie-Hélène Breillat]] (born 2 June 1947) in 1967. At the age of 17, she had her novel published,'' l'Homme facile'' (''Easy Man''). The French government banned it for readers under 18 years old. A film based on the novel was made shortly after the publication of the book, but the producer went bankrupt and the distributor [[Artedis]] blocked any commercial release of the film for twenty years although it had been given an R rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/culture/0101278980-breillat-veut-racheter-son-film-pierre-richard-muller-d-artedis-en-possede-les-droits-une-vraie-jeune-fille-1976-de-catherine-breillat-avec-charlotte-alexandra-hiram-keller-bruno-balp-rita-meiden-geor |title=Breillat veut racheter son film.

Breillat is known for films focusing on sexuality,<ref>Emma Wilson, "Deforming femininity: Catherine Breillat's <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Romance</span>" ''France on Film: Reflections on Popular French Cinema'' ed. Lucy Mazdon. London: Wallflower (2001): 146. ''Romance'' "is part of a larger and sustained project in Breillat's art to consider, challenge and reinvent female sexuality."</ref> intimacy, gender conflict, and [[sibling rivalry]]. Breillat has been the subject of controversy for her explicit depictions of [[Sexual violence|sexuality and violence]]. She cast the [[pornstar]] [[Rocco Siffredi]] in her films ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'' (''Romance X'', 1999) and ''Anatomie de l’enfer'' (''[[Anatomy of Hell]]'', 2004). Her novels have been best-sellers.

Her work has been associated with the [[New French Extremity|cinéma du corps/cinema of the body]] genre.<ref name=jq>Palmer, Tim, ''Brutal Intimacy: Analyzing Contemporary French Cinema'', Wesleyan University Press, 2011.</ref> In an interview with ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'', she described [[David Cronenberg]] as another filmmaker she considers to have a similar approach to sexuality in film.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Though Breillat spends most of her time behind the camera, she has acted in a handful of movies. She made her film debut in [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' (1972) as Mouchette, a dressmaker, alongside her sister Marie-Hélène Breillat.

In 2004, Breillat suffered a [[cerebral hemorrhage]], causing a [[stroke]] that paralyzed her left side.<ref name="Parisien 2009, p. 13">"Quand Christophe Rocancourt et Catherine Breillat se dechirent" Le Parisien; Thursday July 9, 2009, p. 13</ref> After five months of hospitalization and a slow rehabilitation, she gradually returned to work, producing ''Une vieille maîtresse'' (''[[The Last Mistress]]'') in 2007.  This film was one of three French films officially selected for the [[Cannes Film Festival]] of that year.

In 2007, Breillat met notorious [[confidence trick#Terminology|conman]] [[Christophe Rocancourt]], and offered him a leading role in a movie that she was planning to make, based on her own novel ''Bad Love'', and starring [[Naomi Campbell]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Secher|first=Benjamin|title=Catherine Breillat: 'All true artists are hated'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3672302/Catherine-BreillatAll-true-artists-are-hated.html|accessdate=15 January 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=5 April 2008}}</ref>  Soon after, she gave him [[Euro|€]]25,000 to write a screenplay titled ''La vie amoureuse de Christophe Rocancourt'' (''The Love Life of Christophe Rocancourt''), and over the next year and a half, would give him loans totalling an additional €678,000.<ref name=Figaro>{{cite news|last=de Mallevoüe|first=Delphine|title=Christophe Raconcourt sort de prison et prépare un livre|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2012/02/17/01016-20120217ARTFIG00667-huit-mois-de-prison-ferme-pour-rocancourt.php|accessdate=15 January 2013|newspaper=[[Le Figaro]]|date=18 February 2012|language=French}}</ref> In 2009, a book written by Breillat was published, in which she alleged that Rocancourt had taken advantage of her diminished mental capacity, as she was still recovering from her stroke.<ref>{{cite web|last=Groves|first=Don|title=Breillat's new twist on Sleeping Beauty|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/films/blog-articles/120022/breillat-s-new-twist-on-sleeping-beauty|work=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]|accessdate=15 January 2013|date=9 August 2010}}</ref> The book is titled ''Abus de faiblesse'', a French legal term usually translated as "abuse of weakness".<ref>{{cite web|last=Roxo|first=Alexandra|title=A Conversation with Catherine Breillat (THE SLEEPING BEAUTY)|url=http://www.hammertonail.com/interviews/a-conversation-with-catherine-breillat-the-sleeping-beauty/|work=Hammer to Nail|accessdate=15 January 2013|date=7 July 2011}}</ref> In 2012, Rocancourt was convicted of ''abus de faiblesse'' for taking Breillat's money, and sentenced to prison.<ref name=Figaro />

In September 2010, Breillat's second fairy-tale based film, ''La belle endormie'' (''Sleeping Beauty''), opened in the Orizzonti sidebar in the 67th [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref name=ejlyman>Lyman, Eric J., "'La Belle endormie' to premiere at Venice fest", "The Hollywood Reporter", 19 July 2010 [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/world/news/e3ied526ffc296810ce8b90979fc1796c33] Access date: Thursday August 19, 2010.</ref>

{{As of|2011}}, although Breillat had moved on to other projects, she still hoped to film ''Bad Love'', but had not yet been able to find financing to do so.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|title='Sleeping Beauty' Director Catherine Breillat: 'To Be An Artist is To Be Alone.'|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_sleeping_beauty_director_catherine_breillat_to_be_an_artist_is_to|work=[[IndieWire|Indiewire]]|publisher=SnagFilms|accessdate=15 January 2013|date=6 July 2011}}</ref> However somewhat ironically, a film adaptation of her book ''Abus de faiblesse'', directed by Breillat and starring [[Isabelle Huppert]], began production in 2012, and was screened at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Keslassy|first=Elsa|title=Breillat to helm 'Abus de faiblesse'|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118048516/|accessdate=15 January 2013|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=12 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kolesnikov-Jessop|first=Sonia|title=Isabelle Huppert Hopes to Work With More Asian Film Directors|url=http://encn.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/847645/isabelle-huppert-hopes-to-work-with-more-asian-film-directors|work=[[Louise Blouin Media|ARTINFO]]|publisher=Louise Blouin Media|accessdate=15 January 2013|date=12 December 2012}}</ref>
