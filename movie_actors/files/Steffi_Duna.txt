'''Steffi Duna''' (8 February 1910 – 22 April 1992) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born film actress. 

==Hungarian Dancer==
Born '''Stephanie Berindey''' in [[Budapest]] of Czech extraction, Duna started dancing at the age of nine and first attracted attention as a thirteen-year-old [[ballet]] dancer in [[Europe]]. Duna made her first stage appearance performing dramatized [[fairy tales]] at the Children's Theater of Budapest. Initially opposed to the idea, her father sent her to the best schools in the Hungarian capitol to learn dancing and soon she had danced in most of the capitals of Europe.
In 1932, she appeared on the London stage in the Revue [[Words and Music (musical)|Words and Music]] by [[Noël Coward]], being one of the four actresses to create the song [[Mad about the Boy]].

==Movie Actress==
When she first came to [[Hollywood]] in 1932, Duna could not speak a word of English. She made up her mind to learn quickly. Directors advised her to stay away from her Hungarian friends to speed up her learning of English. Within a few years she could speak six different languages. During the 1930s Duna played a variety of nationalities. However, despite her European background, she was often cast as fiery Latin femme fatales in films that made full use of her exotic and glamorous persona, such as ''[[La Cucaracha (1934 film)|La Cucaracha]]'' (1934) the first live-action short film made in three-strip [[Technicolor]]. 

She made her film debut in ''The Indiscretions of Eve'' (1932) in the starring role (along with [[Jessica Tandy]] also making her debut). Signed by [[RKO Radio Pictures]],
Duna played ''Guninana'', the [[Eskimo]] wife of [[Francis Lederer]], in ''Man of Two Worlds'' (1934). 

Lederer had performed with Duna in the [[Berlin, Germany]] presentation of ''Die Wunderbar''. In 1936, she played the part of Nedda in the British film version of 'Pagliacci', starring [[Richard Tauber]]. Films in which she played lead roles such as ''[[Panama Lady]]'' (1939) with [[Lucille Ball]], were popular but did not make her a major star. Her best remembered films include ''[[Anthony Adverse]]'' (1936) and ''[[Waterloo Bridge (1940 film)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1940).

==Marriages==
Duna was married first to the actor [[John Carroll (actor)|John Carroll]]; the marriage produced one child, a daughter. They divorced in 1938. In 1940 she married actor [[Dennis O'Keefe]]; they remained together until his death. 

==Death==
Duna retired from films in 1940, and died in [[Beverly Hills, California]] in 1992, aged 82.
