Diesel made his stage debut at age seven when he appeared in the children's play ''Dinosaur Door'', written by [[Barbara Garson]]. The play was produced at [[Theater for the New City]] in New York's [[Greenwich Village]]. His involvement in the play came about when he, his brother, and some friends had broken into the [[Theater for the New City]]'s space on Jane Street with the intent to vandalize it. They were confronted by the theater's artistic director, Crystal Field, who offered them roles in the upcoming show instead of calling the police.<ref>Krulik, Nancy E. Vin Diesel: Fueled for Success.

==Career==
===1990s===
[[File:VinDieselMarch09.jpg|thumb|left|Diesel at a premiere for ''[[Fast & Furious]]'' in 2009]]
Diesel's first film role was a brief uncredited appearance in ''[[Awakenings]]'' (1990). He then wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the short film ''[[Multi-Facial]]'' (1994), a short semi-autobiographical film which follows a struggling actor stuck in the audition process. The film was selected for screening at the 1995 [[Cannes Festival]]. He made his first feature-length film, ''[[Strays (film)|Strays]]'' (1997), an urban drama in which he played a gang leader whose love for a woman inspires him to try to change his ways. Written, directed, and produced by Diesel, the film was selected for competition at the 1997 [[Sundance Festival]], leading to an MTV deal to turn it into a series. He was then cast in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1998 Oscar-winning film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' on the poignancy of his performance in ''Multi-Facial''. In 1999, he provided the voice of the [[title character]] in the animated film ''[[The Iron Giant]]''.

===2000s===
[[File:Fast Five Cast 2.jpg|thumb|200px|''Fast Five'' cast with [[Natalie Morales]] for [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]''.]]
Diesel had a major role in the drama thriller ''[[Boiler Room (film)|Boiler Room]]'' (2000) appearing alongside [[Giovanni Ribisi]] and [[Ben Affleck]]. He got his breakthrough leading role{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} as the [[anti-hero]] [[Riddick]] in the science-fiction film ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'' later that year. Diesel attained [[action hero]] stardom with two box office hits: the [[street racing]] action film ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' (2001), and the action thriller ''[[XXX (2002 film)|xXx]]'' (2002). In 2004, Diesel reprised his role as Riddick in ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]'', which was a box office failure considering the large budget. He also voiced the character in two spin-off video games. In 2005, he played a lighthearted role in the comedy film ''[[The Pacifier]]'', which became a box office success.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 2006, he chose a dramatic role playing real-life mobster [[Jack DiNorscio]] in ''[[Find Me Guilty]]''. Although he received critical acclaim for his performance, the film did poorly at the box office.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Later that year, Diesel made a cameo appearance in ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'', reprising his role from ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]''.

In 2007, Diesel was set to produce and star as [[Agent 47]] in the [[Hitman (2007 film)|film adaptation]] of the video game ''[[Hitman (video game)|Hitman]]'', but eventually pulled back and served as executive producer on the film instead. In 2008, he starred in the science-fiction action thriller ''[[Babylon A.D.]]''. Diesel returned to the ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'' series, alongside all the actors from the original film, in ''[[Fast & Furious]]'', which was released in April 2009.

===2010s===
Diesel reprised his role as Dominic Toretto in the fifth and sixth  ''Furious'' franchise, ''[[Fast Five]]'' (2011) and ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'' (2013). He reprised his role as Riddick in the third film of the Riddick series, simply titled ''[[Riddick (film)|Riddick]]'' (2013). In August 2013, Diesel received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref name="WalkofFame">{{cite web|first=Julie |last=Moult |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2402384/Vin-Diesels-girlfriend-children-cheer-actor-receives-Hollywood-Walk-Fame-accolade.html |title=Vin Diesel's girlfriend and two children cheer on the actor as he receives his Hollywood Walk of Fame accolade |publisher=[[Daily Mail and General Trust]] |work=[[Daily Mail]] |date=August 27, 2013 |accessdate=November 30, 2013}}</ref> He voiced [[Groot]] in the 2014 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''<ref>{{cite news | title=He is Groot: Diesel to star in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' | last=Truitt | first=Brian | work=[[USA Today]] | date=21 December 2013 | url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/12/21/vin-diesel-guardians-of-the-galaxy-movie/4162507/ }}</ref> and starred in the 2015 sequel ''[[Furious 7]]''.<ref name="Sequel4">{{cite web|first= |last= |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/04/fast-and-furious-7-release-date-july-11-2014-universal/ |title='Fast And Furious 7′ Gets July 11, 2014 Release Date |publisher=Deadline.com (PMC) |date=April 16, 2013 |accessdate=April 16, 2013 | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/6FvhFdCjG | archivedate = July 5, 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref> Diesel is also scheduled to star in ''[[The Last Witch Hunter]]''<ref name=Kojak>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title=‘xXx 3′ Is Definitely Happening, Will Shoot in Asia, Says Vin Diesel|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/vin-diesel-xxx-3/|website=/film|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref> as well as an updated version of ''[[Kojak]]''.<ref name=Kojak/> In addition, Diesel is stated to return to the starring role in a third ''xXx'' movie.<ref name=Kojak/>
