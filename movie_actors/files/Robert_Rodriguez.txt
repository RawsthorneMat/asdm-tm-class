==Early life==
Rodríguez was born in [[San Antonio, Texas]], the son of [[Mexican-American]] parents Elizabeth (née Villegas), a nurse, and Cecilio G. Rodríguez, a salesman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/37/Robert-Rodriguez.html |title=Robert Rodriguez Biography (1968?-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=April 24, 2009}}</ref><ref name=ena>{{cite book|last=Marvis|first=Barbara J.|authorlink=|title=Robert Rodriguez|publisher=Mitchell Lane|year=1998|location=|pages=5|url=|isbn=1883845483}}</ref> He began his interest in film at age 11 when his father bought one of the first [[VCR]]s, which came with a camera.<ref>[http://www.fridaymoviez.com/celebrity/biography/robert-rodriguez"Robert Rodriguez Biography"] Friday Moviez Entertainment Guaranteed</ref>

While attending [[St. Anthony Catholic High School (San Antonio, Texas)|St. Anthony High School]] in San Antonio, he was commissioned to videotape the school's football games. According to his sister he was fired soon afterward for shooting them with a cinematic style, getting shots of parents' reactions and the ball traveling through the air instead of shooting the whole play. There he met Carlos Gallardo; they both shot films on video throughout high school and college. After graduating Rodriguez went to the [[University of Texas at Austin College of Communication|College of Communication]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he also developed a love of cartooning. His grades were not high enough to get into the school's film program, so he invented a daily comic strip entitled ''Los Hooligans'' with many of the characters based on his siblings – in particular, one of his sisters, Maricarmen. The comic proved to be quite successful, running for three years in the student newspaper ''[[The Daily Texan]]'', while Rodríguez continued to make short films.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Rodríguez grew up shooting action and horror short films on video, and editing on two VCRs. Finally, in the fall of 1990, his entry in a local film contest earned him a spot in the university's film program where he made the award-winning 16&nbsp;mm short ''[[Bedhead (short film)|Bedhead]]'' (1991). The film chronicles the amusing misadventures of a young girl whose older brother sports an incredibly tangled mess of hair that she cannot tolerate. Even at this early stage, Rodríguez's trademark style began to emerge: quick cuts, intense zooms, and fast camera movements deployed with a sense of humor that offsets the action.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Career==

=== Early career ===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2014}}
The short film "Bedhead" attracted enough attention to encourage him to seriously attempt a career as a filmmaker. He went on to shoot the action flick ''[[El Mariachi]]'' in Spanish. ''El Mariachi'', which was shot for around $7,000 with money raised by his friend Carlos Gallardo and participating in medical research studies, won the Audience Award at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1993. The film, originally intended for the Spanish-language low-budget home-video market, was "cleaned up" with post-production work costing several hundred thousand dollars before being distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]] in the United States, still being promoted as "the movie made for $7,000". Rodríguez described his experiences making the film in his book ''[[Rebel Without a Crew]]''.

Bedhead 1991 – was recognized for excellence in the Black Maria Film Festival, and was selected by Film/Video Curator Sally Berger, for the Black Maria 20th anniversary retrospective at [[MoMA]] in 2006.

=== Mainstream success ===
''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'', was a sequel to ''El Mariachi'' that starred [[Antonio Banderas]] and introduced [[Salma Hayek]] to American audiences.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Rodríguez went on to collaborate with [[Quentin Tarantino]] on the [[vampire]] thriller ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (also both co-producing its [[From Dusk till Dawn (film series)|two sequels]]), and he is currently writing,{{when|date=November 2014}} directing, and producing the [[From Dusk till Dawn: The Series|TV series]] for his own cable network, [[El Rey (TV network)|El Rey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/el-reys-from-dusk-till-dawn-rounds-out-cast/|title=El Rey's 'From Dusk Till Dawn' Rounds Out Cast|author=The Deadline Team|work=Deadline|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}</ref> Rodriguez has also worked with [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]], on the horror film ''[[The Faculty]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 2001, Rodríguez enjoyed his first Hollywood hit with ''[[Spy Kids]]'', which went on to become a movie franchise. A third "mariachi" film also appeared in late 2003, ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'', which completed the [[Mexico Trilogy]] (also called the Mariachi Trilogy). He operates a production company called [[Troublemaker Studios]], formerly Los Hooligans Productions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Rodríguez co-directed ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' (2005), an adaptation of the [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] ''[[Sin City]]'' comic books; [[Quentin Tarantino]] guest-directed a scene. During production in 2004, Rodríguez insisted that Miller would be credited as co-director, because he considered the visual style of Miller's comic art to be just as important as his own in the film. However, the [[Directors Guild of America]] would not allow it, citing that only "legitimate teams" could share the director's credit (e.g. the [[Wachowski Brothers]]). Rodríguez chose to resign from the DGA, stating, "It was easier for me to quietly resign before shooting because otherwise I'd be forced to make compromises I was unwilling to make or set a precedent that might hurt the guild later on." By resigning from the DGA, Rodríguez was forced to relinquish his director's seat on the film ''[[John Carter of Mars (film)|John Carter of Mars]]'' for [[Paramount Pictures]]. Rodríguez had already signed on and had been announced as director of that film, planning to begin filming soon after completing ''Sin City''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

''Sin City'' was a critical hit in 2005 as well as a box office success, particularly for a hyperviolent comic book adaptation that did not have name recognition comparable to the ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' or ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''. He has stated that he is interested in eventually adapting all of Miller's ''Sin City'' comic books.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Rodríguez released ''[[The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D]]'' in 2005, a superhero-kid movie intended for the same younger audiences as his ''Spy Kids'' series. ''Sharkboy and Lavagirl'' was based on a story conceived by Rodríguez's 7-year-old son, Racer, who was given credit for the screenplay. The film was not a major success, grossing just $39&nbsp;million at the box office.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Rodríguez wrote and directed the film ''[[Planet Terror]]'' as part of the double-bill release ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007). Quentin Tarantino directed ''Grindhouse'''s other film.

He also has a series of "Ten Minute Film School" segments on several of his DVD releases, showing aspiring filmmakers how to make good, profitable movies using inexpensive tactics. Starting with the ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' DVD, Rodríguez began creating a series called, "Ten Minute Cooking School" where he revealed his recipe for "Puerco Pibil" (based on [[Cochinita pibil]], an old dish from [[Yucatán]]), the same food [[Johnny Depp]]'s character, "Agent Sands" ate in the film. The popularity of this series led to the inclusion of another "Cooking School" on the two-disc version of the ''[[Sin City]]'' DVD where Rodríguez teaches the viewer how to make "Sin City Breakfast Tacos", a dish (made for his cast and crew during late-night shoots and editing sessions) utilizing his grandmother's tortilla recipe and different egg mixes for the filling. He had initially planned to release a third "Cooking School" with the DVD release of ''[[Planet Terror]]'' but then announced on the "Film School" segment of the DVD that he would put it on the ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' DVD set instead. The Cooking School, titled "Texas Barbecue...from the GRAVE!", is a dish based on the "secret barbecue recipe" of JT Hague, [[Jeff Fahey]]'s character in the film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/04/03/grindhouse-dvd-details-revealed|title=Grindhouse DVD Details Revealed|publisher=/Film}}</ref>

Rodríguez is a strong supporter of [[digital cinematography|digital filmmaking]], having been introduced to the practice by director [[George Lucas]], who personally invited Rodríguez to use the digital cameras at Lucas' headquarters.<ref>''Once Upon a Time in Mexico'' DVD feature "Film is Dead".</ref>

Rodríguez was presented with the Extraordinary Contribution to Filmmaking Award at the 2010 [[Austin Film Festival]].

===''Predators''===
[[File:Robert Rodriguez.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Rodríguez at the premiere of ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', Austin, Texas, 2007]]
{{Main|Predators (film)}}
On April 23, 2009, it was announced that Rodríguez would produce a new [[Predator (film)|Predator]] sequel, entitled ''[[Predators (film)|Predators]]''. This film's script was based on early drafts he had written after seeing the original. Rodriguez's ideas included a planet-sized game preserve and various creatures used by the Predators to hunt a group of abducted yet skilled humans. Opening to mixed reviews, the film fared reasonably well at the box office.

===''Machete''===
{{Main|Machete (film)}}

''Machete'' is a feature film directed by Rodríguez and released in September 2010. It is an expansion of a fake [[trailer (film)|trailer]] Rodriguez directed for the 2007 film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''. It starred [[Danny Trejo]] as the title character. Trejo, Rodriguez' 2nd cousin, has worked with him in some of his other movies such as ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'', ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' and ''[[Spy Kids]]'', where Trejo's character was also known as Machete. Although originally announced to be released direct-to-DVD as an extra on the ''[[Planet Terror]]'' DVD, the film was produced as a theatrical release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070514_machete_movie_greenlit.html |title=Machete movie greenlit! |accessdate=November 17, 2007 |last=Morris |first=Clint |date=May 14, 2007 |work= |publisher=Moviehole |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011040812/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070514_machete_movie_greenlit.html |archivedate = October 11, 2007}}</ref>

According to Rodríguez, the origins of the film go back to ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]''. He says, "When I met Danny, I said, 'This guy should be like the Mexican [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] or [[Charles Bronson]], putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete.' So I decided to do that way back when, never got around to it until finally now. So now, of course, I want to keep going and do a feature."<ref>{{cite news |last=Moro |first=Eric |title=SXSW 07: Machete Movie Coming |work= |pages= |language= |publisher=IGN Film Force |date=March 11, 2007 |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/772/772081p1.html | accessdate=March 27, 2007}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo in ''Desperado''. "So I wrote him this idea of a [[federales|federale]] from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes [[FBI]] or [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, "That's ''Machete''. He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts." But I never got around to making it."<ref>{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Gavin |title=Horror Film Directors Dish About ''Grindhouse'' Trailers |work= |pages= |language= |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=April 2007 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/14022408/online_exclusive_horror_film_directors_dish_about_grindhouse_trailers/1 |accessdate=April 4, 2007}}</ref>

Rodríguez hoped to film ''Machete'' at the same time as ''[[Sin City 2]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |title=Rodriguez to film Machete Movie during Sin City 2|work= |pages= |language= |publisher=/film |date=March 26, 2007 |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/26/rodriguez-to-film-machete-movie-during-sin-city-2 |accessdate=May 9, 2008}}</ref> Additionally, during [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con International 2008]], he took the time to speak about Machete, including such topics as: status, possible sequels after the release of Machete, and production priorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrS5XRfeLtU |title=COMIC CON 2008: Robert Rodriguez talks Machete |publisher=YouTube |date=July 24, 2008 |accessdate=April 24, 2009}}</ref> It was also revealed that he has regularly pulled sequences from it for his other productions including [[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]. ''Machete'' was released in theaters September 3, 2010 in the U.S.A.

On May 5, 2010, Robert Rodríguez responded to Arizona's controversial immigration law by releasing an "illegal" trailer on Ain't It Cool News.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/media/machete-movie-trailer-smart-slash-arizona-immigration-law/19469060/ |title=Machete Movie Trailer Takes a Smart Slash at Arizona Immigration Law |publisher=dailyfinance.com |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2010}}</ref> The fake trailer combined elements of the ''Machete'' trailer that appeared in ''Grindhouse'' with footage from the actual film,<ref name="AICN"/> and implied that the film would be about Machete leading a revolt against anti-immigration politicians and border vigilantes.<ref name="AICN"/> Several movie websites, including [[Internet Movie Database]], reported that it was the official teaser for the film.<ref name="AICN"/> However, Rodriguez later revealed the trailer to be a joke, explaining "it was [[Cinco de Mayo]] and I had too much [[tequila]]."<ref name="AICN">{{cite web |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/45169 |title=A family friendly ''Machete''?

=== Unproduced projects and upcoming films ===
Since 1998, he has owned the film rights to [[Mike Allred]]'s off-beat comic ''[[Madman (Image Comics)|Madman]]''. The two have hinted at the project being close to beginning on several occasions without anything coming of it. However, other projects have been completed first (Allred was instrumental in connecting Rodríguez with Frank Miller, leading to the production of ''Sin City''). In 2004, Allred, while promoting his comic book, ''[[The Golden Plates]]'', announced that a screenplay by [[George Huang (director)|George Huang]] was near completion. In March 2006, it was announced that production on ''Sin City 2'' would be postponed. Allred announced at the 2006 [[WonderCon]] that production would likely commence on ''[[Madman (Image Comics)#Film adaptation|Madman the Movie]]'' in 2006. Huang is actually friends with Rodriguez, who advised him to pursue filmmaking as a career when Rodriguez landed a deal with [[Columbia Pictures]] where Huang was an employee.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In May 2007 it was announced that Rodríguez had signed on to direct a remake of ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' for a 2008 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i3e0cd5c8b61cf5dd1910e92c972e7e99?imw=Y |title=Rodriguez to direct 'Barbarella' |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=May 22, 2007 |accessdate=April 24, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> At the 2007 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] convention, actress [[Rosario Dawson]] announced that because of ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'', production of ''Sin City 2'' would be put on hold.

As of May 2009, Rodríguez plans to produce a live-action remake of ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'', a 1983 film collaboration between painter [[Frank Frazetta]] and animator [[Ralph Bakshi]]. The deal was closed shortly after Frazetta's death.<ref name="AICN"/>

In 2011, Rodríguez announced at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] that he had purchased the film rights to ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' and planned to develop a [[Heavy Metal (film)#Remake|new animated film]] at the new Quick Draw Studios.<ref>{{cite web | title = SDCC: Robert Rodriguez Takes Heavy Metal | author = Film School Rejects | url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=80106 | publisher = comingsoon.net | date = July 21, 2011 | accessdate = November 26, 2011}}</ref>

==The "one-man film crew" and "Mariachi-style"==
Rodríguez not only has the credits of producing, directing and writing his films, he also frequently serves as [[Film editing#Film editor|editor]], [[director of photography]], [[camera operator]], [[steadicam]] operator, composer, [[production designer]], visual effects supervisor, and [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] on his films. This has earned him the nickname of "the one-man film crew". He abbreviates his numerous roles in his film credits; ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'', for instance, is "shot, chopped, and scored by Robert Rodriguez", and ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' is "shot and cut by Robert Rodriguez".

He calls his style of making movies "Mariachi-style" (in reference to his first feature film ''El Mariachi'') in which (according to the back cover of his book ''[[Rebel Without a Crew]]'')
"Creativity, not money, is used to solve problems." [[Stu Maschwitz]] coined the term "Robert Rodriguez list", i.e. you make a list of things you have access to like cool cars, apartments, horses, samurai swords and so on, and then write the screenplay based on that list.<ref>''The DV Rebel's Guide: An All-Digital Approach to Making Killer Action Movies on the Cheap'', [[Stu Maschwitz]] (2007).</ref>
