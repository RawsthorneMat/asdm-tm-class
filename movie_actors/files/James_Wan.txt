Wan has also directed ''[[Dead Silence]]'' and ''[[Death Sentence (2007 film)|Death Sentence]]'' (both 2007), ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'' (2010), ''[[The Conjuring]]'' and ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2]]'' (both 2013), and ''[[Furious 7]]'', which was released in April 2015.

==Director==

===2000–2006: ''Stygian'', ''Saw'' to ''Saw III''===
{{Main|Saw (franchise)}}
Before his success in the mainstream film industry, he made his first feature-length film, ''Stygian'', with Shannon Young, which won "Best Guerrilla Film" at the [[Melbourne Underground Film Festival|Melbourne Underground Film Festival (MUFF)]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shannon Young|url=http://www.innersense.com.au/mif/young.html|work=Melbourne Independent Filmmakers|publisher=Bill Mousoulis|accessdate=1 August 2012|author=Shannon Young|date=April 2005}}</ref>

Since creating the franchise, Wan and [[Leigh Whannell]] have served as [[executive producer]]s to the sequels ''[[Saw II]]'', ''[[Saw III]]'', ''[[Saw IV]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title='Saw’ Co-creator/Director Takes on 'The Further’!|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18792|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=BLOODY DISGUSTING LLC|accessdate=15 September 2012|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=21 January 2010}}</ref>  ''[[Saw V]]'', ''[[Saw VI]]'' and ''[[Saw 3D|Saw 3D: The Final Chapter]]''.

The release of ''Saw 3D'', complete with its subtitle, was to signify the completion of the franchise; however, Costas Mandylor, an actor in the seventh instalment, revealed that multiple endings to the film had been shot and the series could continue depending on which was used. The sixth sequel continued the profit margin performance of the original film and earned USD136 million in the global market, based on a production budget of USD20 million, while all films in the series have grossed over USD100 million in the American market. In August, 2012, various online horror publications stated that a source at Lionsgate, the franchise's production company, had revealed intentions for an eighth ''Saw'' sequel, but it was at a "tinkering" stage at the time of the disclosure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lionsgate To Bring Back 'Saw’ Franchise|url=http://screenrant.com/saw-8-3d-lionsgate-rob-142702/|work=Screenrant|publisher=Screen Rant, LLC: TV, movie news and reviews|accessdate=14 December 2012|author=Rob Keyes|date=December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lionsgate Considering A 'Saw’ Franchise Reboot|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/lionsgate-considering-a-saw-franchise-reboot/67887/|work=Prefix mag|publisher=Prefix|accessdate=14 December 2012|author=Justin Channell|date=12 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Forget 'Twilight,’ Lionsgate Tinkering With Remaking 'Saw’ Franchise…|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3157836/forget-twilight-lionsgate-tinkering-with-remaking-saw-franchise/|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=Bloody Disgusting, LLC|accessdate=14 December 2012|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=7 August 2012}}</ref>

===2007–2009: ''Dead Silence'', ''Death Sentence''===
In 2007, Wan directed two feature films. The first of which was the horror film ''Dead Silence'', a film that was the result of advice from Wan and Whannell's agent at the time; Whannell has since stated that the film was a negative experience for him:

<blockquote>
It all started when James and I returned from the Sundance Film Festival, where we had screened 'Saw' to much success. Our 'representatives' promptly told us that we should get another deal for a film stitched up before it was released. It was presented as a kind of insurance - if 'Saw' was a flop, we had another film to fall back on. Seems logical. There was only one problem - I didn't have any ideas for a new film. I had barely been able to catch my breath throughout the whole 'Saw' experience, let alone dream up another film idea. Instead of telling our representatives that they had to wait until I came up with an idea I really liked though, I locked myself in the bedroom of the crappy apartment we had rented in Hollywood and tried to force an idea out like a particularly stubborn hangover shit. It was creativity at gunpoint. If I could go back in time, I would politely tell everyone to go fuck themselves, but back then....no. I paced and paced and even took up smoking for a while, so stressed out was I.<ref name="Word">{{cite web|title=Dud Silence: The Hellish Experience Of Making A Bad Horror Film|url=http://thewordinthestone.com/#!111|work=The Word in the Stone|publisher=Leigh Whannell|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=Leigh Whannell|date=31 August 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

''Dead Silence'' featured Australian actor [[Ryan Kwanten]] (''True Blood'' television series), and is based on the premise of a legend, whereby the ghost of a ventriloquist, Mary Shaw, removes the tongue of any person who screams in its presence. Rather than a gore movie, Wan described the film as "a creepy doll movie. It's in the spirit of those old ''Twilight Zone'' episodes or Hammer Horror Films. Very old-school."<ref name="Icon">{{cite web|title=James Wan Interview|url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_JamesWan.htm|work=Icons of Fright|publisher=Icons of Fright.com|accessdate=13 December 2012|author=Robg|coauthors=Adam Barnick & Bunni Speigelman|date=June 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dead Silence - Interview with Ryan Kwanten: Ryan Kwanten On The Curse Of Mary Shaw|url=http://www.reelz.com/trailer-clips/18416/dead-silence-interview-with-ryan-kwanten/|work=REELZ – TV About Movies|publisher=Reelz|accessdate=13 December 2012|format=Video upload|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MARY SHAW AND JAMES WAN FROM DEAD SILENCE, INSIDIOUS, SAW|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25pz7lrf8xA|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=13 December 2012|author=TheHalloweenTown|format=Video upload|date=29 October 2012}}</ref>

[[File:James Wan.JPG|thumb|right|Wan at [[Comic-Con 2007]]]]
Wan's second directorial film of 2007 was ''Death Sentence'', a film adapted from the Brian Garfield novel of the same name that was written as the sequel to ''Death Wish''.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Wan|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1808579791|work=Yahoo!

Whannell features as a minor character in the film, playing one of the gang members who is eventually killed by Bacon's character.<ref>{{cite news|title=In 'Death Sentence,' No Method to Dad's Madness|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/30/AR2007083002048.html|accessdate=14 December 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=31 August 2007|author=Desson Thomson|agency=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fanpop > Movies > James Wan and... > Images > Photos > On set of Death Sentence|url=http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/james-wan-and-leigh-whannell/images/930609/title/on-set-death-sentence-photo|work=fanpop – what are you a fan of?|publisher=Fanpop, Inc|accessdate=14 December 2012|author=DarkAngelKris|format=Photo upload|year=2008}}</ref> Wan described the film as "a raw and gritty, 70s styled revenge thriller ... It's my arthouse movie with guns."<ref name="Icon" />

Having worked on his previous three films continuously, Wan told CraveOnline that he was ready for "a bit of time off just to chill... but at the same time I'm using this opportunity to write again" following the completion of ''Death Sentence''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive: James Wan's Death Sentence|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=36597|work=ComingSoon.net|publisher=Evolve Media Corp|accessdate=15 September 2012|author=Edward Douglas|date=27 August 2007}}</ref>

===2010–2013: ''Insidious'', ''The Conjuring'', ''Insidious: Chapter 2''===
Next, Wan directed the horror film ''Insidious'', which premiered at the 2010 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] as part of the "Midnight Madness" programme and was sold to Sony Pictures Worldwide for a seven-figure sum within four hours of the premiere's conclusion. The film began its American theatrical release in the first weekend of April 2011 and achieved third place at the box office, with an estimated USD13.5 million in ticket sales.<ref name="Click">{{cite web|title=James Wan & Leigh Whannell INSIDIOUS Interview; The SAW Creators Also Discuss Their Untitled Sci-Fi Project, NIGHTFALL, and Recent Horror Remakes|url=http://collider.com/james-wan-leigh-whannell-interview-insidious/83806/|work=Collider|publisher=IndieClick Film Network|accessdate=14 December 2012|author=Ron Messer|date=4 April 2011}}</ref>

Starring [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Rose Byrne]] and [[Barbara Hershey]], the film was made independently, as Wan sought complete creative control and also wanted to make a film that was markedly different from the gore that he had become synonymous with due to ''Saw''. Wan stated in an interview, "the fact that ''Insidious'' was not being run by a committee really afforded me the luxury to make a film with lots of creepy, bizarre moments that a studio might not 'get.'"<ref>{{cite web|title=Original Saw Director James Wan on His Horror-Movie Comeback|url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/09/james_wan_on_his_horror-movie.html|work=Vulture|publisher=New York Media LLC|accessdate=14 December 2012|author=Grady Hendrix|date=21 September 2010}}</ref> Both Wan and Whannel stated that they wanted to use techniques such as restraint and silence to create a horror film, similar to ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]'' and [[David Lynch]]'s films.

Following the release of ''Insidious'', Wan revealed in an interview, in regard to his career beyond the film: "I definitely do want to experiment in other genres, or make films in other genres because I love, Leigh and I have, we're not just horror fans. We're film fans. I love action films. I want to do action films. I want to do romantic comedies. I love all this stuff. So, if I find the good material, I'll do it."<ref name="Click" />

The horror film news website Bloody Disgusting confirmed Wan's directorial involvement with a film entitled ''The Warren Files''. The film, later retitled ''The Conjuring'', centred on the real life exploits of [[Ed and Lorraine Warren]], a married couple that investigated paranormal events.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vera Farmiga And Patrick Wilson In Talks To Do Some 'Conjuring’ For James Wan|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/28000/vera-farmiga-and-patrick-wilson-in-talks-to-do-some-conjuring-for-james-wan/|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=Bloody Disgusting LLC|accessdate=1 August 2012|author=EvanDickson|date=20 January 2012}}</ref> The film focused on the couple's most famous case second to the Amityville haunting, in which they investigated a witch's curse on a Rhode Island family farm. In his second collaboration with the pair, Patrick Wilson featured in the film, and he and actress Vera Farmiga played paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, respectively.<ref name="Rabid">{{cite web|title=New Line Cinema Assembles 'The Warren Files'|url=http://www.rabiddoll.com/node/2031/new-line-cinema-assembles-the-warren-files.html|work=Rabid Doll|publisher=Nexus Media Group Inc|accessdate=1 August 2012|author=BRYANT L.

At that stage, Wan had several more weeks before the film was completed. The film was released in July 2013,<ref name="Nycc">{{cite web|title=NYCC Exclusive: James Wan & Patrick Wilson on Insidious 2|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/170453-nycc-exclusive-james-wan-a-patrick-wilson-on-insidious-2|work=Shock Till You Drop|publisher=CraveOnline Media, LLC|accessdate=14 December 2012|author=Edward Douglas|date=14 October 2012}}</ref> and has received acclaim from critics and audiences alike.

After work on ''The Conjuring'' was complete, Wan directed a sequel to 2010's ''Insidious''. The film was once again written by Wan's longtime collaborator and close friend, Whannel, and the cast of the original film returned. Filming for the sequel commenced in January 2013, and the film was released on 13 September 2013. The budget for the film had been described as "shoestring" by one media outlet. Oren Peli, the creator of the ''Paranormal Activity'' franchise, returned as an executive producer.<ref>{{cite web|title='Insidious' star Barbara Hershey to reprise role for sequel|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a444751/insidious-star-barbara-hershey-to-reprise-role-for-sequel.html|work=Digital Spy|publisher=Hearst Magazines UK|accessdate=14 December 2012|author=Mark Langshaw|date=12 December 2012}}</ref> Film District distributed ''Insidious: Chapter 2''.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Wan brings Barnbara Hershey back for "Insidious 2"|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/james-wan-brings-barbara-hershey-back-for-insidious-2|work=Arrow in the Head ad. 2000|publisher=Joblo Media Inc|accessdate=14 December 2012|author=Eric Walkuski|date=11 December 2012}}</ref>

Wan stated in an interview following a test screening of ''The Conjuring'':

<blockquote>
I think the sequel to 'Insidious’ is kind of my reaction to ''Saw'', where for my own reason I wasn’t as involved in the sequels, and so I felt with ''Insidious'', I think it would be good to shepherd it and keep it more in track to the version I had when I made the first film so that it doesn’t detour too far. So yeah, I’m kind of working with Leigh [Whannell] on the story and the script.

I never set out to make sequels to any of my films I direct," Wan further explained. "If they happen, that’s great because that means people out there love it and they want more of it, but I always felt with ''Insidious'' we created this really interesting world that we can explore more, and so even though we didn’t set out to make a sequel, I felt that there are stories still out there that could be told.<ref name="Nycc" /></blockquote>

===2014–present: ''Furious 7'', ''The Conjuring 2''===
In early 2013, Wan entered into negotiations with [[Universal Pictures]] to direct the seventh installment of the ''[[The Fast and the Furious (series)|Fast and Furious]]'' action franchise after [[Justin Lin]], who directed the previous four sequels, confirmed that he would not continue as director in January 2013. Wan was part of a directorial shortlist alongside [[Jeff Wadlow]], [[Baltasar Kormákur]] and [[Harald Zwart]].<ref>{{cite web|title=James Wan To Direct Fast & Furious 7|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/james-wan-direct-fast-furious-7/?_r=true|work=We Got This Covered|publisher=WeGotThisCovered|accessdate=26 April 2013|author=Gem Seddon|date=12 April 2013}}</ref> A final confirmation that Wan would direct was revealed in April 2013,<ref>{{cite web|title=CinemaCon: Fast & Furious 7 Release Date Announced!|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/cinemaconnews.php?id=103075|work=ComingSoon.net|publisher=CraveOnline Media, LLC, an Evolve Media, LLC company|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=16 April 2013}}</ref> with Lin being quoted: "It’s time for me to move on to other things and I’m thrilled that Universal and Neal have selected James Wan to lead the franchise into its new chapter."<ref>{{cite web|title=James Wan Is Universal’s Choice To Helm 'The Fast And The Furious 7′|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/04/james-wan-is-universals-choice-to-helm-the-fast-and-the-furious-7/|work=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=PMC|accessdate=18 April 2013|author=Mike Fleming Jr|date=10 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=James Wan to direct `Fast and Furious 7`|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/james-wan-to-direct-fast-and-furious-7_131932.htm|work=ZeeNews.com|publisher=Zee News Limited|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=12 April 2013}}</ref> The film, ''[[Furious 7]]'', was released in April 2015.

On 20 October 2014, the Gary Maddox of ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' announced that Wan had agreed to direct the ''Conjuring 2'' sequel as part of a significant long-term deal with New Line Cinema. Head of New Line, Toby Emmerich, explained that Wan is the sole director that the studio signed a deal with, as New Line considers Wan to be "a class of one".<ref>{{cite news|author1=Garry Maddox|title=James Wan to make Conjuring sequel: Short Cuts|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/james-wan-to-make-conjuring-sequel-short-cuts-20141022-1190jf.html|accessdate=26 October 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 October 2014}}</ref> The original release date for the sequel was 23 October 2015, but, according to media reports published in October 2014, New Line delayed the release to 10 June 2016.<ref name="Russ">{{cite web|author1=Russ Fischer|title='The Conjuring’ Sequel Pushed to 2016 [Updated]|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/conjuring-2-delayed/|website=Slash Film|publisher=Slash Film|accessdate=26 October 2014|date=21 October 2014}}</ref>

==Producer==
Wan produced ''[[Demonic (film)|Demonic]]'', a Dimension Films horror movie that was scheduled for a December 2014 release, alongside Lee Clay. Wan conceived of the idea for the film, which is directed by Will Canon and features Maria Bello in the lead acting role. Max La Bella penned the script.<ref>{{cite news|title=James Wan's 'Demonic,' starring Maria Bello, set for December release|url=http://bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/movie_news/2014/07/james_wans_demonic_starring_maria_bello_set_for_december|accessdate=7 August 2014|work=Boston Herald|date=31 July 2014}}</ref>

Wan then served as a producer on ''[[Annabelle (film)|Annabelle]]'', a spin-off of ''The Conjuring'' that served as a prequel to the 2013 film. The spin-off was profitable for the New Line film production company, as it was made for a cost of US$6.5 million and, as of 21 October 2014, had grossed US$166 million worldwide since it was publicly launched on 5 October 2014.<ref name="Russ" />

==Unreleased projects==
It was announced that an adaptation of the graphic novel ''Nightfall'' was to be Wan's next film after ''Death Sentence''. The plot involves the events that take place after a criminal is sent to a Texas prison run by vampires.<ref>{{cite web|title=SAW Creator James Wan Takes On Vampires in Night Fall|url=http://www.horror-movies.ca/horror_18885.html|work=HorrorMovies.ca|publisher=Horror Movies.ca|accessdate=15 September 2012|author=Herner Klenthur aka Meh|year=2012}}</ref> However, as of December 2012, the director's [[IMDB]] page does not list the film, nor is the project classified as a film in "pre-production" or a project in the "filming" stage.

In 2009, a Whannel–Wan collaborative project, called "X Ray", was announced and was described as a new "film noir/action project", with producer Robbie Brenner also attached to the project; however, as of December 2012, no further developments were reported.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Wan, Leigh Whannell Observe X-Ray|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=57614|work=ComingSoon.net|publisher=CraveOnline Media, LLC|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=29 July 2009}}</ref>
