'''Henri-Georges Clouzot''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ʁi ʒɔʁʒ kluzo}}; {{Birth date|df=yes|1907|08|18}} – {{Death date|df=yes|1977|01|12}}) was a French film director, screenwriter and producer. He is best remembered for his work in the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller film]] genre, having directed ''[[The Wages of Fear]]'' and ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]'', which are critically recognized to be among the greatest films from the 1950s. Clouzot also directed documentary films, including ''[[The Mystery of Picasso]]'', which was declared a national treasure by the government of France.

Clouzot was an early fan of the cinema and, desiring a career as a writer, moved to [[Paris]]. He was later hired by producer [[Adolphe Osso]] to work in [[Berlin]], writing French-language versions of German films. After being fired from German studios due to his friendship with Jewish producers, Clouzot returned to France, where he spent years bedridden after contracting [[tuberculosis]]. Upon recovering, Clouzot found work in [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi occupied France]] as a screenwriter for the German-owned company [[Continental Films]]. At Continental, Clouzot wrote and directed films that were very popular in France. His second film ''[[Le Corbeau]]'' drew controversy over its harsh look at provincial France and Clouzot was fired from Continental before its release. As a result of his association with Continental, Clouzot was barred by the French government from filmmaking until 1947.

After the ban was lifted, Clouzot reestablished his reputation and popularity in France during the late 1940s with successful films including ''[[Quai des Orfèvres]]''. After the release of his comedy film ''[[Miquette et sa mère]]'', Clouzot married [[Véra Clouzot|Véra Gibson-Amado]], who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for ''[[The Wages of Fear]]'' and ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]''. Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of ''[[La Vérité (film)|La Vérité]]'', Clouzot's wife Véra died of a heart attack and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the [[French New Wave]]. Clouzot's career became less active in later years, limited to a few [[television movie|television]] [[documentary film|documentaries]] and two feature films in the 1960s. Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.

}}</ref> In 1931, he made his first [[short film]], ''La Terreur des Batignolles'', from a script by [[Jacques de Baroncelli]]. The film is a 15-minute comedy with three actors.<ref name="Lloyd5" /> Film historian and critic [[Claude Beylie]] reported this short was "surprisingly well made with expressive use of shadows and lighting contrasts that Clouzot would exploit on the full-length features he would make years later".<ref name="Lloyd5" /> Clouzot's later wife, Inès de Gonzalez, said in 2004 that ''La Terreur des Batignolles'' added nothing to Clouzot's reputation.<ref name="Lloyd5" /> In Berlin, Clouzot saw several parades for [[Adolf Hitler]] and was shocked at how oblivious he felt France was to what was happening in Germany.<ref name="TET" /> In 1934, Clouzot was fired from [[Universum Film AG|UFA Studios]] for his friendship with [[Jew]]ish film producers such as Adolphe Osso and [[Pierre Lazareffe]].<ref name="TET" />

In 1935, Clouzot was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and was sent first to [[Haute-Savoie]] and then to [[Switzerland]], where he was bedridden for nearly five years in all.<ref name="Godin" /> Clouzot's time in the [[sanatorium]] would be very influential on his career. While bedridden, Clouzot read constantly and learned the mechanics of storytelling to help improve his scripts.<ref name="Godin" /> Clouzot also studied the fragile nature of the other people in the sanatorium.<ref name="TET" /> Clouzot had little money during this period, and was provided with financial and moral support by his family and friends.<ref name="TET" /> By the time Clouzot left the sanatorium and returned to Paris, [[World War II]] had broken out.<ref name="TET" /><ref name="Mayne22">Mayne 2007, p.22</ref> [[Cinema of France|French cinema]] had changed because many of the producers he had known had fled France to escape [[Nazism]].<ref name="TET" />

Clouzot's health problems kept him from military service.<ref name="Mayne22" /> In 1939, he met actor [[Pierre Fresnay]], who was already an established film star in France. Clouzot wrote the script for Fresnay's only directorial feature ''Le Duel'', as well as two plays for him: ''On prend les mêmes'', which was performed in December 1940, and ''Comédie en trois actes'', which was performed in 1942.<ref name="Lloyd6" /> Despite writing scripts for films and plays, Clouzot was so poor that he resorted to trying to sell lyrics to French singer [[Édith Piaf]], who declined to purchase them.<ref name="Lloyd2">Lloyd 2007, p. 2.</ref> After France was invaded by Germany and subsequently during the [[German occupation of France during World War II]], the German-operated film production company [[Continental Films]] was established in France in October 1940.<ref name="Lloyd30">Lloyd 2007, p. 30</ref> [[Alfred Grevin]], the director of Continental, knew Clouzot from Berlin and offered him work to adapt stories of writer [[Stanislas-André Steeman]].<ref name="Mayne22" /><ref name="Lloyd30" /> Clouzot felt uncomfortable working for the Germans, but was in desperate need of money and could not refuse Grevin's offer.<ref name="TET" /> Clouzot's first film for Continental was the adaptation of Steeman's [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]] novel ''Six hommes mort'' (''Six Dead Men'').<ref name="Mayne22" /> Clouzot retitled the film ''Le Dernier de six'', having been influenced by actress [[Suzy Delair]] while writing the script, allowing her to choose the name of the character she would play.<ref name="TET" />

====Return to filmmaking and acclaim (1947–1960)====

He scoured schools to find an actress for the lead role, and chose 17-year-old [[Cécile Aubry]] after viewing over 700 girls.<ref name="TET" /> ''Manon'' was released in 1948 and was watched by 3.4&nbsp;million filmgoers in France as well as winning the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref name="Lloyd3" /> Clouzot directed and wrote the short film ''Le Retour de Jean'', which was part of [[anthology film]] ''[[Return to Life]]''.<ref name="Hayward116">Hayward 2005, p. 116</ref> ''Le Retour de Jean'' was influenced by the short period when Clouzot lived in Germany in the early 1930s and stars [[Louis Jouvet]] as a survivor of a concentration camp who finds a wounded Nazi war criminal whom he interrogates and tortures.<ref name="TET" /><ref name="soc" /> Clouzot's next film was the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''[[Miquette et Sa Mère]]'', which was a financial failure.

The Brazilian government took issue with Clouzot filming the poverty of people in the [[favela]]s rather than the more picturesque parts of Brazil.<ref name="TET" /> The film was never finished because the costs became too high. Clouzot became fascinated with the region and wrote a book, ''Le cheval des dieux'', recounting his trip.<ref name="TET" /><ref name="soc" />

Upon returning to France, he was offered a script written by [[Georges-Jean Arnaud]], an expatriate living in [[South America]] who had written about his own experiences there. Clouzot found it easy to imagine the setting of the script and was very anxious to film Arnaud's story. He started writing the film, ''The Wages of Fear'', with his brother, Jean Clouzot, who would collaborate with him on all his subsequent films under the name of Jérôme Geronimi.<ref name="TET" /> Production on ''The Wages of Fear'' lasted from 1951 to 1952.<ref name="Lloyd7">Lloyd 2007, p. 7.</ref> In order to gain as much independence as possible, Clouzot created his own production company called Véra Films, which he named after his wife.<ref name="Lloyd7" /> The sole female role in ''The Wages of Fear'' is played by Véra.

''Les Espions'' would be the last acting role for Clouzot's wife Véra, who had been suffering from severe heart problems since filming ''Diabolique''.<ref name="TET" /> ''Les Espions'' is set in a rundown sanitarium that is taken over by international spies.

}}</ref> Véra Clouzot died of a heart attack shortly after the filming of ''La Vérité''. Clouzot fell into a depression over her death.<ref name="TET" /><ref name="Lloyd8" /> After her funeral, he moved to [[Tahiti]], but returned to France in December 1960.<ref name="Lloyd8" />

Clouzot met his second wife, Inès de Gonzalez, for the first time at a casting call for a film based on [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Laughter in the Dark (novel)|Laughter in the Dark]]''. In 1962, Clouzot met de Gonzalez again after she had returned from South America.<ref name="TET" /> In December 1963, Clouzot and Inès de Gonzalez married.<ref name="Lloyd8" /> In the 1960s, Clouzot converted to [[Roman Catholicism]].<ref name="Cinetom"/>

==Style==
With the exception of the comedy film ''Miquette et sa mère'', every directorial feature of Clouzot involves deception, betrayal and violent deaths.<ref name="Lloyd11">Lloyd 2007, p. 11</ref>
When basing screenplays on written work, Clouzot often changed the stories dramatically, using only key points of the original story. The author Stanislas-André Steeman, whom Clouzot worked with twice, said Clouzot would only "build something after having contemptuously demolished any resemblance to the original, purely for the ambition of effect".<ref name="Hayward3">Hayward 2005, p. 3.</ref> When writing for his own features, Clouzot created characters that were usually corrupt and spineless, with the capacity for both good and evil within them.<ref name="TET" />

Clouzot was very demanding with his actors and would often quarrel with them to get them in the mood he desired.<ref name="Hayward3" /> Suzy Delair recalled that Clouzot slapped her, but said of it, "So what? He slapped others as well...He was tough but I'm not about to complain".<ref name="Mayne28">Mayne 2007, p.28</ref><ref name="Mayne29">Mayne 2007, p.29</ref> Pierre Fresnay recalled that Clouzot "worked relentlessly, which made for a juicy spectacle...That's to say nothing for his taste of violence, which he never tried with me".<ref name="Mayne29" /> When working with Bardot, one scene required Bardot's character to drool and sleep. Clouzot offered her powerful sleeping pills, saying they were aspirin, and this led to Bardot's stomach being [[gastric lavage|pumped]].<ref name="TET" /> Although Clouzot was harsh on his actors, he did not treat them fiercely off set. Delair recalled that off set there was an "innocence about him" that was not seen.<ref name="TET" />

Clouzot biographer Marc Godin suggested Clouzot's life provides clues to understanding his style as a filmmaker.<ref name="Godin" /> Clouzot was viewed by many of his collaborators as a pessimist, short-tempered, and almost always angry.<ref name="Godin" /> Actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] described Clouzot as "a negative being, forever at odds with himself and the world around him".<ref name="Lloyd6" /> Clouzot's outlook on life is reflected in his own films that reveal the darker side of humanity.<ref name="Godin" />

==Legacy==
Despite criticism following the arrival of the French New Wave, career retrospectives of Clouzot's work have been positive. Twenty years after his death, film critic Noël Herpe wrote in the French film journal ''[[Positif (magazine)|Positif]]'' that "''Les Diaboliques'' (just like ''Les Espions'' and ''La Verite'') reveals a sterile and increasingly exaggerated urge to experiment with the powers of fiction".<ref name="Lloyd9">Lloyd 2007, p. 9</ref> Film historian Philipe Pilard wrote, "There is no doubt that if Clouzot had worked for Hollywood and applied the formulas of U.S. studios, today he would be lauded by the very critics who choose to ignore him".<ref name="Lloyd9" /> Clouzot today is generally known for his thriller films ''The Wages of Fear'' and ''Diabolique''.<ref name="Godin" /> Clouzot's ability in the genre led to comparisons with [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name="amgBio" /><ref>{{cite web|author=Schneider, Dan|title=Film Reviews: The Wages of Fear|url=http://www.noripcord.com/reviews/film/the-wages-of-fear|accessdate=19 August 2009|date=18 December 2008}}</ref><ref name="Lloyd10">Lloyd 2007, p. 10</ref> Clouzot respected Hitchcock's work, stating, "I admire him very much and am flattered when anyone compares a film of mine to his".<ref name="Chandler">Chandler 2006, p. 239</ref>

Several of Clouzot's films have been remade since their original releases. Director [[Otto Preminger]] adapted ''[[Le Corbeau]]'' into his 1951 film, ''[[The 13th Letter]]''.<ref name="Lloyd176">Lloyd 2007, p. 176</ref> In 1977, the year of Clouzot's death, [[William Friedkin]] directed a remake of ''The Wages of Fear'' called ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]''.<ref name="amgBio" /> French director [[Claude Chabrol]] adapted Clouzot's script for ''[[Henri-Georges Clouzot's Inferno|L'Enfer]]'' in 1994 also titled ''[[L'Enfer (1994 film)|L'Enfer]]''.<ref>{{cite web
