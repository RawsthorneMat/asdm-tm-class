<blockquote>"If anything, I'm a trier," says Kutcher between puffs of filtered Lucky Strikes. "I think, more than anything, it comes from the fact that my father always had several irons in the fire. Also, I don't want to fail. If something doesn't work out—if ''That '70s Show'' got canceled or if I wasn't going to have a film career—I always wanted to have backup contingency plans. So I just started doing other things; and on a half-hour sitcom, you're really only working for 30 hours a week.

===Social media presence ===
On April 16, 2009, Kutcher became the first user of Twitter to have more than 1,000,000 followers,<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/21/ashton-kutcher-celebrity-twitter|title=Inside Ashton Kutcher's world of Twitter|work=The Guardian |location=London|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=April 22, 2009 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090423052639/http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/21/ashton-kutcher-celebrity-twitter| archivedate= April 23, 2009| deadurl= no}}</ref> beating [[CNN]] in the site's "Million followers contest".<ref>{{cite news|first=  John D.|last=Sutter|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/15/ashton.cnn.twitter.battle |title= Ashton Kutcher challenges CNN to Twitter popularity contest |publisher=CNN  |date= April 15, 2009|accessdate=September 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609461/20090417/story.jhtml |title=Ashton Kutcher Beats CNN In Twitter-Off|publisher=MTV |date=April 17, 2009 |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}</ref> However, there have been several reports that Twitter manipulated the contest's results by preventing users from "unfollowing" Kutcher or CNN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Needleman |first=Rafe |url=http://news.cnet.com/how-to-unfollow-ashton-kutcher |title=How to unfollow Ashton Kutcher |publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=September 5, 2010}}</ref> 

In November 2011, Kutcher received much criticism for his tweet in response to the [[Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal]] calling the firing of [[Penn State Nittany Lions football]] coach [[Joe Paterno]] in "poor taste".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20544258,00.html|title=Ashton Kutcher Sorry for His Ignorance in Defending Joe Paterno|author=Nudd, Tim|work=People|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=June 9, 2013}}</ref> Kutcher subsequently turned over management of his Twitter account to his team at the Katalyst Media company.<ref>{{cite web|author=Shira, Dahvi|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20544312,00.html|title=Ashton Kutcher Giving Up Management of His Twitter Feed|work=People|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=June 9, 2013}}</ref>

On March 8, 2015, Kutcher sparked a national debate regarding the lack of equal access to diaper changing facilities in men's restrooms with this [[Facebook]] post:  "There are NEVER diaper changing stations in mens public restrooms. The first public men's room that I go into that has one gets a free shout out on my FB page! #BeTheChange".  This post received more than 244,000 'Likes', 11,500 comments, and was reposted more than 14,000 times.

Kutcher has leveraged his social media presence, particularly on [[Facebook]], to post and promote content published by [[A Plus (aplus.com)|A Plus]], a social media-driven content platform and associated company that he is Chairman of.<ref name=bi_price/>

=== Controversy ===
In April 2011, Kutcher and then-wife Demi Moore began a [[public service announcement]] campaign claiming that "Real Men" do not engage the services of child prostitutes who are the victims of [[human trafficking]].<ref name="CNN">{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-14/world/kutcher.moore.piers.morgan_1_human-trafficking-child-prostitution-end-child?_s=PM:WORLD|title=Moore, Kutcher: Join our crusade to end child sex trafficking|work=CNN |date=April 14, 2011|accessdate=July 2011 }}</ref> Kutcher's claims that 100,000 to 300,000 American children were sold into sexual slavery were criticized by newspaper ''[[The Village Voice]]'', which gave evidence refuting the claims. Kutcher may have understood a study referring to minors "at risk" for sexual exploitation as referring to children actually being prostituted. Experts estimate the true numbers to be in the hundreds, not the hundreds of thousands.<ref name="Village Voice">{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2011-06-29/news/real-men-get-their-facts-straight-sex-trafficking-ashton-kutcher-demi-moore/|title=Real Men Get Their Facts Straight|work=The Village Voice |location=New York|date=April 14, 2011|accessdate=July 15, 2011 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110701215931/http://www.villagevoice.com/2011-06-29/news/real-men-get-their-facts-straight-sex-trafficking-ashton-kutcher-demi-moore/| archivedate= July 1, 2011| deadurl= no}}</ref> Kutcher reacted to the criticism by accusing the ''Village Voice'' of promoting child prostitution and using Twitter to request that ''The Village Voice'' advertisers including [[American Airlines]], [[Disney]], the [[Seattle|City of Seattle]], and [[Domino's Pizza]] withdraw their advertising from publications owned by the ''Voice''{{'}}s parent company.<ref name="Gawker">{{cite news |url=http://gawker.com/5817554/ashton-kutcher-will-destroy-newspaper-over-sex-slavery-article|title=Ashton Kutcher Will Destroy Newspaper Over Sex Slavery Article|work=Gawker |date=July 1, 2011|accessdate=July 2011}}</ref><ref name="BoingBoing">{{cite web|author=Xeni Jardin |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2011/07/01/ashton-kutcher-bulli.html |title=Ashton Kutcher bullies Village Voice over sex slavery hype-debunking cover story |publisher=Boing Boing |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2013}}</ref>
