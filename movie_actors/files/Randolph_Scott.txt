'''George Randolph Scott''' (January 23, 1898 – March 2, 1987) was an American film actor whose career spanned from 1928 to 1962. As a leading man for all but the first three years of his cinematic career, Scott appeared in a variety of genres, including social dramas, crime dramas, [[comedies]], [[musicals]] (albeit in non-singing and non-dancing roles), adventure tales, [[war films]], and a few [[Horror film|horror]] and [[fantasy]] films. However, his most enduring image is that of the tall-in-the-saddle [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. Out of his more than 100 film appearances over 60 were in Westerns; thus, "of all the major stars whose name was associated with the Western, Scott most closely identified with it."<ref name="BFI">Boscombe, Edward (ed). ''The BFI Companion to the Western.'' New York: DiCapo Press, 1988.</ref>

Scott's more than 30 years as a motion picture actor resulted in his working with many acclaimed screen directors, including [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]], [[Rouben Mamoulian]], [[Michael Curtiz]], [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]], [[King Vidor]], [[Allan Dwan]], [[Fritz Lang]], and [[Sam Peckinpah]]. He also worked on multiple occasions with prominent directors: [[Henry Hathaway]] (eight times), [[Ray Enright]] (seven), Edwin R. Marin (seven), [[André de Toth]] (six), and most notably, his seven film collaborations with [[Budd Boetticher]]. Scott also worked with a diverse array of cinematic leading ladies, from [[Shirley Temple]] and [[Irene Dunne]] to [[Mae West]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]].

Tall (6&nbsp;ft 2½in; 189&nbsp;cm), lanky and handsome, Scott displayed an easygoing charm and courtly Southern drawl in his early films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or "lumbering".<ref>Mueller 1985, p. 65.</ref> As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal "strong, silent" type of stoic hero. ''The BFI Companion to the Western'' noted:<blockquote>In his earlier Westerns&nbsp;... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes the man who has seen it all, who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (but at what cost?) a stoic calm proof against vicissitude.<ref name="BFI"/></blockquote>

During the early 1950s, Scott was a consistent box-office draw. In the annual ''Motion Picture Herald'' Top Ten Polls, he ranked 10th in 1950, seventh in 1951, and 10th in both 1952 and 1953.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 4.</ref> Scott also appeared in the Quigley's ''Top Ten Money Makers Poll'' from 1950 to 1953.<ref>[http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html "Top Ten Money Making Stars of the past 79 years."] ''quigleypublishing.com.''

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Early years==
Scott was born in [[Orange County, Virginia|Orange County]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]], but reared in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], the second of six children born to parents of Scottish-American descent. His father was George Grant Scott, born in [[Franklin, Virginia]], an administrative engineer in a textile firm. His mother was Lucille Crane Scott, born in [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]], Virginia, a member of a wealthy North Carolina family.<ref name="Nott p. 7">Nott 2004, p. 7.</ref> The Scott children in order of birth were: Margaret, Randolph, Katherine, Virginia, Joseph and Barbara, most born in North Carolina.<ref>U.S. Census 1900–1920.</ref>

Because of his family's financial status, young Randolph was able to attend private schools such as [[Woodberry Forest School]]. From an early age, Scott developed and displayed an athletic trait, excelling in American [[american football|football]], baseball, horse racing, and swimming.<ref name="Nott p. 7"/>

==World War I==
In April 1917, the United States entered [[World War I]] and shortly afterwards, Scott, then  19 years old, joined the [[United States Army]]. He served in France as an artillery observer with the 2nd Trench Mortar Battalion, 19th Field Artillery.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 1.</ref> His wartime experience would give him training that would be put to use in his later film career,  including [[horsemanship]] and the use of [[firearms]].

==Post World War I career==
After the [[Armistice]] brought [[World War I]] to an end, Scott stayed in France and  enrolled in an artillery officers' school. Although he eventually received a commission, Scott decided to return to America and thus journeyed home around 1919.<ref name="Nott p. 8">Nott 2004, p. 8.</ref>

With his military career over, Scott continued his education at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] where he set his sights on becoming an all-American football player. However a back injury prevented him from achieving this goal.<ref name="Thomas">Thomas, Tony. ''Hollywood and the American Image.'' Westport, Connecticut: Arlington House, 1981. ISBN 978-0-87000-525-1.</ref> Scott then transferred to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he majored in [[textile engineering]] and manufacturing.<ref name="Nott p. 8"/> As with his military career, however, he eventually dropped out of college and went to work as an accountant in the textile firm where his father was employed.<ref>Ringgold, Gene. "Randolph Scott: Everyone's Idea of a Southern Gentleman." ''Films in Review.'' 1972.</ref>

==Stage and early film appearances==
Around 1927, Scott developed an interest in acting and decided to make his way to Los Angeles and seek a career in the motion picture industry. Fortunately, Scott's father had become acquainted with [[Howard Hughes]] and provided a letter of introduction for his son to present to the eccentric millionaire filmmaker.<ref name="Thomas"/> Hughes responded by getting Scott a small part in a [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] film called ''[[Sharp Shooters]]'' (1928). Despite its title and the presence of O'Brien, ''Sharp Shooters'' is not a western, as some film historians claimed. Rather, it's a romantic comedy. A print of the film survives in the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].

In the next few years, Scott continued working as an extra and bit player in several films, including ''Weary River'' (1929) with [[Richard Barthelmess]] and ''[[The Virginian (1929 film)|The Virginian]]'' (1929) with [[Gary Cooper]]. Reputedly, Scott also served as Cooper's dialect coach in this latter film.

On the advice of director [[Cecil B. DeMille]], Scott also gained much-needed acting experience by performing in stage plays with the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. Scott's stage roles during this period include:<ref>Nott 2004, p. 136.</ref>
* A minister in ''Gentlemen Be Seated''
* A butler in ''Nellie, the Beautiful Model''
* Metellus Cimber in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''
* Hector Malone in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Man and Superman]]''

In 1931 Scott played his first leading role (with [[Sally Blane]]) in ''Women Men Marry'', a [[lost film|film]], now apparently lost, that was made by a [[Poverty Row]] studio called Headline Pictures. He followed that movie with a supporting part in a [[Warner Bros.]] production starring [[George Arliss]], ''A Successful Calamity''. In 1932 Scott appeared in a play at the Vine Street Theatre in [[Hollywood]] entitled ''Under a Virginia Moon''. His performance in this play resulted in several offers for screen tests by the major movie studios.<ref name="Thomas"/> Scott eventually signed a seven-year contract with [[Paramount Pictures]] at a salary of US$400 per week (adjusted for inflation, US$400 in 1932 is the equivalent of approximately US$4800 in 2006).<ref>Nott 2004, p. 10.</ref>

==Paramount years==

===Zane Grey apprenticeship===
Scott's first role under his new [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] contract was a small supporting part in a comedy called ''Sky Bride'' (1932) starring [[Richard Arlen]] and [[Jack Oakie]]. Following that, however, Paramount cast him as the lead in ''[[Heritage of the Desert]]'' (1932), his first significant starring role and also the one that established him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] hero. As with ''Women Men Marry'', [[Sally Blane]] was his leading lady. The film was the first of ten "B" [[Western (genre)|Western]] films that Scott made for Paramount in a series loosely based on the novels of [[Zane Grey]]. Around the same time, [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] also remade some [[Zane Grey]] titles that they owned, with [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as their star. [[Henry Hathaway]] made his directorial debut with ''Heritage of the Desert''; he would go on to direct a total of seven out of the 10 [[Zane Grey]] adaptations that Scott would appear in. Hathaway also directed one film in the [[Zane Grey]] series without Scott: ''Under the Tonto Rim'' (1933) starring [[Stuart Erwin]].

[[File:Poster - Man of the Forest (1933) 02.jpg|thumb|With Verna Hillie in ''Man of the Forest'', 1933]]
Many of these Grey adaptations were remakes of earlier silent films. In an effort to save on production costs, Paramount utilized stock footage from the silent version and even hired some of the same actors, such as [[Raymond Hatton]] and [[Noah Beery, Sr.|Noah Beery]], to repeat their roles. For the 1933 films ''[[The Thundering Herd]]'' and ''[[Man of the Forest]]'', Scott's hair was darkened and he sported a trim moustache so that he could easily be matched to footage of [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], the star of the silent versions. 

In his book, ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers'', film historian [[William K. Everson]] refers to the Zane Grey series as being "uniformly good".<ref name="Everson">Everson, William K. ''The Hollywood Western: Ninety Years of Cowboys and Indians, Train Robbers, Sheriffs and Gunslingers.'' New York. Citadel Press, 1992, First edition 1969.</ref> He also writes:<blockquote>''To the Last Man'' was almost a model of its kind, an exceptionally strong story of feuding families in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, with a cast worthy of an "A" feature, excellent direction by [[Henry Hathaway]], and an unusual climactic fight between the villain (Jack LaRue) and the ''heroine'' ([[Esther Ralston]], in an exceptionally appealing performance).

''Sunset Pass''...&nbsp;was not only one of the best but also one of the most surprising in presenting Randolph Scott and [[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]] as ''heavies.''</blockquote>

The Zane Grey series were a boon for Scott, as they provided him with "an excellent training ground for both action and acting".<ref>Nott 2005, p. 9.</ref>

===Non-Western roles for Paramount===
{{POV|date=October 2013}}

In between his work in the Zane Grey [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, Paramount cast Scott in several non-[[Western (genre)|Western]] roles, such as "the other man" in ''[[Hot Saturday]]'' (1932), with [[Nancy Carroll]] and [[Cary Grant]]; ''Hello, Everybody!'' (1933), an odd one-shot attempt to make a film star out of the popular but heavy-set radio singer [[Kate Smith]]; and ''[[Go West, Young Man]]'' (1936).

Paramount cast Scott in two horror films: ''[[Murders in the Zoo]]'' (1933) with [[Lionel Atwill]], and ''Supernatural'' (1933) with [[Carole Lombard]]. Paramount also loaned him to work at other studios, including [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], where he appeared with [[Bebe Daniels]] in a minor romantic comedy called ''[[Cocktail Hour (film)|Cocktail Hour]]'' (1933).

===Star on the rise===
By 1935 Scott was firmly established as a popular movie star and, thus, following the release of ''Rocky Mountain Mystery'' (1935), Paramount moved him up from his "B" [[Western (genre)|Western]] status to a star of "A" features, many on loan out.

Scott made four films for [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] during 1935–36. Two of these were in the popular series of [[musicals]] starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]: ''[[Roberta (1935 film)|Roberta]]'' (1935), also starring [[Irene Dunne]], and ''[[Follow the Fleet]]'' (1936). In both of these films Scott played [[Fred Astaire|Astaire's]] lunkheaded but likable pal. The other two were among the best in Scott's career: ''Village Tale'' (1935), "a touching, still-obscure melodrama about small-town gossip and hypocrisy"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 43.</ref> directed by [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]], and ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' (1935), a superb adventure-fantasy adapted from [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s 1886 [[She (novel)|novel]].

In 1936, Scott, on loan to independent producer [[Edward Small]], starred in another adventure classic, ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1936 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'', adapted from the 1826 [[The Last of the Mohicans|novel]] by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]. A big hit in its day, the film "gave Scott his first unqualified 'A' picture success as a lead."<ref>Nott 2004, p. 58.</ref>

Scott's films at Paramount include the aforementioned ''Go West, Young Man'' (1936), which reunited him with director [[Henry Hathaway]] and in [[Mae West]]'s adaptation of [[Lawrence Riley]]'s Broadway hit comedy ''Personal Appearance''; ''[[So Red the Rose (1935 film)|So Red the Rose]]'' (1936), directed by [[King Vidor]] and starring [[Margaret Sullavan]]; and ''[[High, Wide, and Handsome]]''. This last film, a musical directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], featured Scott in his "most ambitious performance,"<ref>Nott 2004, p. 59.</ref> The film is&nbsp;...
<blockquote>...&nbsp;set in 1859 in [[Pennsylvania]], and follows the exploits of oil prospector Scott as he struggles against various varmints and vested interests out to wreck his business, and tries to keep his marriage to [[Irene Dunne]] intact, despite the tempting presence of saloon singer [[Dorothy Lamour]].<ref name="BFI"/></blockquote>

===Heroes, heavies and other roles===
In 1938 Scott finished his contract with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and began freelancing. Some of the roles that he took over the next few years were supporting ones, while his other roles during the same time frame had him occasionally lapse into villainy. One missed opportunity also came about around this time. Due to his Southern background, Scott was considered for the role of [[Ashley Wilkes]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', but it was [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] who eventually got the part.

For [[20th Century Fox]] Scott supported child star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938) and ''[[Susannah of the Mounties (film)|Susannah of the Mounties]]'' (1939). For the same studio he played a supporting role in his first [[Technicolor]] film, ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' (1939), a lavish highly romanticized account of the famous [[Jesse James|outlaw]] ([[Tyrone Power]]) and his brother [[Frank James|Frank]] ([[Henry Fonda]]). Shortly after making this film, Scott portrayed [[Wyatt Earp]] in ''[[Frontier Marshal (1939 film)|Frontier Marshal]]'' (1939) and, for [[Universal Studios|Universal]], starred with [[Kay Francis]] in ''[[When the Daltons Rode]]'' (1940).

Scott followed this by co-starring with [[Errol Flynn]] in ''[[Virginia City (film)|Virginia City]]'' (1940) and played the "other man" role in the [[Irene Dunne]]–[[Cary Grant]] romantic comedy ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940).

In 1941 Scott returned to [[Zane Grey]] country by co-starring with [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]] in the [[Technicolor]] production ''[[Western Union (film)|Western Union]]'', directed by [[Fritz Lang]]. Scott played a "good bad man" in this film and gave one of his finest performances. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:

<blockquote>Randolph Scott, who is getting to look and act more and more like [[William S. Hart]], herein shapes one of the truest and most appreciable characters of his career as the party's scout.<ref>''[[The New York Times]],'' February 7, 1941.</ref></blockquote>

In 1941, Scott also co-starred with a young [[Gene Tierney]] in another western, ''[[Belle Starr (film)|Belle Starr]]''. Scott's only role as a truly evil villain was in [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', a rip-roaring adaptation of [[Rex Beach]]'s 1905 tale of the [[Klondike gold rush|Alaskan gold rush]] co-starring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[John Wayne]]. The movie's climax featured Scott and [[John Wayne|Wayne]] (and their stunt doubles) in one of the most spectacular fistfights ever filmed. The [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]]-Scott-[[John Wayne|Wayne]] combination worked so well that [[Universal Studios|Universal]] recast the trio the following year in ''[[Pittsburgh (1942 film)|Pittsburgh]]'', a war-time action-melodrama which had [[John Wayne|Wayne]] and Scott slugging it out once more.

In 1943 Scott starred in ''[[The Desperados]]'', [[Columbia Pictures]]' first feature in [[Technicolor]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Joe Brown]], with whom Scott would form a business partnership several years later.

===World War II===
Shortly after the United States entered World War II, Scott attempted to obtain an officer's commission in the [[United States Marines|Marines]], but because of a back injury years earlier, he was rejected.<ref name="Thomas"/> However, he did his part for the war effort by touring in a comedy act with [[Joe DeRita]] (who later became a member of [[the Three Stooges]]) for the Victory Committee showcases, and he also raised food for the government on a ranch that he owned.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 67.</ref>

In 1942 and 1943, Scott appeared in several war films, notably ''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]'', ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'', the Canadian warship drama ''[[Corvette K-225]]'', ''[[Gung Ho! (1943 film)|Gung Ho!]]'' and ''[[China Sky (film)|China Sky]].''

===Tall in the saddle===
[[File:Abilene Town 1946 (2).jpg|thumb|With Jack Lambert in ''Abilene Town'', 1946]]
In 1946, after playing roles that had him wandering in and out of the saddle for many years, including a role alongside Charles Laughton in the cheaply made production ''[[Captain Kidd (1945 film)|Captain Kidd]]'' (1945), Scott appeared in ''[[Abilene Town]]'', a [[United Artists|UA]]<ref>''Halliwell's Film Guide 2008,'' p. 8.</ref> release which cast him in what would become one of his classic images, the fearless lawman cleaning up a lawless town. The film "cemented Scott's position as a cowboy hero"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 15.</ref> and from this point on all but two of his starring films would be [[Westerns]]. The Scott Westerns of the late 1940s would each be budgeted  around US$1,000,000, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1946}}}} today.

Scott renewed his acquaintance with producer [[Harry Joe Brown]] and together they began producing many of Scott's Westerns, including several that were shot in the two-color [[Cinecolor]] process. Their collaboration produced the superior ''[[Coroner Creek]]'' (1948) with Scott as a vengeance-driven cowpoke who "predates the [[Budd Boetticher]]/[[Burt Kennedy]] heroes by nearly a decade,"<ref>Nott 2005, p. 29.</ref> ''[[Gunfighters (film)|Gunfighters]]'' (1947) based on the [[Zane Grey]] novel ''Two Sombreros'', and ''[[The Walking Hills]]'' (1949), a modern-day tale of gold hunters.

Scott also made [[Westerns]] for Nat Holt. Some of these movies, ''[[Badman's Territory]]'', ''[[Trail Street]]'', and ''[[Rage at Dawn]]'' were released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], while others, like ''[[Fighting Man of the Plains]]'', ''[[Canadian Pacific (film)|Canadian Pacific]]'', and ''[[The Cariboo Trail]]'' were released by Twentieth Century Fox. In the late 1940s and early 1950s Scott's films were made mainly for [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] or [[Warner Bros.]] His salary for the latter studio was US$100,000 per picture (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1949}}}} today).

Scott's pictures from this period include the 1950 ''[[Colt .45 (film)|Colt .45]]'', the 1951 films ''[[Fort Worth (1951 film)|Fort Worth]]'', ''[[Man in the Saddle (1952 film)|Man in the Saddle]]'' and ''[[Carson City (1952 film)|Carson City]]'', and the 1952 films ''[[Hangman's Knot]]'' (which Scott produced), ''[[The Man Behind the Gun]]'', ''[[The Stranger Wore a Gun]]'' (filmed in [[3-D film|3-D]]), and ''[[Thunder Over the Plains]]''. Also in 1953, Scott appeared in ''[[Riding Shotgun (film)|Riding Shotgun]]'', an unusual [[Western (genre)|Western]] that presents (probably unintentionally) some [[McCarthyism|McCarthyistic]] overtones. In 1954, Scott played a laconic good guy in ''[[The Bounty Hunter (1954 film)|The Bounty Hunter]]''.  Most of  these were directed by [[André de Toth]].

Scott also made ''Rage at Dawn'' in 1955 for Nat Holt, which was released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] starring Scott and [[Forrest Tucker]], and featuring [[Denver Pyle]], [[Edgar Buchanan]], and [[J. Carrol Naish]]. It purports to tell the true story of the [[Reno Gang|Reno Brothers]], an outlaw gang which terrorized the American Midwest, particularly Southern [[Indiana]], soon after the [[American Civil War]].

Also of interest is ''[[Shootout at Medicine Bend]]'' shot in 1955, but released in 1957, which was Scott's last movie in black and white. The movie co-stars [[James Garner]] and [[Angie Dickinson]].<ref>''Halliwell's Film Guide 2008,'' p. 1071.</ref>

By 1956, Scott turned 58, an age where the careers of most leading men would be winding down. Scott, however, was about to enter his finest and most acclaimed period.

===The Boetticher and Kennedy films===
[[File:Nancy Gates and Randolph Scott in Comanche Station.png|thumb|upright=1.3|With Nancy Gates in ''Commanche Station'', 1960]]
In 1955, screenwriter [[Burt Kennedy]] wrote a script entitled ''[[Seven Men from Now]]'' which was scheduled to be filmed by [[John Wayne]]'s [[Batjac Productions]] with Wayne as the film's star and [[Budd Boetticher]] as its director. However, Wayne was already committed to [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''. Wayne therefore suggested Scott as his replacement.<ref>Nott 2005, p. 131.</ref> The resulting film, released in 1956, did not make a great impact at the time but is now regarded by many as one of Scott's best, as well as the one that launched Scott and Boetticher into a successful collaboration that totaled seven films. While each film is independent and there are no shared characters or settings, this set of films is often called the Ranown Cycle, for the production company run by Scott and Harry Joe Brown, which was involved in their production.<ref>Wilmington, Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-11-29/entertainment/ca-2438_1_budd-boetticher "Tall in the Director's Chair Budd Boetticher made some of the best-remembered Westerns of '50s and '60s; they don't make 'em like that (or him) anymore."] ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 29, 1992, p. 4.</ref> Kennedy scripted four of them. In these films&nbsp;...
<blockquote>Boetticher achieved works of great beauty, formally precise in structure and visually elegant, notably for their use of the distinctive landscape of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|California Sierras]]. As the hero of these "floating poker games" (as [[Andrew Sarris]] calls them), Scott tempers their innately pessimistic view with quiet, stoical humour, as he pits his wits against such charming villains as [[Richard Boone]] in ''[[The Tall T]]'' and [[Claude Akins]] in ''[[Comanche Station]].''<ref name="BFI"/></blockquote>

;Scott and Boetticher films:
* ''[[Seven Men from Now]]'' (1956)
* ''[[The Tall T]]'' (1957)
* ''[[Decision at Sundown]]'' (1957)
* ''[[Buchanan Rides Alone]]'' (1958)
* ''[[Westbound (film)|Westbound]]'' (1959)
* ''[[Ride Lonesome]]'' (1959)
* ''[[Comanche Station]]'' (1960)

===''Ride the High Country'' (''1962'')===
In 1962 Scott made his final film appearance in ''[[Ride the High Country]]'', a film now regarded as a classic. It was directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]] and co-starred [[Joel McCrea]], an actor who had a screen image similar to Scott's and who also from the mid-1940s on devoted his career almost exclusively to [[Westerns]].

<blockquote>Scott and [[Joel McCrea|McCrea's]] farewell Western is characterized by a nostalgic sense of the passing of the Old West; a preoccupation with the emotionality of male bonding and of the experiential 'gap' between the young and the old; and the fearful evocation, in the form of the Hammonds (the villains in the film), of these preoccupations transmuted into brutal and perverse forms.<ref name="BFI"/></blockquote>[[Joel McCrea|McCrea]], like Scott, retired from filmmaking after this picture, although he returned to the screen twice in later years.

==Personal life==

===Final years===
Following ''Ride the High Country'', Scott retired from film at the age of 64. Having made shrewd investments throughout his life, he eventually accumulated a fortune worth a reputed $100&nbsp;million.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 191.</ref>

During his retirement years he remained friends with [[Fred Astaire]] and also became friends with the Reverend [[Billy Graham]]. Scott was described by his son Christopher as a deeply religious man.<ref>Nott 2004, p. 225.</ref> He was an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] and the Scott family were members of St. Peter's Episcopal Church in Charlotte, North Carolina.<ref>http://ncpedia.org/biography/scott-george-randolph</ref>

Scott died of heart and lung ailments in 1987 at the age of 89 in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. He was interred at Elmwood Cemetery in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DC1E30F930A35750C0A961948260 "Randolph Scott is dead at 89; Laconic cowboy-film actor."] ''The New York Times,'' March 3, 1987.</ref><ref>{{Find a Grave|3037}}</ref>

===Marriages===
Scott married twice. In 1936, he became the second husband of heiress [[Marion duPont Scott|Marion duPont]], daughter of William Du Pont, Sr., and great-granddaughter of Éleuthère Irénée Du Pont de Nemours, the founder of the [[E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]]. Marion had previously married George Somerville, with Scott serving as best man at the wedding; the marriage ended in divorce three years later.

===Rumors about sexual orientation===
[[File:Randolph Scott and Cary Grant.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Randolph Scott and [[Cary Grant]]<br />"Bachelor Hall" photo</center>]]
Although Scott achieved fame as a motion picture actor, he managed to keep a fairly low profile with his private life. Offscreen he was good friends with [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Cary Grant]]. He met Grant on the set of ''[[Hot Saturday]]'' (1932), where they shared only one scene together, and shortly afterwards they began rooming together in a beach house in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] that became known as "Bachelor Hall".  According to author Robert Nott, "They lived together on and off for about ten years, because they were friends and wanted to save on living expenses (they were both considered to be notorious tightwads)."<ref name="Nott p. 11"/> In 1944, Scott and Grant stopped living together but remained close friends throughout their lives.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lyMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dmcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4944,6993051&dq=randolph+scott+batch&hl=en Durable, Wealthy Randolph Scott Manages Fortune] Sarasota Herald Tribune Jul 31 1978</ref> This has led to unsubstantiated gossip that the two were a homosexual couple.  Scott's adopted son, Christopher, challenged the rumors. Following Scott's death, Christopher wrote a book entitled, ''Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?'', in which he rebuts rumors of his father's alleged homosexuality. The widely circulated photos of Grant & Scott were publicity stills, and the poses were at the direction of the studio publicists, to be used for an upcoming film. They were stolen from the Scott family house during the last month's of his father's life by a nurse who had been fired. <ref>Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?" by C.H. Scott, Empire Publishing, 1994, Chapter 6.</ref>  [[Budd Boetticher]], who directed Scott in seven films from 1956 to 1960, had this to say about the rumors: "Bullshit".<ref name="Nott p. 11">Nott 2005, p. 11.</ref>  Grant's assertion that he had "nothing against gays, I'm just not one myself", is treated at length in [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s book of essays about actors, ''Who the Hell's in It''.

==Cultural references==
Scott is the putative subject of the 1974 [[Statler Brothers]] song "Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott?", lamenting the passing of Western films.

He is mentioned in the film ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' when Sheriff Bart tries to convince the reluctant citizens of Rock Ridge to support his plan to save the town. He says that they "would do it for Randolph Scott" and they rise, putting their hands to their hearts and saying reverently "Randolph Scott", echoed by an off-screen chorus, and agree to help the sheriff. This scene happens 1 hour 9 minutes and 46 seconds into the movie.

Scott and ''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]'' are referred to in [[Tom Lehrer]]'s song "Send the Marines".

Scott is the subject of guitarist [[Leo Kottke]]'s song "Turning into Randolph Scott (Humid Child)" on his 1994 album ''[[Peculiaroso]]''.

In [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s book, ''[[V.]]'', the character Profane watches an unspecified Randolph Scott film and compares himself unfavorably with his hero, whom he describes as "cool, imperturbable, keeping his trap shut and only talking when he had to – and then saying the right things and not running off haphazard and inefficient at the mouth".

==Awards==
In 1975, Scott was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], United States. He also received an In Memoriam [[Golden Boot Awards|Golden Boot Award]] for his work in Westerns.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Scott has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6243 Hollywood Blvd. In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>[http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf "1999"]. ''Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated''. Retrieved August 5, 2012.</ref>

==Politics==
Despite his southern background at a time when the region was solidly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] in political affiliation, Scott was an active [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. In [[U.S. presidential election, 1944|1944]], he attended the massive rally organized by [[David O. Selznick]] in the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] in support of the [[Thomas E. Dewey|Dewey]]-[[John W. Bricker|Bricker]] ticket as well as [[governor of California|Governor]] [[Earl Warren]] of California, who would become Dewey's running mate in 1948 and later the [[Chief Justice of the United States]]. The gathering drew 93,000, with [[Cecil B. DeMille]] as the [[master of ceremonies]] and short speeches by [[Hedda Hopper]] and [[Walt Disney]]. Among those in attendance were [[Ann Sothern]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], and [[Gary Cooper]]. Despite the good turnout at the rally, most Hollywood celebrities who took a public position sided with the [[Franklin Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]-[[Harry Truman|Truman]] ticket.<ref>David M.
