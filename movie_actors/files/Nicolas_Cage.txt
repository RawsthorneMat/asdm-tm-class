In November 2007, Cage was spotted backstage at a ''[[Ring of Honor]]'' wrestling show in New York City researching for the lead role for ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]''. However, Cage dropped out of production shortly afterwards because he felt he did not have enough time to prepare for the role and director [[Darren Aronofsky]] preferred [[Mickey Rourke]] for the lead part.

In an interview with slashfilm.com, Aronofsky said of Cage's decision to leave the film that: "Nic was a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but ... you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race.<ref name="slash" /> "

==Praise==
[[File:Nicholas Cage Walk of fame.jpg|thumb|Cage's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
Cage's acting has been praised by film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who wrote in his "Great Movies" essay, about the film ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]]'', that: "There are often lists of the great living male movie stars: [[Robert De Niro|De Niro]], [[Jack Nicholson|Nicholson]] and [[Al Pacino|Pacino]], usually. How often do you see the name of Nicolas Cage? He should always be up there. He's daring and fearless in his choice of roles, and unafraid to crawl out on a limb, saw it off and remain suspended in air. No one else can project inner trembling so effectively... he always seems so earnest. However improbable his character, he never winks at the audience. He is committed to the character with every atom and plays him as if he were him."<ref name="ebert" /> In response to mixed reviews of ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' and their focus on criticizing Cage, Ebert defended both Cage as an actor and the film which (in contrast to other critics) he gave four out of four stars.<ref name="ebert2" />

''Lord of War'' co-star [[Ethan Hawke]] said of Cage: "He's the only actor since [[Marlon Brando]] that's actually done anything new with the art of acting; he's successfully taken us away from an obsession with [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old [[troubadour]]s." While stating that Cage had hurt his career by working on too many poor projects ("he's put a little too much water in his beer"), Hawke added: "If I could erase his bottom half bad movies, and only keep his top half movies, he would blow everyone else out of the water."<ref name="hawkeama">{{cite web | url=http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fq1h6/i_am_ethan_hawke_amaa/cacojck?context=3 | title=I am Ethan Hawke - AMAA | work=Reddit | date=June 5, 2013 | accessdate=June 14, 2013 | author=Hawke, Ethan}}</ref>

At the [[68th Academy Awards|1996 Academy Awards]], Cage won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance in ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/aa95.html|title=1995 Academy Awards Winners and History|work=FilmSite.org|accessdate=August 18, 2010}}</ref> After receiving the award, he went on to star in some high budget action movies, which received criticism by actors such as [[Stephen Baldwin]], [[Nick Nolte]], and [[Sean Penn]], who said to the ''New York Times'' that Cage is "no longer an actor" and is "more like a performer".<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20127825,00.html ''People Magazine''.

==Personal life==

===Relationships and family===
In 1988, Cage began dating actress [[Christina Fulton]], who later bore their son, Weston Coppola Cage (born December 26, 1990). Weston was the lead singer of the [[black metal]] band Eyes of Noctum, but broke up in 2012; Arsh Anubis, his new band of the same genre, was formed in 2011. Weston also appeared in Cage's film ''[[Lord of War]]'' as Vladimir, a young [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] mechanic who quickly disarms a [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter. Weston and his wife Danielle have a son, Lucian Augustus Coppola Cage, born July 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicolas Cage's Son Weston Cage Welcomes Baby Boy Lucian Augustus With Wife Danielle|url=https://celebrity.yahoo.com/news/nicolas-cages-son-weston-cage-welcomes-baby-boy-171500882-us-weekly.html|publisher=Yahoo! News |accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>

Cage has been married three times. His first wife was actress [[Patricia Arquette]] (married in April 1995, divorce finalized in 2001).<ref>{{cite news|title=Nicolas Cage’s divorce from Patricia Arquette|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2001/08/30/nickcage/|accessdate=October 20, 2014|publisher=Hello magazine}}</ref>

Cage's second marriage was to singer/songwriter [[Lisa Marie Presley]], daughter of [[Elvis Presley]]. Cage is an Elvis fan and used the star as the base of his performance in ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]''. Presley and Cage married on August 10, 2002 and filed for divorce on November 25, 2002 which was finalized on May 16, 2004. The divorce proceeding was longer than the marriage.<ref name="silverman2004" />

Cage met his third and current wife Alice Kim, a former waitress who previously worked at the Los Angeles restaurant Kabuki and at the Los Angeles-based Korean nightclub, [[Le Prive|Le Privé]]. She bore their son, Kal-El, (after [[Superman]]'s birth name<ref name="bbc2005" />) on October 3, 2005. Cage was once considered for the role of Superman in a film to be directed by [[Tim Burton]]. Alice had a minor role in the 2007 film ''[[Next (2007 film)|Next]]'', which Cage produced. They were married at a private ranch in Northern California on July 30, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicolas Cage and Alice Kim Marriage Profile|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/celebritymarriages/p/nicolascage.htm|work=[[About.com]]|accessdate=October 14, 2012}}</ref>

===Political and religious views===
Cage grew up in a family of [[Catholic]] background but does not talk about religion publicly and refuses to answer religion-connected questions in his interviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=This much I know: Karen Koster|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/this-much-i-know-karen-koster-155089.html|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref> When asked about the movie ''[[Knowing (film)|Knowing]]'' being a religion-themed film or not, Cage replied: "Any of my personal beliefs or opinions runs the risk of impinging on your own relationship with the movie. I feel movies are best left enigmatic, left raising more questions than answers. I don't want to ever preach. So [whatever you get] from the movie [is] far more interesting than I could ever offer."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyjoe.com/2009/03/29/entertainment/nicolas-cage-talks-knowing-religion-video/ |title=Nicolas Cage talks "Knowing", religion |publisher=Everyjoe.com |date=March 29, 2009 |accessdate=May 14, 2014}}</ref>

During his visit to [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] he stated he is not a politically active actor and that he can do it in his work as he learned more about [[nuclear power]] from the movie ''[[The China Syndrome]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicolas Cage visits UCSC|url=http://www1.ucsc.edu/currents/02-03/05-26/cage.html|work=[[University of California, Santa Cruz]]|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref> Cage has donated about $5,000 to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] since 1994.<ref>[http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Nicolas_Cage.php Celebrity donations - Nicolas Cage]</ref>

===Real estate and tax problems===
Nicolas Cage is one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, earning $40 million in 2009 according to ''[[Forbes]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-cage-foreclosure8-2010apr08,0,2028352.story?track=rss |title=Foreclosure auction of Nicolas Cage's mansion is a flop |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 8, 2010 |author=Lauren Beale |accessdate=April 11, 2010 }}</ref>

Cage had a [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home where he and Kim lived, but sold the property in 2005 for $10&nbsp;million. In 2004 he bought a property on [[Paradise Island]], Bahamas. In May 2006, he bought a {{convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on}} island in the [[Exuma]] archipelago, some {{convert|85|mi|km}} southeast of [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and close to a similar island owned by [[Faith Hill]] and [[Tim McGraw]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Nicolas Cage Buys Private Island|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1195930,00.html|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=people magazine}}</ref>

He bought the medieval castle [[Schloss Neidstein]] in the [[Oberpfalz]] region in Germany in 2006 and sold it in 2009 for $2.5&nbsp;million. His grandmother was German, living in [[Cochem|Cochem an der Mosel]].<ref name="zeitung" />
[[Image:Neidstein Schloss1.jpg|thumb|Schloss Neidstein in [[Bavaria]] was owned by Cage between 2007 and 2009.]]
In August 2007, Cage purchased "Grey Craig", a {{convert|24000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} brick-and-stone country manor in [[Middletown, Rhode Island|Middletown]], Rhode Island. With an estate occupying {{convert|26|acre|m2}} the home has 12 bedrooms and 10 full bathrooms and overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. It borders the [[Norman Bird Sanctuary]] to the west. The sale ranked among the state of Rhode Island's most expensive residential purchases until eclipsed that same year, 2007, by the $17.15&nbsp;million sale of the Miramar mansion on Bellevue Avenue in Newport.<ref>{{cite web|title=Actor Nicolas Cage reportedly buys a 24,664-square-foot mansion in Middletown, Rhode Island for $15.7M|url=http://www.bergproperties.com/blog/actor-nicolas-cage-reportedly-buys-a-24664-square-foot-mansion-in-middletown-rhode-island-for-157m/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nicolas Cage Sells Gray Craig Estate – SOLD|url=http://www.priceypads.com/nicholas-cage-price-cuts-gray-craig-estate-7750000/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>

Also in 2007, the actor purchased [[Midford Castle]] in Somerset, England.<ref name="kingofcastle" /><ref name="hodgson" /><ref name="chittenden" /> Shortly after selling his German castle, Cage also put homes in [[Rhode Island]], [[Louisiana]], [[Nevada]], and California, as well as a $7 million island in the [[Bahamas]], up for sale.<ref>{{cite news|title=WHO IN HOLLYWOOD OWNS A PRIVATE ISLAND|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/private-islands-real-estate-johnny-depp-leonardo-dicaprio-353610|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=hollywoodreporter.com}}</ref>

On July 14, 2009, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] filed documents in New Orleans in connection with a [[tax lien|federal tax lien]] against property owned by Cage in Louisiana, concerning unpaid federal taxes. The IRS alleges that Cage failed to pay over $6.2 million in federal income tax for the year 2007.<ref name="houstonchronicle" /> In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has another lien for more than $350,000 in unpaid taxes dating from 2002 to 2004.<ref name="rodriguez" /> Cage filed a $20&nbsp;million lawsuit on October 16, 2009, against his business manager, Samuel J. Levin, alleging negligence and fraud.<ref name="ruin" /> The lawsuit states that Levin "had failed to pay taxes when they were due and had placed [Cage] in speculative and risky real estate investments 'resulting in (the actor) suffering catastrophic losses'."<ref name="ruin"/> Cage is also facing separate lawsuits from East West Bank<ref name="indiatimes" /> and Red Curb Investments for unpaid, multimillion dollar loans.
[[Image:1140 Royal Street.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three-storey rectangular building|The LaLaurie Mansion in [[New Orleans]] was purchased anonymously by Cage in 2007 and sold in 2009.]]
Samuel Levin filed a counter-complaint and responded to the lawsuit in a filing stating that he warned Cage that he was living beyond his means and urged him to spend less. Levin's filing states that "instead of listening to Levin, cross-defendant Cage (Coppola) spent most of his free time shopping for high ticket purchases, and wound up with 15 personal residences", Levin's complaint continued: "Likewise, Levin advised Coppola against buying a Gulfstream jet, against buying and owning a flotilla of yachts, against buying and owning a squadron of Rolls Royces, against buying millions of dollars in jewelry and art."<ref name="money.cnn.com" />

In his filing Levin says that in 2007 Cage's "shopping spree entailed the purchase of three additional residences at a total cost of more than $33 million; the purchase of 22 automobiles (including 9 Rolls Royces); 12 purchases of expensive jewelry; and 47 purchases of artwork and exotic items."<ref name="money.cnn.com"/> One of those exotic items was a dinosaur skull of a [[Tarbosaurus]] for which Nicolas Cage paid $276,000 in an auction after winning a bidding contest against [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].<ref name="skull" />

According to Cage, he owned the "Most Haunted House in America", a home located in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana.<ref name="letterman" /> Known as "The LaLaurie House" after its former owner [[Delphine LaLaurie]], the house was foreclosed and sold at auction on November 12, 2009 along with another New Orleans property for a total of $5.5 million, in the wake of Cage's financial problems.<ref name="foreclose">{{cite news |title=Nicolas Cage: Movie star, foreclosure victim |first=Hibah |last=Yousuf |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/11/13/real_estate/Nicolas_Cage/index.htm?cnn=yes |publisher=CNN |date=November 13, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2009}}</ref>

His [[Bel Air, Los Angeles|Bel Air]] home, which had six loans totaling $18&nbsp;million on it, failed to sell at an April 2010 foreclosure auction despite an opening offer of $10.4 million, substantially less than the $35&nbsp;million that Cage had originally tried to sell it for.

In November 2011, Cage also sold his [[Action Comics 1]] in an online auction for a record-breaking $2.16 million (the previous record being $1.5 million), to assist paying his tax liens and other debts. Cage purchased the comic in 1997 for $110,000.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/01/us/superman-comic/index.html?iref=allsearch | work=CNN | title=Super price for Superman comic - CNN.com | date=December 2, 2011}}</ref>

===Legal issues===
In December 2009, [[Christina Fulton]] sued Cage for $13&nbsp;million and for the house in which she was living. The suit was in response to an order that she leave the dwelling; the order resulted from Cage's financial difficulties.<ref name="freepress12D" />

On April 15, 2011, at 11:30&nbsp;pm, Cage was arrested in New Orleans' [[French Quarter]] district for suspicion of domestic abuse [[Battery (crime)|battery]], disturbing the peace and public intoxication, after a police officer was flagged down by onlookers after Cage allegedly grabbed his wife's upper arm while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/16/us-cage-arrest-idUSTRE73F24J20110416|title=Actor Nicolas Cage arrested in New Orleans|agency=Reuters | date=April 16, 2011}}</ref> Cage was held in police custody until a bail of $11,000 was posted by [[Duane "Dog" Chapman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/04/niccage.html?imw=Y&f=most-viewed-24h5|title=Nicolas Cage Arrested in New Orleans (Updated)|author=Mike Vilensky|publisher=Vulture}}</ref> He was later ordered to appear in court on May 31, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/42624176/ns/today-entertainment|title=Nicolas Cage arrested in New Orleans|publisher=MSN}}</ref> On May 5, 2011, it was announced that the charges against Cage had been dropped.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eugene Ernest|date=May 9, 2011|title=Court Cleared all Allegations on Nicolas Cage|url=http://www.mjbstar.com/celebrities/2011/05/09/court-cleared-all-allegations-on-nicolas-cage/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=May 6, 2011|title=Domestic Abuse Charges Against Nicolas Cage Dropped|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/05/06/domestic_abuse_charges_against_nicolas}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=May 6, 2011|title=Charges dropped against Nicolas Cage in New Orleans|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/story_print.html?id=4739763&sponsor=}}</ref>
