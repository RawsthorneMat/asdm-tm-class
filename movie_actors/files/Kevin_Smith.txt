==Career==

===As a filmmaker===
On his 21st birthday, Smith went to see [[Richard Linklater]]'s comedy ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]''. Smith, impressed by the fact that Linklater set and shot the film his hometown of [[Austin, Texas]] rather than on a sound stage in a major city, was inspired to become a filmmaker, and to set films where he lived.<ref name=Playboy/> Smith relates: "It was the movie that got me off my ass; it was the movie that lit a fire under me, the movie that made me think, "Hey, I could be a filmmaker." And I had never seen a movie like that before ever in my life.<ref>Smith, Kevin. Interview by Robert K. Elder. ''The Film That Changed My Life.'' By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p 236. Print.</ref>

Smith attended the [[Vancouver Film School]] for four months, where he met long time collaborators [[Scott Mosier]] and [[Dave Klein (cinematographer)|Dave Klein]] but left halfway through the course in order to save money to make his first film.<ref>[http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/exclusive-film-school-rejects-kevin-smith-interview-colea.php/5 EXCLUSIVE: WE SHOOT THE SH*T WITH KEVIN SMITH]</ref>

[[NJ.com]].</ref> and decided to set his film, ''[[Clerks]]'', at the store, borrowing the life-in-a-day structure from the [[Spike Lee]] film ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''. To finance the film, Smith maxed out more than a dozen credit cards and sold his much-treasured comic book collection, raising the $27,575 needed to make the film. He cast friends and acquaintances in the film's major parts. ''Clerks'' was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1994, where it won the Filmmaker's Trophy. At a restaurant following the screening, [[Miramax]] executive [[Harvey Weinstein]] invited Smith to join him at his table, where he offered to buy the movie. In May 1994, it went to the [[Cannes International Film Festival]], where it won both the Prix de la Jeunesse and the International Critics' Week Prize. Released in October 1994 in two cities, the film went on to play in 50 markets, never playing on more than fifty screens at any given time. Despite the limited release, it was a critical and financial success, earning $3.1&nbsp;million.<ref name=Playboy/><ref>{{cite news|title=Register Dogs|author=Smith, Chris|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8-MCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=register+dogs+clerks+kevin+smith&source=bl&ots=FRtXRs5qtD&sig=Eal4Vyp9rO7MvC9xyRi_dHgHARE&hl=en&ei=41sxTbDuIo74sAPV2PznBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]/[[Google Books]]|date=October 24, 1994}}</ref> Initially, the film received an [[NC-17]] rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], solely for the sexually graphic language.

Smith's second film, ''[[Mallrats]]'', which marked [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]'s debut as a leading man, did not fare as well as expected after the remarkable success of ''Clerks''.

Smith's fourth film, ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', featured an all-star cast and found itself mired in controversy. The religious-themed 1999 comedy, which starred a post-''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' Ben Affleck and [[Matt Damon]], as well as [[Chris Rock]], [[Salma Hayek]], [[George Carlin]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Linda Fiorentino]], and Smith regulars Jason Lee and [[Jason Mewes]], raised criticism by the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]].<ref>Givens, Ron.

Smith then focused the spotlight on two characters who had appeared in supporting roles in his previous four films, ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' featured an all-star cast, with many familiar faces returning from Smith's first four films. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon appear as themselves filming a mock sequel to ''Good Will Hunting''. The $20&nbsp;million film earned $30&nbsp;million at the box office and received mixed reviews from the critics.

''[[Jersey Girl (2004 film)|Jersey Girl]]'' with Ben Affleck, [[Liv Tyler]], George Carlin and [[Raquel Castro]], his first outside of the View Askewniverse, was meant to mark a new direction in Smith's career. However, the film took a critical beating<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jersey_girl/ "Jersey Girl (2004)"]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

In the 2006 sequel, ''[[Clerks II]]'', Smith revisited the Dante and Randal characters from his first film for what was his final visit to the View Askewniverse.

On March 12, 2015 Smith revealed he would film ''[[Clerks III]]'' in May 2015. Then in February to March 2016, he will direct ''Moose Jaws'' and ''Anti-Claus'' and even alluded to a ''Mallrats'' sequel,<ref>Wales, George (March 12, 2015) [http://www.gamesradar.com/kevin-smith-working-mallrats-sequel/ "Is Kevin Smith working on a Mallrats sequel?"].

On April 8, 2015, Smith confirmed that ''[[Mallrats 2]]'' would be his next film and not ''Clerks III'' like original intended. Smith said "we were talking about initially shooting ‘Clerks III’ this summer and then we were going to get to ‘Mallrats’ in the beginning of 2016. And then it jumped into 2015, where we were going to shoot ‘Clerk’s and then hopefully ‘Mallrats’ before the end of the year. But now, based on a f—ing mall that we all dig that will be going away, the priority has become ‘Mallrats.’ So the next f—ing movie I’m making is ‘Mallrats 2.’ A majority of the cast from the original film have signed on to appear in the sequel with sixteen of eighteen confirmed.<ref>Melrose, Kevin (April 8, 2015).[http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2015/04/08/mallrats-2-will-be-kevin-smiths-next-film/ "'Mallrats 2'" Will Be Kevin Smith's Next Film].

===Writer===
In 1996, Smith worked on a script for [[Superman film series#Superman Lives|a Superman movie]]. He did a couple of drafts but his script was dropped when [[Tim Burton]] was hired to direct. Burton brought his own people in to work on the project. Smith still sees the whole experience on working on the Superman project as a positive one, however; he has said that he was well paid and it was a lot of fun. In April, 2009, Smith discussed his ''Superman'' experiences] at Clark University—a [[YouTube]] video that critic [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called "extraordinary".<ref>Doctorow, Cory (April 27, 2009). [http://boingboing.net/2009/04/27/kevin-smith-explains.html "Kevin Smith explains what happened to his Superman movie"]. [[Boing Boing]].</ref><ref>[[Scott, A.O.]] (September 22, 2011). [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/movies/kevin-smiths-red-state-review.html?_r=0 "Director Hates Stupidity, Hypocrisy and Critics "Kevin Smith's 'Red State'"]. ''The New York Times''.</ref>) In the end, neither Smith's nor Burton's vision for Superman was filmed. In the 2007 Direct-to-DVD animation release of ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'', Smith has a cameo as an onlooker in a crowd. After Superman defeats [[Toyman (comics)|The Toyman]]'s giant mechanical robot, Smith scoffs, "Yeah, like we really needed him to defeat that giant spider. Heh. ''Lame!''" This was a reference to a giant spider that producer [[Jon Peters]] wanted Smith to put in the film when he was attached, that was later put into the 1999 feature film flop ''[[Wild Wild West]]'', which Peters also produced.

In 1997, Smith was hired by [[New Line]] to rewrite ''[[Overnight Delivery]]'', which was expected to be a blockbuster teen movie. Smith's then-girlfriend [[Joey Lauren Adams]] almost took the role of Ivy in the movie, instead of the female lead in ''[[Chasing Amy]]''. Eventually she lost out to [[Reese Witherspoon]], and ''Overnight Delivery'' was quietly released directly to video in April 1998. Kevin Smith's involvement with the film was revealed on-line, but he remains uncredited. He has said that the only scene which really used his dialogue was the opening scene, which includes a reference to long-time Smith friend [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]].<ref name="greasy">{{cite web|url=http://www.viewaskew.com/press/psycomic/5.html|title=The Unholy Tale of Greasy Reese Witherspoon|work="Developing the Monkey" [originally] on Psycomic.com|publisher=ViewAskew.com|date=December 1, 2000|accessdate=June 13, 2008}}</ref>

In 2004, Smith wrote a screenplay for a new film version of ''[[The Green Hornet]]'', and announced prematurely that he had originally intended to direct as well.<ref>[http://www.viewaskew.com/news/feb04/1.html 'Hornet' buzzes Smith] News Askew. Retrieved November 29, 2008.</ref> The project, however died after the film was placed into turn around following the poor box office of ''[[Jersey Girl (2004 film)|Jersey Girl]]''.

===Comics and magazines===
Smith has been a regular contributor to ''[[Arena (magazine)|Arena]]'' magazine. In 2005, [[Miramax Books]] released Smith's first book, ''[[Silent Bob Speaks]]'', a collection of previously published essays (most from ''Arena'') dissecting pop culture, the movie business, and Smith's personal life. His second book, ''My Boring-Ass Life: The Uncomfortably Candid Diary of Kevin Smith'', published by [[Titan Books]], was another collection of previously published essays (this time blogs from Smith's website www.silentbobspeaks.com) and reached No. 32 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' Best Sellers List.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viewaskew.com/news/oct07/1.html |title=Kevin finishes writing "Red State" |work=The New York Times|publisher=The View Askewniverse |accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref> Titan released Smith's third book ''Shootin' the Sh*t with Kevin Smith: The Best of the SModcast'' on September 29, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1845764153 |title=Shootin' the Sh*t with Kevin Smith: The Best of the SModcast (9781845764159): Kevin Smith: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref>

[[Image:KevinSmithCC08.jpg|thumb|Smith at the 2008 [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] convention]]
A lifelong comic book fan, Smith's early forays into comic books dealt with previously established View Askew characters, and were published by [[Oni Press]]. He wrote a short [[Jay and Silent Bob]] story about Walt Flanagan's dog in ''Oni Double Feature'' No. 1, and followed it with a [[Bluntman and Chronic]] story in ''Oni Double Feature'' #12. He followed these with a series of [[Clerks (comic)|''Clerks'' comics]]. The first was simply ''Clerks: The Comic Book'', which told of Randal's attempts to corner the market on ''Star Wars'' toys. The second was ''Clerks: Holiday Special'', where Dante and Randal discover that Santa Claus lives in an apartment between the Quick Stop and RST Video. Third was ''Clerks: The Lost Scene'', showing what happened inside Poston's Funeral Parlor. This story was later animated in the TV series style and included as an extra on the 10th Anniversary ''[[Clerks]]'' DVD.

Smith then wrote the mini-series ''[[Chasing Dogma]]'', which tells the story of Jay and Silent Bob between the films ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' and ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. He has also written the trade paperback ''[[Bluntman and Chronic]]'', published by [[Image Comics|Image]], which purports to be a collection of the three issues of the series done by Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards (of ''Chasing Amy''). It includes a color reprinting of the story from ''Oni Double Feature'' No. 12, purported to be an early appearance by ''Chasing Amy'' characters Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards. These stories have all been collected in ''Tales From the Clerks'' (Graphitti Designs, ISBN 0-936211-78-4), which also includes a new "Clerks" story tying into the ''Clerks 2'' material, and the story from ''Oni Double Feature'' #1. They were previously collected by Image Comics in three separate volumes, one each for ''Clerks'', ''Chasing Dogma'' and ''Bluntman and Chronic''. In 1999, Smith won a [[Harvey Award]], for Best New Talent in comic books.<ref>[http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/harvey99.php "1999 Harvey Award Nominees and Winners"], Comic Book Awards Almanac, accessed March 7, 2011.</ref>

In 1999, Smith wrote "[[Daredevil: Guardian Devil|Guardian Devil]]", an eight-issue story arc of ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' for [[Marvel Comics]], which was illustrated by [[Joe Quesada]]. Kevin Smith followed this by producing a 15-issue tenure on ''[[Green Arrow]]'' for [[DC Comics]] that saw the return of [[Oliver Queen]] from the dead and the introduction of [[Mia Dearden]], a teenage girl who would become Speedy after Smith's run had ended.

Smith returned to Marvel for two mini-series: ''[[Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do]]'' and ''[[Daredevil/Bullseye: The Target]]'', both of which debuted in 2002. The former was six issues long, but after the third issue was published two months after the initially scheduled release date, the final issues were delayed for at least three years, prompting Marvel to release an "in case you missed it" reprinting of the first three issues as one book prior to the remaining issues' release. The delay in part was due to Smith's movie production schedule (in this case, work on ''Jersey Girl'' and ''Clerks II'') causing him to shelve completion of the mini-series until the films were completed. He was announced as the writer of an ongoing ''[[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]'' series<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0202/24/|title=''Kevin Smith Talks Black Cat''.|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref> and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=13&t=001042|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020601183702/http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=13&t=001042|archivedate=June 1, 2002|title=''Marvel Locks Up JMS/Kevin Smith.''|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=1129|title=Wednesday Marvel Conference Call Wrap Up.''|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=March 28, 2007}}</ref> in early to mid-2002. However, because of the delays on ''Evil That Men Do'' and ''The Target'', the plan was switched so that Smith would start a third Spider-Man title,<ref>Couper, Jonathan. [http://www.comicboards.com/smb/view.php?rpl=030106020056 ''Re: Kevin Smith Question – Reasons...''] Accessdate: March 28, 2007.</ref> launched in 2004 by [[Mark Millar]] instead. While ''Spider-Man/Black Cat'' was ultimately completed in 2005, ''Daredevil/Bullseye: The Target'' remains unfinished, with one issue published.

Smith wrote the limited series ''[[Batman: Cacophony]]'', with art by friend [[Walt Flanagan]], which ran from November 2008 to January 2009. The series featured the villains [[Onomatopoeia (comics)|Onomatopoeia]] (a character created by Smith during his run at Green Arrow), [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]], [[Maxie Zeus]], and [[Victor Zsasz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/893/893741p1.html |title=SDCC 08: Kevin Smith Tackles New Batman Series |publisher=IGN|first=Richard |last=George|date= July 24, 2008|accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref> The [[trade paperback]] of ''Batman: Cacophony'' became a [[New York Times Bestseller]] in their Hardcover Graphic Books section.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/books/bestseller/bestgraphicbooks.html | work=The New York Times | title=Graphic Books | date=October 18, 2009|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}</ref>

In 2010 Smith subsequently wrote a six-issue [[Batman]] mini-series called ''[[Batman: The Widening Gyre|The Widening Gyre]]'' for DC drawn by Walter Flanigan. The series was initially planned as 12 issues, with a long break planned between issues six and seven. After issue six was published, Smith and Flanigan's work on their reality show, ''[[Comic Book Men]]'', extended this planned break further than expected. It was decided in the interim to release the remaining issues as a separate series to be called ''[[Batman: Bellicosity]]'', due in 2014.<ref name="smodcast1">{{cite web|url=http://smodcast.com/episodes/the-comic-book-men-go-bat-shit-live/ |title=The Comic Book Men Go Bat-Shit LIVE! |publisher=SModcast |date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://batwatch.net/news/2013/6/18/kevin-smith-talks-new-project-batman-bellicosity |title=Kevin Smith Talks New Project, Batman Bellicosity |publisher=Batwatch.net |date=June 18, 2013 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/rorschachsrants/news/?a=69072 |title=COMICS: Kevin Smith Announces BATMAN: BELLICOSITY |publisher=Comicbookmovie.com |date=October 22, 2012 |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>

Also in 2010 Smith published a [[The Green Hornet|Green Hornet]] story for [[Dynamite Entertainment]], which was based on an unused script he wrote for a ''Green Hornet'' film project that never came to fruition.<ref name=PopEWGH/><ref>Smith, Kevin.

In August 2011, Dynamite Entertainment debuted ''[[The Bionic Man]]'' by Smith, which was based on a 1998 script he wrote that was rejected by Universal as being "more like a comic book than a movie."<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?id=32295&page=article "Kevin Smith's 'Bionic Man' Debuts at Dynamite"]. Comic Book Resources. May 12, 2011</ref>

In 2014 it was announced Smith and [[Ralph Garman]] are working on a [[Batman (TV series)#Batman .2766|Batman '66]] crossover featuring Batman and Green Hornet titled ''Batman 66 meets the Green Hornet''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?feature=g-subs-u&v=igRaLciDl1I|title=Kevin Smith & Ralph Garman Announce New Batman/Green Hornet Project - (DCAA 206)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref>

In 1998, Smith shot two TV commercials for [[Coca Cola]], which he filmed in New Jersey.<ref name=Playboy/>

In 2000, Smith and Mosier teamed up with television writer [[David Mandel]] to develop an animated television show based on ''Clerks.'' called ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'' that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in May 2000. It aired only two episodes before being canceled as a result of poor ratings. The six produced episodes were released on DVD in 2001.

During the mid-1990s Smith directed and starred in a series of commercials for MTV, alongside [[Jason Mewes]], in which they reprised their roles as [[Jay and Silent Bob]]. In 1998 he directed best friend Jason Mewes as "Gary Lamb – Ground Activist" in a series of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] commercials. That same year, he also shot commercials for Diet Coke. Two years later, he directed "Star Wars" toy commercials for Hasbro. He has also directed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viewaskew.com/tv/panasonic/index.html |title=Kevin's Panasonic e-Wear Commercials |publisher=The View Askewniverse |accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref> and starred<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viewaskew.com/tv/panasonic/dvdr.html |title=Kevin Smith – Cultural Historian |publisher=The View Askewniverse |accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref> in commercials for [[Panasonic]].

===Acting roles and other appearances===
As an actor, Smith is known for his role as [[Jay and Silent Bob|Silent Bob]] in ''[[Clerks]]'', ''[[Mallrats]]'', ''[[Chasing Amy]]'', ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', ''[[Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', and ''[[Clerks II]]''. He made a cameo appearance in the horror film ''[[Scream 3]]'', and was featured along with [[Jason Mewes]] in several ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation]]'' episodes, including a special, "Jay and Silent Bob Do Degrassi" (also as a fictional version of himself).

Smith also appeared in an [[mtvU]] show titled ''[[Sucks Less With Kevin Smith]]''. The show gives college students ideas for things to do on the weekends. Smith also played the role of Paul, a cynical divorced man, in a [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television series pilot, "Manchild", filmed in December 2006. However, it was not picked up by the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/?p=4591 |title=SModcast 11 |publisher=Quickstopentertainment.com |accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref>

From 1995 to 1997, Smith played small roles in the View Askew movies ''[[Drawing Flies]]'', ''[[Vulgar (film)|Vulgar]]'', and ''[[Big Helium Dog]]''.

In 2001, he appeared in friend Jeff Anderson's ''[[Now You Know (film)|Now You Know]]''. After an August 2001 appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' to promote ''Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back'', Smith returned to the show for monthly segments as a correspondent. The "Roadside Attractions" segments featured Smith traveling to random locations around the country and showcased places like [[Howe Caverns]] in upstate New York and the Fish Market in [[Seattle]]. While five of these segments were included on the ''[[Jersey Girl (2004 film)|Jersey Girl]]'' DVD, at least twelve were aired on the actual show. Smith regularly appeared on the program to introduce the pre-taped pieces.

In 2003, Smith appeared in a cameo role as coroner [[Jack Kirby]] in the film ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]''. In 2006, he voiced the Moose in the CGI cartoon ''[[Doogal]]''.

In early 2005, [[Degrassi: The Next Generation#Guest roles|Smith appeared in three episodes]] of the Canadian-made teen drama ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation]]''. In the episodes, Smith, portraying a fictionalized version of himself, visited the school to work on the (fictional) film ''Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh!'' Smith wrote all his dialogue for the shows he appeared in. All three episodes were collected on a DVD entitled ''Jay and Silent Bob Do Degrassi''. Smith and Mewes also appeared in two more episodes the following season, when they returned to Degrassi for the Toronto premiere of the fictional ''Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh!'' movie.

In 2006, Smith guest reviewed on ''[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper|Ebert & Roeper]]'', in place of [[Roger Ebert]], who was recovering from [[thyroid cancer]] treatment. These spots have been notable for the arguments between Smith and [[Richard Roeper]] over certain films, with Smith often citing Roeper's negative review of ''Jersey Girl'' to discredit his review of the film at hand. On one appearance, Smith compared [[Craig Brewer]]'s ''[[Black Snake Moan (film)|Black Snake Moan]]'' to the works of [[William Faulkner]].

In addition to appearing on ''Degrassi: The Next Generation'', Smith is an avid fan of the original ''[[Degrassi (franchise)|Degrassi]]'' series, ''[[Degrassi Junior High]]'' and ''[[Degrassi High]]'' and references to the original are present in some of his early films. He also appeared in the 2009 made for TV movie [[Degrassi Goes Hollywood]].

Smith was featured as one of the interview subjects in ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'', a 2006 documentary about the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s process of rating films. Smith discussed how ''[[Jersey Girl (2004 film)|Jersey Girl]]'' receiving an R rating, on the basis of a conversation two characters in that film have about masturbation, which MPAA head [[Joan Graves]] told Smith she wouldn't feel comfortable having her 16-year-old daughter watching. Smith's response was to question whether Graves' daughter hadn't already masturbated or learned about masturbation, arguing that his film was not teaching 16-year-olds anything they did not already know.<ref>''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]''. Director: [[Kirby Dick]]. 2006. [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]].</ref>

Smith directed the pilot for [[The CW]] show ''[[Reaper (TV Series)|Reaper]]''. TV.com's summary of the show is "A twenty-something slacker finally scores a job as [[the devil]]'s [[bounty hunter]]." He describes it as "less ''[[Brimstone (TV series)|Brimstone]]'' or ''[[Dead Like Me]]'' and more like ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' than anything else". He went on to say that the reason he took the job was that he has always wanted to direct something he did not write, but never had an interest in doing it on the big screen.

At the 2007 [[Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]], it was announced that Smith would write and direct an episode of the ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'' spin-off, ''[[Heroes: Origins]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=342|title=The Guy Who Ruined "Heroes" |publisher=My Boring Ass Life |first=Kevin |last=Smith |date=July 30, 2007 |accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref> but the project was canceled because of the [[2007 Writers Guild of America strike]]. That year, Smith appeared in a number of films. He co-starred as Sam in the film ''[[Catch and Release (film)|Catch and Release]]'', starring [[Jennifer Garner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=303 |title=Gimme an Oscar, Dammit! |publisher=Silentbobspeaks.com |accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref> Later that year, he appeared as a hacker called The Warlock in the fourth installment of the [[Die Hard]] franchise, ''[[Live Free or Die Hard]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=334 |title=Live Free or Die Hard Opens Today |publisher=My Boring Ass Life |accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref> At year's end, he appeared briefly in friend and fellow writer-director [[Richard Kelly (director)|Richard Kelly's]] ''[[Southland Tales]]'', in which he played the legless conspiracy theorist General Simon Theory. That same year, Smith also did voicework for the CGI film ''[[TMNT (film)|TMNT]]'' as a diner chef. He was also seen as Rusty (a friend of lead Jason Mewes) in ''[[Bottoms Up (2006 film)|Bottoms Up]]'' with co-star Paris Hilton.

Smith has also cameoed in the [[Joey and the Big Break (Part I & II)|second season premiere]] of the sitcom ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', where he played himself, on an episode of ''[[Law & Order]]'' in 2000 (episode "Black, White and Blue"), ''[[Duck Dodgers]]'' (2003 as [[Hal Jordan]], voice only) and ''[[Yes, Dear]]'' (2004, as himself and Silent Bob). Smith appeared in the second episode of season two of ''[[Driver Ed (Veronica Mars)|Veronica Mars]]'', playing a store clerk. He stated on his Web site that ''Veronica Mars'' is some of the best television work ever produced.<ref>{{cite web|title=My Boring-Ass Life: Kevin Smith's Online Diary|url=http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=160 |last=Smith|first=Kevin|publisher=silentbobspeaks.com (via Internet Archive)|date=September 3, 2005|accessdate=October 20, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060508054854/http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=160 |archivedate = May 8, 2006}}</ref> Additionally, he appeared as Silent Bob in an episode of ''[[Yes, Dear]]'', standing while smoking a cigarette as the end credits rolled.

Smith has appeared in five Q&A documentaries: ''[[An Evening with Kevin Smith]]'', ''[[An Evening with Kevin Smith 2: Evening Harder]]'' and ''[[Sold Out: A Threevening with Kevin Smith]]''. The fourth installment, ''[[Kevin Smith: Too Fat for 40]]'' was broadcast on [[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]] on October 23, 2010. The fifth Q&A, ''[[Kevin Smith: Burn in Hell]]'' also broadcast on Epix beginning February 11, 2012.  The first is a collection of filmed appearances at American colleges, while the sequel was shot at two Q&A shows held in [[Toronto]] and London. The third and fourth were filmed in Red Bank, New Jersey at the Count Basie Theater on Smith's 37th and 40th birthdays, respectively. The fifth was filmed in Austin, Texas at the Paramount Theater. The first two DVD sets were released by Sony Home Video, while the third was put out by the Weinstein Company. Smith appears with Marvel Comics guru [[Stan Lee]] in ''Marvel Then & Now: An Evening With Stan Lee and Joe Quesada, hosted by Kevin Smith''. The film is similar in tone to the ''Evening with Kevin Smith'' series. Proceeds from the sale of the film benefit [[The Hero Initiative]], a charitable organization that aids ill or aging comic book creators.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.thenandnowdvd.org |title = Then and Now DVD |accessdate =January 17, 2008}}</ref>

===Public appearances===
[[File:Kevin Smith by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Smith speaking at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].]]
Smith's longest Q&A session took place April 2, 2005, at the [[Count Basie Theatre]] in [[Red Bank, New Jersey|Red Bank]], New Jersey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsaskew.com/2005/04/03/madness-in-red-bank-kev-packs-the-basie/ |title=Madness In Red Bank: Kev Packs The Basie! |publisher=News Askew |author=Brad |date=April 3, 2005 |accessdate=November 9, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080801065135/http://www.newsaskew.com/2005/04/03/madness-in-red-bank-kev-packs-the-basie/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = August 1, 2008}}</ref> The sold-out event was over seven hours long, took place from 8&nbsp;pm through 3&nbsp;am (which due to [[daylight saving time]], was actually 4&nbsp;am). Following the Q&A, he opened [[Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash]] for a meet-and-greet with the numerous remaining audience members, which ended around 6:30&nbsp;am. Smith then hopped on a plane and did another Q&A at the Raue Center For The Arts in [[Crystal Lake, Illinois|Crystal Lake]], Illinois, that night. Planned for two hours, it lasted just over five hours, ending a little after 1&nbsp;am Central time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsaskew.com/cgi-bin/coranto/iSay.cgi?Page=Comments&ID=EEEkVVZEEAyrVjcdhf |title=NewsAskew Talk Back! |publisher=Newsaskew.com |accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref>

===On the Internet===
Smith has a website, The View Askewniverse, which opened in late 1995. He also has an online blog, "My Boring-Ass Life", the contents of which were published in a book by the same name. ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'''s fictional website MoviePoopShoot.com became real in 2002. It became [[Quick Stop Entertainment]] and was the home of SModcast until it was sold and SModcast moved to a dedicated website [[SModcast.com]], which also carries the other SModcast network [[podcast]]s in early 2010.

On February 5, 2007, Smith and [[Scott Mosier]] began [[SModcast]], a regular comedy podcast. SModcast has since spawned into a podcast network called the SModcast podcast network which began in 2010, its own [[digital radio]] station called SModcast Internet Radio (S.I.R) in 2011 and an internet television channel SModCo Internet Television (S.I.T.) in 2012.

On June 4, 2012, Smith premiered his [[Hulu]]-exclusive weekly series ''[[Spoilers (Hulu series)|Spoilers]]'', described as an "anti-movie review" series, where Smith takes a group of people to a new movie and has them comment on what they've seen. Other segments on the show include interviews with celebrities, and the "Criterion Lounge", where Smith discusses a [[Criterion Collection]] movie available on DVD and the Hulu Plus service.<ref>[http://www.hulu.com/spoilers ''Spoilers''].

==Secret Stash==
[[File:7.9.12SecretStashByLuigiNovi1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash]] in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]].]]
Smith owns and operates [[Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash]] in [[Red Bank, New Jersey|Red Bank]], New Jersey, a comic book store largely dedicated to merchandise related to his films and comics. He purchased the original store in January 1997 for $30,000 [[USD]], using the money he earned from ''Clerks''.<ref name=Playboy/> The current location is its second. The store was moved to a defunct ice cream parlor on Broad St. after Smith sold the Monmouth St. property. The New Jersey location is managed by Smith's long-time friend [[Walt Flanagan]], who appears frequently in Smith's films. A second Secret Stash in the Westwood section of Los Angeles was opened in September 2004 and was managed by long-time associate Bryan Johnson, who has appeared in Smith's films as Steve-Dave.<ref name="stash">Smith, Kevin (September 12, 2007).

==Controversies==
{{undue|date=September 2013}}

===2010 Southwest Airlines incident===
{{side_box|text="What's the safety issue? . . . Am I going to explode, is that it, am I [[Mr Creosote|the dude in Monty Python]]?"<ref name="Smodcast 106">Smodcast 106</ref>|position=right}}

On February 13, 2010, Kevin Smith was on board a full [[Southwest Airlines]] flight in Oakland bound for Burbank when he was asked to leave the plane, allegedly over their safety policy, which specifies space allocation and an armrests-must-be-down rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox40.com/news/headlines/ktxl-news-silentbob0214,0,579696.story |title="Silent Bob" Thrown Off Southwest Flight For Being Too Large |publisher=Fox40.com |date=February 14, 2010 |accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref> According to Smith, he was able to put both armrests down in accordance with Southwest Airlines policy, and both passengers on either side did not object to his presence. There was also another passenger larger than Smith on the same plane (although Smith did not comment on this at the time, saying he didn't want to "Throw a fellow fatty under the bus"<ref name="Smodcast 106"/>). Smith agreed to leave the flight after the employee told him the captain wanted him to leave. Smith was insulted by what he felt was humiliating treatment. After they exited the plane, he argued with the employee, trying to get a clear explanation for what had happened and who was responsible. He doubted that the captain had anything to do with the situation, and speculated it may have been one of the employees between the gate and the plane.<ref name="Smodcast 106"/> After being booked on a later flight and being offered a $100 Southwest Airlines voucher, which he turned down, Smith lashed out at Southwest Airlines on his Twitter account, holding the organization responsible for the actions of the employees in question.<ref name="Smodcast 106"/>

{{side_box|text="Is my dignity worth a hundred dollar voucher?"<ref name="Smodcast 106"/>|position=right}}

Another Southwest employee later found Smith, apologized to him and admitted he was treated wrongly.<ref name="Smodcast 106"/> Southwest Airlines representatives later released two statements regarding the incident via their blog.<ref>{{cite web|author=McNeill, Christi|url=http://www.blogsouthwest.com/blog/not-so-silent-bob |title=Not So Silent Bob |publisher=Nuts About Southwest|date=February 14, 2010|accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref> In the first statement, Southwest claimed that Smith "has been known to (...) purchase two Southwest seats" and cited its "Customer of Size" policy which requires that customers who cannot put their armrests down purchase two seats. In his podcast, Smith stated that he regularly purchased two seats, and had done so the previous week, because he preferred not having to sit next to anyone, not due to his size. In releasing this statement, Southwest disclosed Smith's personal travel details without his permission. The first statement also claimed that the flight captain personally determined that Smith was too large to fly. In its second statement, Southwest contradicted this claim, stating that the captain had not singled out Smith.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rutherford |first=Linda |url=http://www.blogsouthwest.com/blog/my-conversation-with-kevin-smith-0 |title=Blog &#124; Nuts About Southwest |publisher=Blogsouthwest.com |date=February 22, 1999 |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref>

Smith later released an entire episode of [[SModcast]] devoted to the subject, giving a lengthy description of the incident, in which he claimed that he had been able to lower the armrests completely and comfortably and claimed to have been repeatedly lied to by airline personnel. He also referred to the airline as the "[[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] of the Air" and vowed to never fly the airline again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smodcast.com/smods/smodcast106.html |title=SModcast 106: Fuck Southwest Airlines |publisher=Smodcast.com |accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref>

In his podcast, Smith stated that on his return flight a large female passenger was told to ask him if it was all right that she was sitting next to an empty seat he had bought between them, and it was suggested by Southwest staffers that she may need to purchase an additional seat due to her size, even though she had been placed next to an already-purchased empty seat. Smith interviewed her on the following SModcast episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smodcast.com/smods/smodcast107.html |title=SModcast 107: Thinicism |publisher=Smodcast.com |accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref>

Smith also released 24 video statements on YouTube further describing the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=SModcaster#p/u |title=SModcaster|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
After the success of his first films, Smith lived in [[Los Angeles]], though he disliked no longer being near his [[New Jersey]] friends. He dated actress [[Joey Lauren Adams]], and declared his desire to marry her in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, but they began to grow apart after he spoke of staying in Los Angeles permanently and starting a life with her. When Smith's grandmother became ill, he returned to Red Bank and remained there, realizing that that was where he belonged. Smith and Adams' relationship was tested by their working together on ''Chasing Amy'', the set of which saw a heated argument between the two. The two broke up in June 1997.<ref name=Playboy/>

[[File:Kevin Smith and Jennifer Schwalbach in 2011.jpg|thumb|Kevin Smith and [[Jennifer Schwalbach Smith]] in 2011]]

''[[New York Post]]''.</ref>

Initially raised Catholic, Smith began to develop doubts about his beliefs in his early 20s, and came to see Catholic mass as "dry and lip-servicey." Seeking out advice, Smith spoke to a priest, who analogized faith to liquid filling a shot glass, and explained that the glass grows in size as a person grows older, and thus the same knowledge that satisfies a person as a child can be insufficient as an adult. Smith read extensively on Christianity, explored other religions, read the [[Biblical apocrypha]], and tried joining a Pentecostal congregation. The thoughts and ideas he explored during this time formed the inspiration for his film ''Dogma'', the beginning of which features characters using the shot glass metaphor used by the priest. Though Smith still regularly attended mass as late as 1998,<ref name=Playboy/> he stated on "Back to the Well", a feature on the ''Clerks II'' documentary, that now he only goes to Mass on the day before he starts production of a movie, and the day before it premieres. He never smoked until his debut film, ''Clerks'', in which he used the cigarettes as a prop, but did not inhale. He has said that prior to filming ''Clerks'', he was a staunch non-smoker.{{Failed verification|date=September 2013}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silentbobspeaks.com |title=My Boring Ass Life|publisher=Silent Bob Speaks|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2015}} He quit smoking [[cigarettes]] in 2008 after taking up smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] after working with [[Seth Rogen]] on ''[[Zack and Miri Make a Porno]]''.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/02/kevin-smith-leno-smoking-pot-video_n_946832.html "Kevin Smith Talks Smoking Weed On Leno (VIDEO)"].
