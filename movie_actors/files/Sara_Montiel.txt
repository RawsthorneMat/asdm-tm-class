'''Sara Montiel''' (also '''Sarita Montiel''' or '''Saritísima'''; 10 March 1928 – 8 April 2013) was a Spanish [[singer]] and [[actress]].<ref name=Vanguardia /> She was a naturalized citizen of [[Mexico]].<ref name=Vanguardia />
Montiel was born in [[Campo de Criptana]] in the region of [[Castile–La Mancha]] in 1928 as María Antonia Abad (complete name ''María Antonia Alejandra Vicenta Elpidia Isidora Abad Fernández''). After her work in [[Juan de Orduña]]'s ''El Último Cuplé'' in 1957, Montiel worked in Europe and Latin America. Montiel's film ''Varietes'' was banned in Beijing in 1973. Her films ''El Último Cuple'' and ''La Violetera'' netted the highest gross revenues ever recorded for films made in the Spanish speaking movie industry during the 1950s/60s{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. She played the role of Antonia, the niece of [[Don Quixote]], in the 1947 [[Spain|Spanish]] film version of [[Cervantes]]'s great novel.

She was portrayed in the [[Pedro Almodóvar]] film ''[[Bad Education (film)|Bad Education]]'' by a male actor in drag ([[Gael García Bernal]]) as the [[cross-dressing]] character Zahara, and a film clip from one of her movies was used as well.

==Acting career==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
Montiel started in movies at 15 in her native [[Spain]] where she filmed her first movie playing an Islamic princess in the 1948 film ''[[Locura de Amor]]'', released in the US as ''[[The Mad Queen]]''. Later worked in [[Mexico]], starring in a dozen films in less than five years. [[Hollywood]] came calling afterwards, and she was introduced to [[United States]] moviegoers in the film ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'' (1954) co-starring with [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Burt Lancaster]], and directed by [[Robert Aldrich]]. She was offered the standard seven-year contract at [[Columbia Pictures]], which she refused, afraid of [[Hollywood]]'s typecasting policies for Hispanics{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. Instead she free-lanced at [[Warner Bros.]] with [[Mario Lanza]] and [[Joan Fontaine]] in ''Serenade'' (1956), directed by [[Anthony Mann]], and at [[RKO]] in [[Samuel Fuller]]'s ''[[Run of the Arrow]]'' (1957), opposite [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Charles Bronson]].

From ''El Ultimo Cuple'' (1957) on she combined filming, recording songs in five languages and performing live. Among the films during the 1960s and early 1970s were ''La Violetera'' (1958), ''Carmen, la de Ronda'' (1959), ''Mi Ultimo Tango'' (1960), ''Pecado de Amor'' (1961), ''La Bella Lola'' (a 1962 version of ''[[Camille (ballet)|Camille]]''), ''Casablanca, Nid d'espions''(1963), ''Samba'' (1964), ''La Femme Perdue'' (1966), ''Tuset Street'' (1967), ''Esa Mujer'' (1969), ''Varietes'' (1971) and others. By then she had become dissatisfied with the movie industry when producers started offering her roles in soft core porno films{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. In 1974 Montiel announced her retirement from movies but continued performing live, recording and starring on her own variety television shows in [[Spain]].<ref>[http://www.webpronews.com/sara-montiel-dies-actress-was-85-2013-04"Sara Montiel Dies; Actress Was 85"] webpronews.com</ref>

In November 2009, [[Alaska]] from the pop group [[Fangoria]] invited Montiel to record a track sharing vocals with her for the re-release of the band's album ''[[Absolutamente]]''. They recorded the title track "[[Absolutamente]]" as a duet. The music video for the song was released in early 2010.<ref>{{YouTube|95kpTK5vm3w|Music video for Absolutamente 2010}}</ref> She had no plans to retire{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}, and, in May 2011, after almost 40 years without making a movie, she accepted to perform in a feature film directed by Óscar Parra de Carrizosa. The film title is ''[[Abrázame]]'' and was shot on location in La Mancha.

==Personal information==
Montiel was born '''María Antonia Alejandra Abad Fernández''' in 1928 in [[Campo de Criptana]]{{citation needed|date=February 2015}},
[[Ciudad Real (province)|Ciudad Real, Spain]]. She entered films after winning a beauty and talent contest at age 15{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}. In her first movie she was credited as "María Alejandra" a shortened version of her real name. For her next film she changed her name to Sara, after her grandmother, and Montiel after the [[Montiel]] fields in the [[Castile–La Mancha]] region of her birth. She has been married four times{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}:
