'''Whip Wilson''' (born '''Roland Charles Meyers''' June 16, 1911, [[Granite City, Illinois]] &ndash; October 22, 1964, [[Los Angeles, California]]) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[cowboy]] [[film actor|film]] star of the late 1940s and into the 1950s, known for his roles in [[B-movie|B-westerns]].

He was one of eight children. Wilson had been a moderately successful [[singer]] before coming to Hollywood. Following Buck Jones's death in the famous [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] of 1942, which claimed the lives of 492 people, [[Monogram Pictures]] had been searching for someone to replace him. Producer [[Scott R. Dunlap]] saw Meyers, and thought he looked similar to Jones. This, apparently, was enough to build him into a cowboy star. Because of the fame being generated by [[Lash LaRue]], who used a [[bullwhip]] in his movies, Monogram decided to make Meyers a similar whip-wielding character, rechristening him ''Whip Wilson''.

==Movie career==
Wilson was a goodlooking man. When he first moved to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to pursue an acting career, producers built him up with a lot of press, but it would not be enough to take him to the height of major stardom. He did star in 22 B-westerns, more than [[Lash LaRue]], [[Sunset Carson]], [[Monte Hale]], [[Rex Allen]], or [[Eddie Dean (singer)|Eddie Dean]].

[[Monogram Pictures]] introduced Wilson to the public this way: "He was born on a fabulous ranch in [[Pecos, Texas]], was a [[rodeo]] champion, has a [[engineering]] degree, is a direct descendant of [[George Custer|General Custer]], and he was a [[World War II]] [[US Marines|Marine]] hero, and he does his own movie stunts." None of these claims was true. In fact, he had not even one shred of experience that could possibly resemble the fictional persona that Monogram created for him. He was one of the very few western film heroes of the day who was not a "cowboy" in real life. Most had at least some experience as genuine cowboys or cowgirls, and fit the part. Many had also actually served during World War II.

His first film was alongside Monogram's singing cowboy [[Jimmy Wakely]] in the 1948 film ''Silver Trails'', to give him experience in front of the camera. The next year Wilson starred in his own series films, the first being ''Crashin Thru'', followed by ''Haunted Trails'', ''Range Land'' and ''Riders of the Dusk''. He first was given a horse named "Silver Bullet", later shortened to "Bullet", then changed to "Rocket" due to [[Roy Rogers]] having a dog in his films named "Bullet."

Wilson may have come along too late to establish himself as a major star; studios were already phasing out low-budget westerns. Veteran comedian [[Andy Clyde]] was a valuable asset as co-star, but the series got little attention. After 12 films, Clyde left the cast, replaced by [[Fuzzy Knight]] and later by [[Jim Bannon]]. In 1950 Wilson starred in ''Gunslingers'', ''Arizona Territory'', ''Cherokee Uprising'', ''Fence Riders'', and ''Outlaws of Texas''. In 1951 his character continued in ''Lawless Cowboys'', ''Stage to Blue River'', ''Canyon Raiders'', and ''Abilene Trail''.

There was nothing novel or original about Wilson to distinguish himself from other cowboy stars. The name of his horse, the bullwhip gimmick, and the false past created by the producers were all derivative. Wilson's career never really took off, and by 1952 his Hollywood career was all but over, with him starring in ''[[Night Raiders]]'', with his last film being that same year, titled ''Wyoming Roundup''. He was hired to do the whip scenes in the [[Burt Lancaster]] film ''[[The Kentuckian]]''. It would be the last film he would work on. He did appear as a guest on TV's ''You Asked for It'', giving a bullwhip demonstration.

Wilson made little impact on the western film industry, although a Whip Wilson comic book series was published. Many of his co-stars, in later years, indicated they never really appreciated his work, but they did appreciate his kind demeanor and his character.

He married three times, and lived his last years with his third wife managing an apartment complex in Hollywood. On October 22, 1964, Wilson suffered a [[heart attack]], and died at the age of 53.

Years after his death, his [[widow]], Monica Wilson, stated; "He was handsome, intelligent, had a beautiful personality, a sense of humor, a good lover and a wonderful husband. Our love was proven love. We were asked many times in Hollywood how we stayed together. Our answer was true love will survive."

Sixteen of his films are available on [[DVD]] today.
