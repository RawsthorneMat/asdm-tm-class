==Early life==
Corman was born in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the son of Anne (née High) and William Corman, an engineer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/28/Roger-Corman.html |title=Roger Corman Biography (1926–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}</ref><ref name=owe>{{Cite book|last=H.W.

While at Stanford, Corman enlisted in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]]. After the end of World War II, Corman returned to Stanford and received a degree in [[industrial engineering]] in 1947.<ref name="STANFORDALUMNIMAGAZINE">[https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=29323 "The Award of a Lifetime for Roger Corman"], ''Stanford Alumni Magazine'', January/February 2010</ref> While at Stanford University, Roger Corman was initiated in the fraternity [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]. In 1948, he worked briefly at U.S. Electrical Motors on [[Slauson Avenue]] in Los Angeles, but his career in engineering lasted only four days; he began work on Monday and quit on Thursday, telling his boss "I've made a terrible mistake."<ref>{{cite web|last=Holte|first=Michael Ned|title=Value Engineering: Roger Corman with his own Context|url=http://www.eastofborneo.org/articles/value-engineering-roger-corman-within-his-own-context|publisher=East of Borneo|accessdate=May 24, 2012}}</ref>

More interested in film, Corman found work at [[20th Century Fox]] initially in the mail room. He worked his way up to a story reader. The one property that he liked the most and provided ideas for was filmed as ''[[The Gunfighter (film)|The Gunfighter]]'' with [[Gregory Peck]]. When Corman received no credit at all he left Fox and decided he would work in film by himself. Under the [[GI Bill]], Corman studied English Literature at [[Oxford University]]. He then returned to Los Angeles, beginning his film career in 1953 as a producer and screenwriter, then started directing films in 1955.

==Career==
[[File:Roger Corman crop.jpg|thumb|Corman in 2006]]
Corman began to direct films in the mid-1950s, including ''[[Swamp Women]]'' (1955). In his early period, he produced up to nine movies a year.  His fastest film was perhaps ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'' (1960), which was reputedly shot in two days and one night.<ref>Simpson, MJ (September 23, 1995). "Interview with Roger Corman" http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/interviews/rogercorman.html. Retrieved 2007-10-24. "I shot Little Shop of Horrors in two days and a night for about $30,000, and the picture has lasted all these years."</ref>{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Supposedly, he had made a bet that he could shoot an entire feature film in less than three days. Another version of the story claims that he had a set rented for a month, and finished using it with three days to spare, thus pushing him to use the set to make a new film. (This is a variation of the story behind 1963's ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'', much of which was filmed in two leftover days with [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Jack Nicholson]], after ''[[The Raven]]'', which featured them both, wrapped with two days to spare.)

In addition to producing and directing films for [[American International Pictures]] (AIP), Corman also partially funded other low-budget films released by other film companies. In 1959, Corman founded [[Filmgroup]] with his brother [[Gene Corman|Gene]], a company producing or releasing low-budget black-and-white films as [[double feature]]s for drive-ins and action houses. Finding that black-and-white double features were not as successful as colour films, Corman returned to AIP,<ref>pp. 22–41 Ray, Fred Olen ''Filmgroup'' in ''The New Poverty Row: Independent Filmmakers as Distributors'' McFarland, 1991</ref> and Filmgroup ceased operation in 1962.

==The Edgar Allan Poe adaptations==
Corman's greatest acclaim as a director came with his [[Edgar Allan Poe]] cycle released between 1959 and 1964. Based on the works of Poe, made through [[American International Pictures]] and mostly in collaboration with writer/scenarist [[Richard Matheson]], the series of eight films comprises ''[[House of Usher (film)|House of Usher]]'' (1960), ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum (1961 film)|The Pit and the Pendulum]]'' (1961), ''[[The Premature Burial (film)|The Premature Burial]]'' (1962), ''[[Tales of Terror]]'' (1962), ''[[The Raven (1963 film)|The Raven]]'' (1963), ''[[The Haunted Palace]]'' (1963), ''[[The Masque of the Red Death (film)|The Masque of the Red Death]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Tomb of Ligeia]]'' (1964). All but ''[[The Premature Burial]]'' starred [[Vincent Price]]. Other Poe films were made at AIP in the late 1960s and early 1970s directed by other filmmakers with Price in starring roles.

Corman also worked with set designer [[Daniel Haller]] and cinematographer [[Floyd Crosby]] on the series. Others who joined him include cinematographer [[Nicolas Roeg]] (on ''Masque''), writers [[Robert Towne]] and [[Charles Beaumont]], and actors [[Ray Milland]], [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Hazel Court]], [[Barbara Steele]], [[Debra Paget]], and [[Peter Lorre]]. After ''The Raven'' was completed, Corman reportedly realized that he still had some shooting days left before the sets were torn down and so made another film, ''[[The Terror (1963 film)|The Terror]]'' (1963), on the spot with the remaining cast, crew and sets.

==Other work==
He also directed one of [[William Shatner]]'s earliest appearances in a lead role with ''[[The Intruder (1962 film)|The Intruder]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Stranger'', 1962). Based on a novel by [[Charles Beaumont]], the film, made for approximately US$80,000,<ref>{{cite web|title=Box office / business for The Intruder|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055019/business|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref> is known for its treatment of [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and [[civil and political rights|civil rights]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Intruder|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDReviews32/the_intruder_corman.htm|work=DVD Beaver|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref>

The late 1960s saw Corman and his films give a voice to the counter-culture of the time. In 1966, Corman made the first biker movie with ''[[The Wild Angels]]''. It starred [[Peter Fonda]] and [[Nancy Sinatra]] and opened the 1966 Venice Film Festival. In 1967, ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'', written by [[Jack Nicholson]] and starring [[Peter Fonda]], began the psychedelic film craze of the late 1960s and was the American entry at Cannes that year. [[Joan Didion]] said she went to see ''The Wild Angels'' because "there on the screen was some news I was not getting from the ''New York Times''. I began to think I was seeing ideograms of the future."<ref name="Didion">Didion, Joan; The White Album; (1979) pg.100</ref>

In 1970, Corman founded [[New World Pictures]] which became a small independently-owned production/distribution studio,<ref>{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Gary|title=Roger Corman's New World Pictures|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/27/newworldpictures1.php|work=Bright Lights Film Journal|accessdate=April 19, 2013|date=January 2000}}</ref> making many cult films such as ''[[Women in Cages]]'' (1971), ''[[Death Race 2000]]'' (1975), ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]'' (1979), ''[[Galaxy of Terror]]'' (1981), ''[[Children of the Corn]]'' (1984), and the [[Joe Dante]] film ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]'' (1978).<ref>{{cite web|title=New World Picture: Production Company – filmography|url=http://www.imdb.com/company/co0065427/#productionX20company|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref> Corman's distribution side of New World brought many foreign films to mass audiences in the United States for the first time, including the works of [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[François Truffaut]], [[Federico Fellini]], and [[Akira Kurosawa]]. In a ten-year period, New World Pictures won more Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film than all other studios combined. Corman eventually sold New World to an investment group in 1983 and later formed Concorde Pictures and New Horizons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35133/shout-if-you-want-roger-corman-creatures-and-classic-gamera-dvds|title=Shout If You Want Roger Corman Creatures and Classic Gamera DVDs!}}</ref> Corman's penultimate film as director was ''[[Von Richthofen and Brown]]'' (1971). Corman had always wanted to make an aviation movie, having enjoyed piloting model planes as a young boy. He then returned to directing once more with ''[[Frankenstein Unbound]]'' (1990). In total, Roger Corman has produced over 300 movies and directed more than 50.

In 2009, Corman produced and directed alongside director [[Joe Dante]] the [[web series]] "Splatter" for Netflix.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/9-film-news/4300-roger-corman-and-joe-dante-splatter-netflix.html|title=Roger Corman and Joe Dante SPLATTER Netflix}}</ref> The protagonist of the film is portrayed by [[Corey Feldman]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17716|title=Full Info on Feldman, Corman and Dante's 'Splatter'}}</ref> and the story talks of the haunting tale of rock-and-roll legend Johnny Splatter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34261/see-a-gruesome-advance-clip-splatter|title=See a Gruesome Advance Clip from Splatter|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> He also started contributing trailer commentaries to Dante's [[web series]] [[Trailers From Hell]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Roger Corman|url=http://www.trailersfromhell.com/gurus/49|work=Trailers From Hell|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref>

Corman produced the 2010 films ''[[Dinoshark]]'' and ''[[Dinocroc vs. Supergator]]'' for the [[Syfy]] cable television channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35962/sharktopus-plot-details-and-dinoshark-image-revealed|title=Sharktopus Plot Details and Dinoshark Image Revealed!}}</ref> ''Dinoshark'' premiered on March 13, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36287/syfy-offers-a-sneak-peek-dinoshark-action|title=SyFy Offers a Sneak Peek at Dinoshark in Action!}}</ref> ''[[Sharktopus]]'', a Syfy production, premiered in September 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sharktopus (2010) (TV)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1619880/|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=August 9, 2010}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1964, [[Julie Corman|Julie Halloran]] applied for a job with Corman.  As Corman puts it, "I hired another girl and asked Julie for a date."  After a courtship of more than six years, they married in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20077891,00.html|title=Roger Corman's Flicks May Be 'B' Shlock, but No One in Hollywood Has Nurtured More 'A' Talent}}</ref> They live in Southern California and have four children.

==Remembrances and awards==
His autobiography, titled ''How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime'' (ISBN 0-306-80874-9), documents his experiences in the film industry.

In 1964, Corman was the youngest producer/director to be given a retrospective at the [[Cinémathèque Française]], as well as retrospectives at the [[British Film Institute]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

Corman was the subject of the 1978 documentary ''Roger Corman:  Hollywood's Wild Angel'', produced and directed by [[Christian Blackwood]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163354/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1 ''Roger Corman:  Hollywood's Wild Angel''] imdb.com</ref> Portions of the film reappeared in 2011's ''Corman's World''.

In 1998, he won the first Producer's Award ever given by the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

In 2006, Corman received the David O. Selznick Award from the [[Producers Guild of America]]. Also in 2006, his film ''[[House of Usher (film)|Fall of the House of Usher]]'' was among the twenty-five movies selected for the [[National Film Registry]], a compilation of significant films being preserved by the [[Library of Congress]].

In 2010, The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded Corman with an [[Academy Honorary Award]] at the inaugural [[Governors Awards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34601/see-roger-corman-receive-his-honorary-oscar|title=See Roger Corman Receive His Honorary Oscar}}</ref> on November 14, 2009.<ref>

In 2010, writer and actor [[Mark Gatiss]] interviewed Corman for his BBC documentary series ''[[A History of Horror]]'', of which the second half of the second episode focuses on Corman.<ref name=horrorqa>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vcwm7 |title=A History of Horror with Mark Gatiss – Q&A with Mark Gatiss |accessdate=November 12, 2010 |publisher=BBC }}</ref>

In 2010, Corman was inducted into the [[Beverly Hills High School]] Hall of Fame.

In 2012, Corman was honored with the Filmmaker on the Edge Award at the [[Provincetown International Film Festival]].

=="The Corman Film School"==
A number of noted film directors and producers worked with Corman, usually early in their careers, including [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Ron Howard]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Armondo Linus Acosta]], [[Paul Bartel]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Donald G. Jackson]], [[Gale Anne Hurd]], [[Carl Colpaert]], [[Joe Dante]], [[James Cameron]], [[John Sayles]], [[Monte Hellman]], [[George Armitage]], [[Jonathan Kaplan]], [[George Hickenlooper]], [[Curtis Hanson]], [[Jack Hill]], [[Robert Towne]], Michael Venzor and [[Timur Bekmambetov]]. Many have said that Corman's influence taught them some of the ins and outs of filmmaking.<ref name="EW">Nashawaty, Chris [http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/11/13/roger-corman-martin-scorsese-dennis-hopper/ "Roger Corman: Scorsese, Stallone, Sayles, and other A-listers talk about the B-movie King"] ''Entertainment Weekly''. Retrieved February 19, 2010</ref> In the extras for the DVD of ''[[The Terminator]]'', director James Cameron asserts, "I trained at the Roger Corman Film School." The British director [[Nicolas Roeg]] served as the [[cinematographer]] on ''[[The Masque of the Red Death (film)|The Masque of the Red Death]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodgothique.com/masqueofreddeath1964.html|title=MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH: The Apex of Roger Corman's Poe Films}}</ref> Cameron, Coppola, Demme, Hanson, Howard and Scorsese have all gone on to win [[Academy Award]]s.  Howard was reportedly told by Corman, "If you do a good job on this film, you'll never have to work for me again."

Actors who obtained their career breaks working for Corman include [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Peter Fonda]], [[Bruce Dern]], [[Michael McDonald (actor)|Michael McDonald]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Talia Shire]], [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Robert De Niro]], and [[David Carradine]], who received one of his first starring film roles in the Corman-produced ''[[Boxcar Bertha]]'' (1972) and went on to star in ''[[Death Race 2000]]''.

Many of Corman's protegés have paid their mentor homage by awarding him cameos in films, such as in ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'',<ref name="imagesjournal">{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue09/features/rogercorman/ |title="Roger Corman on The Blair Witch Project and why Mean Streets would have made a great blaxploitation film.

==Filmography==
{{Main|Roger Corman filmography}}
{{see also|List of actors who have appeared in multiple Best Picture Academy Award winners}}

The IMDB credits Corman with 55 directed films and some 385 produced films from 1954 through 2008, many as un-credited producer or executive producer (consistent with his role as head of his own New World Pictures from 1970 through 1983). Corman also has significant credits as writer and actor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000339/|title=Roger Corman|accessdate=September 16, 2012}}</ref>

===Cult Classics===
{{Main|Roger Corman's Cult Classics}}

In 2010, Roger Corman teamed up with [[Shout! Factory]] to release new DVD and Blu-ray editions of Corman productions under the name [[Roger Corman's Cult Classics]]. The releases have concentrated on 1970–1980s films he produced through New World rather than directed. These titles include ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]'', ''[[Death Race 2000]]'', ''[[Galaxy of Terror]]'', ''[[Forbidden World]]'' and ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]'', with additional titles continuing to be released.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shout!
