'''Dario Argento''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdarjo arˈdʒɛnto|lang}}; born September 7, 1940) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[film director]], [[film producer|producer]] and [[screenwriter]]. He is best known for his work in the horror film genre, particularly in the subgenre known as [[giallo]], and for his influence on modern [[horror film|horror movies]].

== Life and career ==

Argento was born in [[Rome]], the son of film producer and executive Salvatore Argento and [[Brazil]]ian-born photographer Elda Luxardo. He began his career in film as a critic, writing for various magazines while still attending high school.

Argento did not attend college, electing rather to take a job as a columnist at the newspaper ''Paese Sera''. While working at the newspaper, Argento also began working as a screenwriter. His most notable work was for [[Sergio Leone]]; he and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] collaborated on the story for the [[spaghetti western]] classic ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]''. Soon after that film's 1969 release, Argento began working on his directorial debut, the [[giallo]] film ''[[The Bird with the Crystal Plumage]]'', which was released in 1970 and was a major hit in [[Italy]]. Argento continued to concentrate largely on the giallo genre, directing two more successful thrillers, ''[[The Cat o' Nine Tails]]'' (1971) and ''[[Four Flies on Grey Velvet]]'' (1972). Along with ''[[The Bird with the Crystal Plumage]]'', these three films are frequently referred to as Argento's "animal trilogy". The director then turned his attention away from giallo movies, filming two Italian TV dramas and a period comedy (''[[The Five Days]]'') in 1973.
Argento returned to thrillers with 1975's ''[[Deep Red]]'', frequently cited by many critics as the best giallo ever made. The film made Argento famous internationally and inspired a number of other directors to work in the genre ([[John Carpenter]] has frequently referred to the influence Argento's early work had on ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'').

Argento's next movie was ''[[Suspiria]]'' (1977), a violent supernatural thriller. Lacking the constraints of the more conventional giallo subgenre, ''Suspiria'' is a semi-surreal work of art, where plot and character are secondary to sound and vision. Argento planned for ''Suspiria'' to be the first of a trilogy about "[[The Three Mothers]]", three ancient witches residing in three different modern cities. The second movie of the trilogy was 1980's ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]''. ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'' (2007) belatedly concluded the trilogy.

In between the making of the first two "mothers", in 1978, Argento collaborated with [[George A. Romero]] on ''[[Dawn of the Dead]]'', earning a producer credit and also providing soundtrack work for the [[zombie]] classic. Argento oversaw the European release of the film (where it was titled ''Zombi'') which was much shorter and featured much more of the score written and performed by [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]].

After ''Inferno'', Argento returned to the more conventional giallo style with ''[[Tenebrae (film)|Tenebrae]]'' (1982). He then attempted to combine giallo and supernatural fantasy in 1985's ''[[Phenomena (film)|Phenomena]]'', also known as ''Creepers'', which was one of [[Jennifer Connelly]]'s earliest movies. ''Phenomena'' also showed Argento's predilection for using new technology, as evidenced by the film's several prowling [[Steadicam]] shots. Both films received a lukewarm reception upon their release (although each has been positively reappraised since).

Argento subsequently took a break from directing to write two screenplays for Mario Bava's son, [[Lamberto Bava]]: ''[[Dèmoni]]'' (1985) and ''[[Dèmoni 2]]'' (1986).

[[File:Dario Argento in 1994.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Dario Argento interviewed by Martin Sauvageau during the Festival International du Cinéma Fantastique de Montréal in 1994]]

''[[Opera (film)|Opera]]'' followed in 1987. Set in [[Parma]]'s Regio Theatre during a production of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'', the production was beset by real-life misfortunes that Argento suspected were caused by the supposed traditional "curse" on the Shakespearean play. Argento's father died during its production, [[Vanessa Redgrave]] quit the project before filming began, he had problems working with his former long-time girlfriend and collaborator [[Daria Nicolodi]] on-set and the cast and crew were plagued by several minor accidents and mishaps.

During the early 1990s, Argento was in the process of collaborating with Italian director [[Lucio Fulci]] on a horror film. Due to financial trouble, the project was continually postponed. Fortunately in 1996, Argento was able to gather funding, but was unable to actually collaborate with Fulci as Fulci died in March that year. The film would be later be directed by Sergio Stivaletti as ''The Wax Mask'', with Argento and Fulci both receiving screenwriting credits. 

His 1996 film ''[[The Stendhal Syndrome]]'', in which a policewoman (played by Argento's daughter, [[Asia Argento|Asia]]) who suffers from [[Stendhal syndrome]] is trapped by a [[serial killer]] in an abandoned warehouse, was the first Italian film to use [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).  Moreover, the film's opening scene was shot in [[Florence]] at Italy's famed [[Uffizi Gallery]]. Argento is the only director ever granted permission to shoot there. ''The Stendhal Syndrome'' was distributed in the U.S. by cult [[B-movie]] distribution company [[Troma Entertainment]]. He later directed 1998's [[The Phantom of the Opera (1998 film)| The Phantom of the Opera]] and 2001's [[Sleepless (2001 film)| Sleepless]].

[[File:Dario Argento at Torino Film Festival 2006.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Dario Argento discusses his film ''[[Pelts (Masters of Horror episode)|Pelts]]'' at the [[Torino Film Festival]] in 2006]]

2004's ''[[The Card Player]]'', a giallo about a killer whose murders are conducted during Internet poker matches with the Rome police, earned a mixed reception: some fans appreciated the techno music score composed by ex-Goblin member [[Claudio Simonetti]], but felt the film was too mainstream, with little of Argento's usual flourish.

2005 saw the TV broadcast of Argento's ''[[Do You Like Hitchcock?]]'', in which the director paid homage to Alfred Hitchcock after decades of being compared to him by critics. Later that year, he directed an episode of ''[[Masters of Horror]]'', a [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television series, called "[[Jenifer (Masters of Horror episode)|Jenifer]]". Soon afterwards, Argento directed an adaption of the [[F. Paul Wilson]] short story "[[Pelts (Masters of Horror episode)|Pelts]]" for season 2 of the same series.

Argento finished the final film of his [[The Three Mothers|Three Mothers trilogy]], ''[[The Mother of Tears]]'', which is set in Rome and centers on the titular "third mother", Mater Lacrimarum. Argento and Jace Anderson share writing credits for the film. Asia Argento was cast as the lead player, along with her mother and frequent Argento collaborator [[Daria Nicolodi]] in a supporting role. [[Udo Kier]], who appeared in Argento's ''[[Suspiria]]'', and [[Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni]], who appeared in three of his previous films, both have pivotal roles in the final ''Mothers'' chapter.

On 26 June 2009, ''[[Giallo (film)|Giallo]]'' premiered at the [[Edinburgh Film Festival]]. The following month he announced that he had started working on a [[3-D film|3D]] [[remake]] of ''Deep Red'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spettacoli.tiscali.it/articoli/cinema/09/07/03/argento_profondo_rosso_3d.html |title=Dario Argento pronto a girare "Profondo Rosso in 3D" |author=Redazione Tiscal |work=tiscali.it |date=3 July 2009 |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> but subsequently this project was shelved due to the commercial failure of ''Giallo'' in Italian cinemas. He then announced his decision to write a new screenplay. In 2011, Argento signed on to produce the American remake of his cult film ''Suspiria''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38515/dario-argento-gives-his-blessing-suspiria-remake-a-go|title=Dario Argento Gives His Blessing - Suspiria Remake a Go!|work=Dread Central |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> On 4 March 2011, it was announced that [[Rutger Hauer]] had signed on to play [[Van Helsing]] in Argento's ''[[Dracula 3D]]'', which was scheduled to begin shooting in [[Budapest]] later in the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/04/rutger-hauer-dracula-batman-hobo|title=Rutger Hauer confirms he will play Van Helsing in Dario Argento's 'Dracula 3D' -- EXCLUSIVE|author=Clark Collis|work=[[Entertainment Weekly|ew.com]] |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> It was released on 19 May 2012.

== Other work ==

He is involved in a horror [[souvenir|memorabilia]] store located at Via dei Gracchi 260 in [[Rome]] named Profondo Rosso, after his classic film ''[[Deep Red]]''. In the cellar is a collection of his movies. The store is managed by his long-time collaborator and friend [[Luigi Cozzi]].

He has contributed in the development of the survival horror video game ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'', and also in the dubbing of the Dr. Kyne character in the Italian version of the game.

== Works and criticism==

[[Maitland McDonagh]] wrote about Argento in her book ''Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento'' (1991). Argento is also mentioned in ''Art of Darkness'', a collection of promotional stills, poster art and critical essays edited by Chris Gallant. British journalist Alan Jones published ''Profondo Argento'', a compendium of set reports, interviews and biographical detail. In ''Dario Argento'' film journalist James Gracey provides fresh critical analysis and an exploration of Argento's far-reaching impact on modern horror cinema.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kamerabooks.co.uk/darioargento/index.php?title_isbn=9781842433188 |title=Dario Argento by James Gracey, published by Kamera Books |work=kamerabooks.co.uk |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> English [[sound design]]er, writer and musician Heather Emmett published ''Sounds to Die For: Speaking the Language of Horror Film Sound'', which includes the first in-depth study of the use of sound in Argento's films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flaithulach.co.uk/soundstodiefor.html |title=Sounds to Die For |work=flaithulach.co.uk |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>

=== Critical decline ===
Starting with 1996's ''[[The Stendhal Syndrome]]'', Argento's films have been generally poorly received by critics. ''[[Fangoria]]'' wrote in 2010, "over the last decade, standards have slipped. For a filmmaker who was always so precise in his construction and cutting, his later films such as ''The Phantom of the Opera'' and ''The Card Player'' are sloppy, stitched together so carelessly that they leak vital fluid. Gradually, the kaleidoscopic style that once characterized his films has slowly blanched away."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php/reviews/movies/873-giallo-film-review |title="GIALLO" (Film Review) |last=Kloda |first=James |date=16 May 2010 |work=[[Fangoria|fangoria.com]] |accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref>
