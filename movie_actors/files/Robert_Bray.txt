In 1942, Bray joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] and saw action in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] during [[World War II]]. He finished the war at the rank of [[Master Sergeant#United States|master sergeant]] and then aspired to become a [[taxidermist]] or the owner of a [[hunting]]/[[fishing]] lodge.<ref name=imdb>{{IMDb name|0106248}}</ref>

Instead, Bray entered films in 1946 under contract to [[RKO]]. He was marketed as the "next [[Gary Cooper]]" but appeared in B Westerns like 1949's ''[[Rustlers (1949 film)|Rustlers]]''. In the 1950s, the then freelancing actor appeared in a varied number of roles including the 1952 episode [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0506034/ "Thunder Over Inyo"] of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]] ''[[The Adventures of Kit Carson]]''.

He appeared twice on ABC's ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', with [[Hugh O'Brian]] in the title role.

Early in 1960, Bray was cast as Tom Byson, with [[Beverly Garland]] as Dr. Nora James, in the episode "Three Graves" of the NBC western series, ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', starring [[Darren McGavin]]. In the storyline, mystery shrouds three mysterious recent graves in a town along the [[Mississippi River]]. Townspeople refuse to discuss what happened, but speculation centers on an epidemic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0687120/|title="Three Graves", March 14, 1960|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref>

In the 1960-1961 television season, Bray played Simon Kane, along with [[Wayne Rogers]] as Luke Perry and [[Richard Eyer]] as David "Davey" Kane, Simon's son, in the ABC series ''Stagecoach West'', a black-and-white production of [[Dick Powell]]'s [[Four Star Television]]. Bray and Rogers portrayed the co-owners of the Timberland Stage Line which carried passengers from [[Missouri]] to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] during the 1860s.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/stagecoach-west/show/9582/summary.html Stagecoach West]</ref>

He starred in three episodes of NBC's [[western (genre)|western]] ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'' between 1960 and 1963. He appeared in three episodes of CBS's ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]''. In 1959 he played Private Detective and murder victim Carl Davis in "The Case of the Foot-Loose Doll." In the 1962 episode, "The Case of the Angry Astronaut," he had the role of title character and defendant Mitch Heller; and in 1963 he portrayed wealthy [[murder]] victim Martin Walden (Episode 180, [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0673361/ "The Case of the Potted Planter"]).

He appeared in four episodes of CBS's anthology suspense series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' between 1958 and 1961. In 1958, Bray was offered a supporting role in [[Film director|director]] [[Joshua Logan]]'s film adaptation of ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', but he decided instead to star in low-budget films for [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]]. It was a strategic error in his career, for ''South Pacific'' became a smash success.<ref name=imdb/>

In 1964, Bray won the role of [[Corey Stuart]] in ''Lassie'' because of his affinity for animals and their reciprocity toward him. That same year, ''Lassie'' went to [[color]] film. Stuart, according to the plot, acquired Lassie after the former owners, the Martin family (played by [[Hugh Reilly]], [[June Lockhart]], and [[Jon Provost]]), moved to [[Australia]]. Lassie's life then grew more exciting with rescues and adventures in the [[United States National Forest|national forest]] setting. On three episodes, Bray appeared with former [[child actor]] [[Bobby Diamond]] of NBC's ''[[Fury (TV series)|Fury]]''. Bray was replaced in 1968 by two younger rangers. The storyline attributes the end of Bray's role to injuries that the character sustained while fighting a [[forest fire]].<ref>[http://www.lassie.com/lassie_star.html Lassie Star]</ref>

Bray and his wife, Joan, retired to [[Bishop, California|Bishop]], [[California]], in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. He was often seen in his [[Winnebago Industries|Winnebago]] in Bishop with his dog "Lady". Bray was a fly fisherman, hunter, model duck carver, and all-around sportsman.<ref name=imdb/>

==Death==
He spent his last years in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|High Sierras]] where he had made many of his early western films.
