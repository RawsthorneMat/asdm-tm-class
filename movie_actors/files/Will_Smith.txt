==Recording and acting career==
[[File:Will Smith - Emmy Awards 1993.jpg|thumb|right|Smith at the Emmy Awards in 1993]]

===Early work===
Smith started as the [[MC#Hip hop|MC]] of the hip-hop duo [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]], with his childhood friend [[DJ Jazzy Jeff|Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes]] as [[turntablist]] and producer,<ref name=tca>Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2002</ref> as well as Ready Rock C (Clarence Holmes) as the [[beatboxing|human beat box]].

Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.<ref name=tca/> The [[Internal Revenue Service]] eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and [[garnishment|garnished]] his income.<ref>{{cite interview|first=Will|last=Smith|interviewer=[[Steve Kroft]]|title=60 Minutes|callsign=CBS|date=December 2, 2007}}</ref> Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990, when the [[NBC]] television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', around him.<ref name=tca/>

The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming "the biggest movie star in the world," studying [[List of highest-grossing films|box office successes]]' common characteristics.<ref name="Keegan" />

===Feature films===
Smith's first major roles were in the drama ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]'' (1993) and the action film ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'' (1995) in which he starred opposite [[Martin Lawrence]].

In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]''. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=independenceday.htm |title=Independence Day |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref> He later struck gold again in the summer of 1997 alongside [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in the summer hit ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]'' playing [[Agent J]]. In 1998, Smith starred with [[Gene Hackman]] in ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]''.<ref name=tca/>

He turned down the role of [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] in ''[[The Matrix]]'' in favor of ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999).
