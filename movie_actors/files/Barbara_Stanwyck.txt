'''Barbara Stanwyck''' (nee '''Ruby Catherine Stevens'''; July 16, 1907 – January 20, 1990) was an American actress. She was a film and television star, known during her 60-year career as a consummate and versatile professional with a strong, realistic screen presence, and a favorite of directors including [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Frank Capra]]. After a short but notable career as a stage actress in the late 1920s, she made 85 films in 38 years in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], before turning to television.

Orphaned at the age of four and partially raised in foster homes, by 1944 Stanwyck had become the highest-paid woman in the United States. She was nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] four times, for ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' (1937), ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' (1941), ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944) and ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number]]'' (1948). For her television work, she won three [[Emmy Award]]s, for ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'' (1961), ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Thorn Birds (TV miniseries)|The Thorn Birds]]'' (1983). ''The Thorn Birds'' also won her a [[Golden Globe]].  She received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Oscar]] at the [[54th Academy Awards|1982 Academy Award ceremony]] and the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]] in 1986. She was also the recipient of honorary lifetime awards from the [[American Film Institute]] (1987), the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] (1986), the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] (1981) and the [[Screen Actors Guild]] (1967). Stanwyck received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1941 and was ranked as the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|11th greatest female star]] of all time in 1999, by the [[American Film Institute]].<ref>{{Wayback |date=20061020084914 |url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx |title="AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars."}} ''[[American Film Institute]]''.

==Early life==
Barbara Stanwyck was born Ruby Catherine Stevens on July 16, 1907, in [[Brooklyn, New York]].<ref name="Madsen8">Madsen 1994, p. 8.</ref> She was the fifth and youngest child of Catherine Ann (née McPhee) and Byron E.

During the summers of 1916 and 1917, Ruby toured with Mildred, and practiced her sister's routines backstage.<ref name="M10"/> Watching the movies of [[Pearl White]], whom Ruby idolized, also influenced her drive to be a performer.<ref>Callahan 2012, p. 222.</ref> At age 14, she dropped out of school to take a job wrapping packages at a department store in Brooklyn.<ref name="Prono240">Prono 2008, p. 240.</ref> Ruby never attended high school, "although early biographical thumbnail sketches had her attending Brooklyn's famous [[Erasmus Hall High School]]."<ref>Madsen 1994, p. 11.</ref> Soon after, she took a job filing cards at the Brooklyn telephone office for a salary of $14 a week, a salary that allowed her to become financially independent.<ref>Madsen 1994, pp. 11–12.</ref> She disliked both jobs; her real interest was to enter show business even as her sister Mildred discouraged the idea. She then took a job cutting dress patterns for '' [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine, but because customers complained about her work, she was fired.<ref name="M12">Madsen 1994, p. 12.</ref> Her next job was as a typist for the Jerome H. Remick Music Company, a job she reportedly enjoyed. However, her continuing ambition was to work in show business and her sister finally gave up trying to dissuade her.<ref>Madsen 1994, pp. 12–13.</ref>

==Ziegfeld girl and Broadway success==
[[File:Barbara Stanwyck, Ziegfeld girl, by Alfred Cheney Johnston, ca. 1924.jpg|thumb|right|Barbara Stanwyck as a Ziegfeld girl (c. 1924)]]
In 1923, a few months before her 16th birthday, Ruby auditioned for a place in the chorus at the Strand Roof, a [[night club]] over the [[Mark Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]] in [[Times Square]].<ref>Madsen 1994, p. 13.</ref> A few months later, she obtained a job as a dancer in the 1922 and 1923 seasons of the [[Ziegfeld Follies]], dancing at the [[New Amsterdam Theater]]. "I just wanted to survive and eat and have a nice coat," Stanwyck said.<ref name=Callahan>Callahan 2012, p. 9.</ref><ref name="Prono241">Prono 2008, p. 241.</ref> For the next several years, she worked as a chorus girl, performing from midnight to seven a.m. at nightclubs owned by [[Texas Guinan]]. She also occasionally served as a dance instructor at a [[speakeasy]] for gays and lesbians owned by Guinan.<ref>Madsen 1994, pp. 17–18.</ref>  One of her good friends during those years was pianist [[Oscar Levant]], who described her as being "wary of sophisticates and phonies."<ref name=Callahan/>

In 1926, Billy LaHiff, who owned a popular pub frequented by showpeople, introduced Ruby to [[impresario]] [[Willard Mack]].<ref>Madsen 1994, p. 21.</ref> Mack was casting his play ''[[The Noose (play)|The Noose]]'' and LaHiff suggested that the part of the chorus girl be played by a real chorus girl. Mack agreed and after a successful audition, gave the part to Ruby.<ref>Madsen 1994, p. 22.</ref> She co-starred with actors [[Rex Cherryman]] and [[Wilfred Lucas]].<ref>Wayne 2009, p. 17.</ref> As initially staged, the play was not a success.<ref name="M26" /> In an effort to improve it, Mack decided to expand Ruby's part to include more pathos.<ref>Madsen 1994, p. 25.</ref> ''The Noose'' re-opened on October 20, 1926, and became one of the most successful plays of the season, running on Broadway for nine months and 197 performances.<ref name="Prono241" /> At the suggestion of either Mack or [[David Belasco]], Ruby changed her name to Barbara Stanwyck by combining the first name of her character, [[Barbara Frietchie]], with Stanwyck, after the name of another actress in the play, Jane Stanwyck.<ref name="M26">Madsen 1994, p. 26.</ref>

Stanwyck became a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star soon after when she was cast in her first leading role in ''Burlesque'' (1927). She received rave reviews and it was a huge hit.<ref>Smith 1985, p. 8.</ref> Film actor [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]] would later say on a talk show in the 1960s: "The greatest Broadway show I ever saw was a play in the 1920s called 'Burlesque'." In [[Arthur Hopkins]]' autobiography, ''To a Lonely Boy,'' he describes how he came about casting Stanwyck, saying: "After some search for the girl, I interviewed a nightclub dancer who had just scored in a small emotional part in a play that did not run (''The Noose''). She seemed to have the quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since [[Pauline Lord]]. She and (Hal) Skelly were the perfect team, and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers kept coming. There was no competing with them. She became a picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck." He also describes Stanwyck as "The greatest natural actress of our time," noting with sadness, "One of the theater's great potential actresses was embalmed in celluloid."<ref>Hopkins 1937 {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Around this time, Stanwyck was summoned by film producer Bob Kane to make a screen test for his upcoming 1927 silent film ''[[Broadway Nights]].'' She lost the lead role because she could not cry in the screen test but was given a minor part as a [[fan dancer]]. This was Stanwyck's first film appearance.<ref>[http://www.arabella-and-co.com/5/bsmovies.htm "Barbara Stanwyck."] ''Arabella-and-co.com''. Retrieved: June 19, 2012.</ref>

While playing in ''Burlesque,'' Stanwyck had been introduced to her future husband, actor [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]], by [[Oscar Levant]].<ref>Wayne 2009, p. 20.</ref> Stanwyck and Fay were married on August 26, 1928, and soon moved to Hollywood.<ref name="Nas"/>

==Film career==
[[File:Stanwyck - 1942 film.JPG|thumb|left|In ''[[The Gay Sisters]]'' (1942)]]
Stanwyck's first sound film was ''[[The Locked Door]]'' (1929), followed by ''Mexicali Rose'', released in the same year. Neither film was successful; nonetheless, [[Frank Capra]] chose Stanwyck for his ''[[Ladies of Leisure]]'' (1930).<ref name="Prono241" /> Numerous prominent roles followed, among them the children's nurse who saves two little girls from being gradually starved to death by [[Clark Gable]]'s vicious character in ''[[Night Nurse (1931 film)|Night Nurse]]'' (1931); '' [[So Big! (1932 film)|So Big!]]'', as a valiant midwest farm  woman (1932); ''[[Shopworn]]'' 1932; the ambitious woman from "the wrong side of the tracks" in ''[[Baby Face (film)|Baby Face]]'' (1933); the self-sacrificing title character in ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' (1937); Molly Monahan in ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' (1939) with [[Joel McCrea]]; the con artist who falls for her intended victim (played by [[Henry Fonda]]) in ''[[The Lady Eve]]'' (1941); the extremely successful, independent doctor Helen Hunt in ''[[You Belong to Me (1941 film)|You Belong to Me]]'' (1941) also with Fonda; a nightclub performer who gives a professor (played by Gary Cooper) a better understanding of "modern English" in the comedy ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' (1941); the woman who talks an infatuated insurance salesman ([[Fred MacMurray]]) into killing her husband in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944); the columnist caught up in white lies and a holiday romance in ''[[Christmas in Connecticut]]'' (1945); and the doomed wife in ''[[Sorry, Wrong Number]]'' (1948). She also played a doomed concert pianist in ''[[The Other Love]]'' (1947); the piano music was played by [[Ania Dorfmann]], who drilled Stanwyck for three hours a day until she was able to move her arms and hands to match the music.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=518184%7C518056&name=The-Other-Love "Overview: 'The Other Love' (1947)."] ''Turner Classic movies''.. Retrieved: October 27, 2014.</ref> Stanwyck was reportedly one of the many actresses considered for the role of [[Scarlett O'Hara]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), although she did not receive a screen test. In 1944, Stanwyck was the highest-paid woman in the United States.<ref name="Prono241" />

[[Pauline Kael]] described Stanwyck's acting, "[she] seems to have an intuitive understanding of the fluid physical movements that work best on camera" and in reference to her early 1930s film work, "early talkies sentimentality&nbsp;... only emphasizes Stanwyck's remarkable modernism".<ref>Kael, Pauline. [http://www.cinemagraphe.com/barbara-stanwyck.php "Quotation of review of the film Ladies of Leisure."] ''5001 Nights At The Movies'', 1991, p. 403.</ref>

Many of her roles involved strong characters.  In ''Double Indemnity,'' Stanwyck brought out the cruel nature of the "grim, unflinching murderess," marking her as the "most notorious femme" in the [[film noir]] genre.<ref>Hannsberry 2009, p. 3.</ref> Yet, Stanwyck was known for her accessibility and kindness to the backstage crew on any film set. She knew the names of their wives and children. [[Frank Capra]] said of Stanwyck: "She was destined to be beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras. In a Hollywood popularity contest she would win first prize hands down."<ref name="Eyman">Eyman, Scott. "The Lady Stanwyck". ''The Palm Beach Post (Florida)'', July 15, 2007, p.&nbsp;1J.

[[William Holden]] and Stanwyck were friends of long standing.  When Stanwyck and Holden were presenting the [[Academy Award for Sound|Best Sound Oscar]], Holden paused to pay a special tribute to her for saving his career when Holden was cast in the lead for ''[[Golden Boy (film)|Golden Boy]]'' (1939). After a series of unsteady daily performances, he was about to be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: "A few years ago I stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish".<ref>Capua 2009, p. 165.</ref>

==Television career==
When Stanwyck's film career declined in 1957, she moved to television. Her {{ytv|1961}}–{{ytv|1962}} series ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'' was not a ratings success but earned her an [[Emmy Award]].<ref name="Prono241" /> The {{ytv|1965}}–{{ytv|1969}} [[Western (genre)|Western]] series ''[[The Big Valley]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] made her one of the most popular actresses on television, winning her another Emmy.<ref name="Prono241"/> She was billed as "Miss Barbara Stanwyck". She also appeared in the television series, ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' with [[Robert Stack]]. She appeared in 1963 episode of ''[[Wagon Train]]'', the "Molly Kincaid Story", and alongside [[Elvis Presley]] in the movie ''[[Roustabout (film)|Roustabout]]'' in 1964.

Years later, Stanwyck earned her third Emmy for ''[[The Thorn Birds (TV miniseries)|The Thorn Birds]]''.<ref name="Prono241" /> In {{ytv|1985}}, she made three guest appearances in the primetime soap opera ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]'' prior to the launch of its short-lived spin-off series ''[[The Colbys]]'' in which she starred alongside [[Charlton Heston]], [[Stephanie Beacham]] and [[Katharine Ross]]. Unhappy with the experience, Stanwyck remained with the series for only one season (it lasted for two), and her role as Constance Colby Patterson would prove to be her last.<ref name="Prono241" />  [[Earl Hamner Jr.]] (producer of ''[[The Waltons]]'') had initially wanted Stanwyck for the lead role of Angela Channing on the 1980s soap opera ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', but she turned it down and the role went to her best friend, [[Jane Wyman]].

==Personal life==

===Marriages and relationships===
[[File:Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck in 1941.jpg|right|thumb|With [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] in 1941]]
While playing in ''The Noose'', Stanwyck fell in love with her married co-star, [[Rex Cherryman]], who became her fiancé in 1928.<ref name="Nas"/> Cherryman had become ill early in 1928 and his doctor advised him to take a sea voyage to Paris where he and Stanwyck had arranged to meet. While still at sea, he died of [[sepsis|septic poisoning]], at the age of 31.<ref>Madsen 1994, p. 32.</ref>

On August 26, 1928, Stanwyck married her ''Burlesque'' co-star, Frank Fay. She and Fay later claimed that they disliked each other at first, but became close after the sudden death of Cherryman.<ref name="Nas"/>  A botched abortion at age fifteen had resulted in complications which left Stanwyck unable to have children.<ref>Wilson 2013, p. 51.</ref> After moving to Hollywood, the couple adopted a son, Dion Anthony "Tony" Fay, on December 5, 1932. The marriage was a troubled one. Fay's successful career on Broadway did not translate to the big screen, whereas Stanwyck achieved Hollywood stardom. Fay engaged in physical confrontations with his young wife, especially when he was inebriated.<ref>Wayne 2009, p. 37.</ref><ref>Callahan 2012, pp. 36, 38.</ref> Some claim that this union was the basis for ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]''.<ref name="Prono242">Prono 2008, p. 242.</ref> The couple divorced on December 30, 1935. Stanwyck won custody of their troubled adoptive son whom she had raised with a strict authoritarian hand and demanding expectations.<ref>Callahan 2012, p. 85.</ref> Stanwyck and her son were estranged after his childhood, meeting only a few times after he became an adult. The child whom she had adopted in infancy, "resembled her in just one respect: both were, effectively orphans." <ref>Corliss, Richard. "That Old Feelin': Ruby in the Rough." ''Time magazine'', August 12, 2001.</ref>

In 1936, while making the film ''His Brother's Wife'' (1936), Stanwyck became involved with her co-star, [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]. Rather than a torrid romance, their relationship was more one of mentor and pupil. Stanwyck served as support and adviser to the younger Taylor, a transplant from a small Nebraska town, guiding his career and acclimating him to the sophisticated Hollywood culture. The couple began living together, sparking newspaper reports about the two. Stanwyck was hesitant to remarry after the failure of her first marriage. However, their 1939 marriage was arranged with the help of Taylor's studio [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], a common practice in Hollywood's [[Golden Age of Hollywood|golden age]]. [[Louis B. Mayer]] had insisted on the two stars marrying and went as far as presiding over arrangements at the wedding.<ref>Callahan 2012, p. 75.</ref><ref>Wayne 2009, p. 76.</ref> She and Taylor enjoyed time together outdoors during the early years of their marriage, and owned acres of prime West Los Angeles property. Their large ranch and home in the [[Mandeville Canyon]] section of [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood, Los Angeles]], is still referred to by the locals as the old "Robert Taylor ranch."<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/2005/10/06/cx_sc_1007homeslide_5.html "The 10 most expensive homes in the US: 2005."] ''Forbes,'' 2005. Retrieved: November 17, 2011.</ref>

In 1950, Stanwyck and Taylor mutually decided to divorce, and after his insistence, she proceeded with the official filing of the papers.<ref>Wayne 2009, p. 87.</ref> There have been many rumors regarding the cause of their divorce, but after World War II, Taylor had attempted to create a life away from Hollywood, a goal that Stanwyck did not share.<ref>Callahan 2012, pp. 87, 164.</ref> Taylor had romantic affairs, and there were unsubstantiated rumors about Stanwyck having had affairs as well. After the divorce, they acted together in Stanwyck's last feature film, ''[[The Night Walker (film)|The Night Walker]]'' (1964). Stanwyck never remarried and cited Taylor as the love of her life, according to her friend and ''Big Valley'' co-star, Linda Evans. She took his death in 1969 very hard and took a long break from film and television work.<ref>Callahan 2012, p. 77.</ref>

Stanwyck was one of the most well-liked actors in Hollywood and was friends with many of her fellow actors (as well as crew members of her films and TV shows), including [[Joel McCrea]] and his wife [[Frances Dee]], [[George Brent]], [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], [[Henry Fonda]] (who had a lifelong crush on her and a rumored affair), [[James Stewart]], [[Linda Evans]], [[Joan Crawford]], [[Jack Benny]] and his wife [[Mary Livingstone]], [[William Holden]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Fred McMurray]], and many others.<ref>Wayne 2009, pp. 146, 166.</ref>

Stanwyck had a romantic affair with actor [[Robert Wagner]], whom she met on the set of ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953). Wagner, who was 22, and Stanwyck, who was 45 at the beginning of the relationship, had a four-year romance, which is described in Wagner's memoir, ''Pieces of My Heart'' (2008).<ref>Wagner and Eyman 2008, p. 64.</ref> Stanwyck ended the relationship.<ref>King, Susan. "Wagner Memoir Tells of Wood Death, Stanwyck Affair." ''San Jose Mercury News (California)'' October 5, 2008, p. 6D. Retrieved: via ''Access World News'': June 16, 2009.</ref> In the 1950s, Stanwyck also, reportedly, had a one-night stand with the much younger [[Farley Granger]], which he wrote about in his autobiography ''Include Me Out: My Life from Goldwyn to Broadway'' (2007).<ref>Granger and Calhoun 2007, p. 131.</ref><ref>Callahan 2012, p. 163.</ref><ref>Wayne 2009, p. 166.</ref>

===Political views===
Stanwyck opposed the presidency of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. She felt that if someone from her disadvantaged background had risen to success, others should be able to do the same without government intervention or assistance.<ref name="WilsonVictoria">Wilson 2013, p. 266.</ref> For Stanwyck, indisputably, "hard work with the prospect of rich reward was the American way." Stanwyck became an early member of the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]] (MPA) with its founding in 1944. The mission of this special interest group, a coalition to monitor the content of Hollywood films, was to "...&nbsp;combat&nbsp;... subversive methods [used in the industry] to undermine and change the American way of life." <ref>Ross 2011, p. 108.</ref><ref>Wilson 2013, p. 858.</ref> She went on to publicly support the investigations of [[HUAC]], [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], both she and her husband Robert Taylor appearing to testify as what was termed friendly witnesses.<ref>Frost 2011, p. 127.</ref> Stanwyck shared conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] affiliation along with such contemporaries as [[Walt Disney]], [[Hedda Hopper]], [[Randolph Scott]], [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]], [[Ward Bond]],  [[William Holden]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Jimmy Stewart]], [[George Murphy]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[John Wayne]], [[Walter Brennan]], [[Shirley Temple]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], director [[Frank Capra]], and her ''Double Indemnity'' co-star, [[Fred McMurray]].<ref>Diorio 1984, p. 202.</ref><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001766/bio "Barbara Stanwyck biography."] ''IMDb.''

===Religion===
Stanwyck was a devout [[Protestant]] and was [[baptized]] in June 1916 by [[the Reverend]] J. Frederic Berg of the Protestant Dutch Reformed Church.<ref>Wilson [https://books.google.com/books?id=z43kS7QQOMkC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=Barbara+Stanwyck+Protestant&source=bl&ots=ZB_xm97652&sig=62ezfuU9soQ81FMlPl9JPYh2Iqs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3xvNVIGMEcqwyASsqIGgDQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Barbara%20Stanwyck%20Protestant&f=false 2013, p. 23.]</ref>

===Brother===
Her older brother, Malcolm Byron Stevens (1905-1964), also became a prolific actor, though a much less successful one. According to [[IMDb]], as Bert L. Stevens, he played hundreds of uncredited parts in film and television, but was only  credited in two television episodes.<ref>{{IMDb name|0828260|Bert L. Stevens}}</ref> He appeared in two films that starred his famous sibling: ''[[The File on Thelma Jordon]]'' and ''[[No Man of Her Own]]'', both released in 1950.

He and actress [[Caryl Lincoln]] married in 1934 and remained together until his death from a heart attack. They had one son, Brian.

==Later years and death==
Stanwyck's retirement years were active, with charity work outside the limelight. She was robbed and assaulted inside her Beverly Hills home in 1981. The following year, while filming ''[[The Thorn Birds (TV miniseries)|The Thorn Birds]]'', the inhalation of special-effects smoke on the set may have caused her to contract [[bronchitis]].
