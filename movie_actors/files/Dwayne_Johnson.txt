==== Rocky Maivia (1996–1997) ====
Johnson made his WWF debut as Rocky Maivia, a combination of his father and grandfather's ring names.

The Rock's entertaining promos and ensuing popularity led to a face turn, in which he called himself "The People's Champion".

At [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]] on January 23, 2000, The Rock entered the [[Royal Rumble match]] and was one of the final two remaining, along with Big Show.
