'''Li Lianjie''' ({{IPAc-cmn|l|i|3|-|l|ian|2|j|ie|2}}; born 26 April 1963),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.biography.com/people/jet-li-241077 | title=Biography.com | accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref> better known by his English stage name '''Jet Li''', is a Chinese film actor, film producer, [[Chinese martial arts|martial artist]], and [[wushu (sport)|wushu]] champion who was born in Beijing.  He is a naturalised Singaporean citizen.<ref name="news">{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/audio/2009-07/29/content_11789876.htm |title=Xinhuanet.com |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>

After three years of intensive training with [[Wu Bin (Wushu Coach)|Wu Bin]], Li won his first national championship for the Beijing Wushu Team. After retiring from Wushu at age 19, he went on to win great acclaim in China as an actor making his debut with the film ''[[Shaolin Temple (1982 film)|Shaolin Temple]]'' (1982). He went on to star in many critically acclaimed martial arts epic films, most notably the ''[[Once Upon a Time in China (film series)|Once Upon A Time in China]]'' series, in which he portrayed [[folk hero]] [[Wong Fei-hung]].

Li's first role in a Hollywood film was as a villain in ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'' (1998), and his first leading role in a Hollywood film was as Han Sing in ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'' (2000). He has gone on to star in many Hollywood action films, including ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Unleashed (film)|Unleashed]]''. He co-starred in ''[[The One (film)|The One]]''  (2001), ''[[The Forbidden Kingdom]]'' (2008) with [[Jackie Chan]], all three of ''[[The Expendables (film series)|The Expendables]]'' films with [[Sylvester Stallone]], and as the title character villain in ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'' (2008) opposite [[Brendan Fraser]].

==Early life and martial arts career==
Li was born in Beijing, China, as the youngest of two boys and two girls. His father died when he was two years old, leaving the family struggling.<ref name="personal-bio-1">{{cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=Let's start at the beginning|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=life&ss=essays&p=1|work=Essays|publisher=JetLi.com|accessdate=30 July 2010}}</ref>

Li was eight when his talent for wushu was noticed at a summer course at school, and he began his practice there.<ref name="personal-bio-2">{{cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=Life Essay: Part 2|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=life&ss=essays&p=2|work=Essays|publisher=JetLi.com|accessdate=30 July 2010}}</ref> Li participated in the sport of [[Wushu (sport)|wushu]] in the non-[[Sanshou|sparring]] event. He began his wushu on the [[Beijing Wushu Team]], an athletic group organised to perform martial arts forms during the [[National Games of the People's Republic of China|All China Games]]. He was coached by renowned wushu coaches [[Li Junfeng]] and [[Wu Bin (Wushu Coach)|Wu Bin]],<ref name="talktalk1">{{cite web|title=Jet Li Biography|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/jet-li/biography/51|publisher=TalkTalk|accessdate=30 July 2010}}</ref> who made extra efforts to help the talented boy develop. Wu Bin even bought food for Li's family because they could not afford to buy meat, which was essential for the good physical condition of an athlete.<ref name="talktalk1"/> As a member of the team, he received wushu training and went on to win fifteen gold medals and one silver medal in Chinese wushu championships, where, despite his young age, he competed against adults.<ref name="personal-bio-9">{{cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=Life Essay: Part 9|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=life&ss=essays&p=9|work=Essays|publisher=JetLi.com|accessdate=30 July 2010}}</ref>

According to Li, once, as a child, when the Chinese National Wushu Team went to perform for President [[Richard Nixon]] in the United States, he was asked by Nixon to be his personal bodyguard. Li replied, "I don't want to protect any individual. When I grow up, I want to defend my one billion Chinese countrymen!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jetli.com/jet/index.php?s=life&ss=essays&p=7 |title=LIFE ESSAY: PART 7 |publisher=Jetli.com |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>

Li is a master of several styles of wushu, especially [[Changquan]] (Northern Longfist Style) and [[Fanziquan]] (Tumbling fist). He has also studied other arts including [[Baguazhang]] (Eight trigram palm), [[Taijiquan]] (Supreme ultimate fist), [[Xingyiquan]] (Shape intent fist), [[Zuiquan]] (Drunken fist), [[Yingzhaoquan]] (Eagle claw fist) and [[Northern Praying Mantis (martial art)|Tanglangquan]] ([[Praying mantis]] fist). He did not learn [[Nanquan]] (Southern fist), because his training focused only in the Northern [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin]] Styles. He has also studied some of wushu's main weapons, such [[Three-section staff|Sanjiegun]] (Three section staff), [[Gun (staff)|Gun]], [[Dao (sword)|Dao]] (Broadsword), [[Jian]] (Straight sword) and many more.<ref name="wushuography">{{cite web|title=Wushu-ography|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?s=body&ss=wushuography&l=en|publisher=Jetli.com|accessdate=16 August 2010}}</ref>

It is Jet Li's authentic martial arts prowess that enabled his rise to domestic and international fame.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=YSjHUvePYVAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Celebrity+in+China+By+Louise+Edwards,+Elaine+Jeffreys&source=bl&ots=LWbTgHr1Gl&sig=vSwth0m-kWkXaFM0MYioj8LgfA4&hl=en&ei=NEehTMrvNIe3ccLhxcYB&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Jet Li: "Wushu Master" in Sport and Film in Celebrity in China |publisher=Books.google.com.au |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>

}}

The fame gained by his sports winnings led to a career as a martial arts film star, beginning in [[mainland China]] and then continuing into Hong Kong. Li acquired his screen name in 1982 in the Philippines when a publicity company thought his real name was too hard to pronounce. They likened his career to an aircraft, which likewise "takes-off" as quickly, so they placed the name Jet Li on the movie posters. Soon everybody was calling him by this new name, which was also based on the nickname, "Jet," given to him as a young student, due to his speed and grace when training with the Beijing Wushu team. He made his debut with the 1982 film ''[[Shaolin Temple (1982 film)|Shaolin Temple]]''. Some of his more famous Chinese films include:
* The ''[[Shaolin Temple (1982 film)|Shaolin Temple]]'' series (1, 2 and 3), which are considered to be the films which sparked the rebirth of the real [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin Temple]] in Dengfeng, China;
* The ''[[Once Upon a Time in China]]'' series (Chinese title: ''Wong Fei Hung''), about the legendary Chinese folk hero Master [[Wong Fei Hung]].
* ''[[Fist of Legend]]'' (Chinese title: ''Jing Wu Ying Xiong''), a remake of [[Bruce Lee]]'s ''[[Fist of Fury]].''
* The ''[[Fong Sai-yuk (film)|Fong Sai Yuk]]'' films about another Chinese folk hero.
Li starred in the 1995 film ''[[High Risk (1995 film)|High Risk]]'', where Jet Li plays a Captain who becomes disillusioned after his wife is murdered by crime lords. Along the way, he pairs up with a wacky sell-out actor, Frankie (played by [[Jacky Cheung]]), and proceeds to engage in a series of violent battles in a high-rise building. The setting is similar to that of ''[[Die Hard]]'' and both their Chinese film titles. This movie is notable in that director [[Wong Jing]] had such a terrible experience working with [[Jackie Chan]] in Jing's previous film ''[[City Hunter (film)|City Hunter]]'' that he chose to make Cheung's character a biting satire of Chan. Jet Li would later publicly apologise to Chan for taking part in it.

Li has two [[wuxia]] feature films scheduled for release in 2011, ''[[The Sorcerer and the White Snake]]'' and ''[[Flying Swords of Dragon Gate]]'', the latter is helmed by [[Tsui Hark]].

To promote tai chi, in 2012 Jet Li will star in a film titled ''Tai Chi'' and will co-produce the movie with Chen Kuo-Fu. Li will portray Tai Chi master [[Yang Lu-ch'an]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?jet_li_to_star_in_new_tai-chi_movie_16424.aspx | title = Jet Li to star in new tai-chi movie | publisher=Asia Pacific Arts | date = 23 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2011-05/20/content_22606294.htm|title='Tai Chi' releases concept poster|publisher=china.org.cn|accessdate=13 July 2011|date=20 May 2011}}</ref>

===American films===
In 1998, he made his American film debut in ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'' which also marked the first time he had ever played a villain in a film. He agreed to do ''Lethal Weapon 4'' after the producer [[Joel Silver]] promised to give him the leading role in his next film, ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'' (2000) alongside late singer [[Aaliyah]]. The film became a box office hit.

Li turned down [[Chow Yun-fat]]'s role in ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000) because he promised his wife that he would not make any films during her pregnancy.<ref>Burr, Martha. "Kiss of the Dragon."
''Kung Fu Magazine'' June 2001 [http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=311 KungFuMagazine.com], 13 February 2007</ref> He also turned down the role of [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]] in ''[[The Matrix]]'' trilogy, based on his belief that the role was not one which required his skills and that the films were iconic and stunning enough without adding his name to the cast list.

In 2001, he appeared in two more Hollywood films: ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]'', which was the first of his films with [[Jason Statham]], and ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'' opposite [[Bridget Fonda]] which did moderately well at the box office. In July 2001, Li agreed to produce and star in an action film with [[Jackie Chan]] which was to be released in 2002 or 2003, but no further news of their collaboration surfaced until 2006. In 2002, the period martial arts epic film ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' was released in the Chinese market. This film was both a commercial and critical success and became the highest-grossing motion picture in [[Cinema of China|Chinese film history]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2009/09-067.html|title=Special Screening of Historic Movie "Hero" at the Library Promotes Cultural Understanding|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref> In 2003 he reunited with producer Joel Silver for the action thriller film ''[[Cradle 2 the Grave]]'' where he starred alongside [[rapper]] [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]] and fellow martial artist [[Mark Dacascos]]. In 2004, Li lent his likeness, voice and provided motion capture work for the video game ''[[Jet Li: Rise to Honor]]''.

Li took on a more serious role in the 2005 film, ''[[Unleashed (film)|Unleashed]]'' (a.k.a. ''Danny the Dog''), where he portrayed an adult with the mentality of a child who has been raised like an animal. Although his martial arts skills were used extensively, it was a somber film with more depth than had been previously seen in Li's films, and co-starred dramatic actors [[Bob Hoskins]] and [[Morgan Freeman]].

In 2006, the [[martial arts film]] epic ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'', was released worldwide. Although he will continue to make martial arts films, ''Fearless'' is his last wushu epic.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=December 2013}} In ''Fearless'', he played [[Huo Yuanjia]], the real-life founder of [[Chin Woo Athletic Association]], who reportedly defeated foreign boxers and Japanese martial artists in publicised events at a time when China's power was seen as eroding. Together with the film ''[[Fist of Legend]]'', Li has portrayed both Chen Jun, the student and avenger of Huo Yuanjia (a.k.a. Fok Yun Gap), as well as Huo Yuanjia himself. ''Fearless'' was released on 26 January 2006 in Hong Kong, followed by a 22 September 2006 release in the United States where it reached second place in its first weekend.

{{quote|I stepped into the martial arts movie market when I was only 16. I think I have proved my ability in this field and it won't make sense for me to continue for another five or 10 years. Huo Yuanjia is a conclusion to my life as a martial arts star.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001472/bio Jet Li – Biography]</ref>}}

Li has stated in an interview with the ''Shenzhen Daily'' newspaper that this will be his last martial arts epic, which is also stated in the film's television promotions. However, he plans to continue his film career in other genres. Specifically, he plans to continue acting in action and martial arts films; epic films deal more with religious and philosophical issues.

Li's 2007 Hollywood film, ''[[War (2007 film)|War]]'', was released in August of that year, and re-teamed him with actor [[Jason Statham]], who previously starred with him in ''The One'', and action choreographer [[Corey Yuen]]. ''War'' raked in a disappointing $23&nbsp;million at the box office, becoming one of Li's lowest grossers in America; however, it was a hit on video, accumulating nearly $52&nbsp;million in rental revenue, more than doubling its box office take.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=homevideo&id=war07.htm |title=War Rental Revenue |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> With the exception of ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'' and the worldwide release of ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'', most of Li's American films have been only modest hits like ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'', ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]'', ''[[Unleashed (film)|Unleashed]]'', ''[[Cradle 2 the Grave]]'', and the worldwide release of ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]''.

In late 2007, Li returned again to China to participate in the China/Hong Kong co-production of the period war film ''[[The Warlords]]'' with [[Andy Lau]] and [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]]. This film with its focus on dramatics rather than martial arts netted Li the [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor]].

Li and fellow martial arts veteran [[Jackie Chan]] finally appeared together onscreen for the first time in ''[[The Forbidden Kingdom]]'', which began filming in May 2007 and was released to critical and commercial success on 18 April 2008. The film was based on the legend of the [[Monkey King]] from the Chinese folk novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jackiechan.com/blog/207242--Shooting-Begins |title=Shooting Begins |publisher=Jackiechan.com |date=1 May 2007 |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://movies.go.com/forbidden-kingdom/d922700/action Forbidden Kingdom Facts]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> Li also starred as the lead villain in the fantasy action film ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'' with actors [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Isabella Leong]] and [[Michelle Yeoh]].<ref>Chung, Philip W.

Retrieved on 4 August 2008.</ref>

After a one-year hiatus from filmmaking, Jet Li returned to acting in 2010, portraying a mercenary in the film ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'', teaming up with action stars [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Jason Statham]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Eric Roberts]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], [[Terry Crews]], and [[Randy Couture]]. It was the third time he had teamed up with Statham. In 2012, he reprised his role briefly in the sequel ''[[The Expendables 2]]'' and returned for the third film ''[[The Expendables 3]]'' in 2014.

According to Li, everything he has ever wanted to tell the world can be found in three of his films: the message of ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' is that the suffering of one person can never be as significant as the suffering of a nation; ''[[Unleashed (film)|Unleashed]]'' shows that violence is never a solution and ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]'' tells that the biggest enemy of a person is himself. Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love.<ref name="time">{{cite web|title=The Liberation of Jet Li|url=http://www.asianbite.com/default.asp?display=2304|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=8 August 2010|date=2 December 2008}}</ref>

About Wushu, Li said that he believes the essence of martial arts is not power or speed but inner harmony and considers it a sad development that today's Wushu championships place greater emphasis on form than on the essence of being a martial artist. He believes Wushu now lacks individuality and competitors move like machines, whereas according to his views Wushu should not be considered a race where the fastest athlete wins. He would like to see Wushu as a form of art, where artists have a distinctive style. Li blames the new competition rules that, according to him, place limitations on martial artists.<ref>{{cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=Wushu, Past and Present|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=body&ss=essays&p=1|work=Essays|publisher=jetli.com|accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref>

Li believes that Wushu is not primarily for self-defense and instead of trying to play the hero people should think about peaceful resolutions of conflicts and call the police if necessary: "A gun outdoes years of martial arts training in a split second. Like I've said many times before, it is important to differentiate between movies and reality. The hero in movies may be able to knock the gun off his opponent and save the day, but in real life – probably that is not the case."<ref>{{cite web|last=Li|first=Jet|title=The definition of Wushu – Part 2|url=http://jetli.com/jet/index.php?l=en&s=body&ss=essays&p=3|work=Essays|publisher=Jetli.com|accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> He has also stated that he has never had to use his martial arts skills in a real life fight and he does not wish to, either.<ref name="fight"/>

===Philanthropy===
Li has been a "philanthropic ambassador" of the [[Red Cross Society of China]] since January 2006. He contributed 500,000 yuan (US$62,500) of box office revenues from his film ''Fearless'' to the Red Cross' psychological sunshine project, which promotes mental health.<ref>"Jet Li Becomes 'Philanthropic Ambassador' of Red Cross."  Xinhua News Agency. 23 January 2006. [http://china.org.cn/english/features/film/155991.htm China.org.cn]</ref>

In April 2007, touched by his life-shaking experience in the Maldives when he was close to dying during the 2004 tsunami, Li formed his own non-profit foundation called [[One Foundation|The One Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/01/08/talkasia.jetli/index.html |title=Interview with Jet Li |publisher=CNN  |date=24 September 2008 |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onefoundation.cn/ |title=The One Foundation |publisher=Onefoundation.cn |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> The One Foundation supports international disaster relief efforts in conjunction with the Red Cross as well as other efforts, including mental health awareness and suicide prevention. Since the starting of the foundation, Li has been involved with recovery efforts in seven disasters, including the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]<ref name="newsweek.com"/> and [[Typhoon Morakot]] in Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/17/content_11899532.htm |title=Chinese mainland to hold television fundraiser for Taiwan typhoon relief |publisher=xinhuanet.com.|accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref> In the [[2013 Lushan earthquake]] in [[Ya'an]], Sichuan, Li and other members of the entertainment sector were the first to appeal for donations of money, goods and materials to help the victims of the disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onefoundation.cn/ |title=The One Foundation |publisher=Onefoundation.cn |accessdate=3 May 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/special/lushandizhen/content-3/detail_2013_04/21/24457577_0.shtml]</ref> [[Wu Jing (actor)|Wu Jing]] was a One Foundation volunteer and helped in the effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/516-Wu-Jing-Gives-a-Helping-Hand-in-Sichuan.html |title=Wu Jing Gives a Helping Hand in Sichuan |publisher=Wu-Jing.org |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>

Li discussed his commitment to philanthropy in an interview with the December 2009 issue of Alliance magazine, stating that "grassroots non-government organizations can help the government in its blind spots. Government relief is not always detail-oriented. Grassroots NGOs can't be as big as a government effort, but they need to be flexible and independent."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alliancemagazine.org/en/content/interview-jet-li |title=Interview – Jet Li &#124; |publisher=Alliancemagazine.org |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>

In September 2010, Jet Li was appointed by the International Red Cross as the first Good Will Ambassador. He posted online saying "Today I signed a deal with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies – IFRC – to become the FIRST goodwill ambassador in the history of this humanitarian organization. I am very honored! At the same time, I will not pause to celebrate, but instead keep pushing forward and do my best to help the world! Thank you all once again for your support and belief in me!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alivenotdead.com/jetli/International-Federation-of-Red-Cross-and-Red-Crescent-Societies-profile-1078102.html |title=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies |publisher=alivenotdead.com |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>

It was also announced in September 2010, when Li attended to his wax unveiling ceremony in Hong Kong Madame Tussauds, he mentioned that he would be meeting Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to talk about charity work.<ref>[http://yule.sohu.com/20100929/n275336232.shtml]</ref> "Three days ago, I received an email from Gates, hoping I could make time because he and Buffett hoped I could go for a 30-minute chat before the dinner about the future we face as human beings, so I will go," Li said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i1gBUT-Z9nphtUn--SyTzZ4CzVKg |title=China film star Jet Li to meet Gates, Buffett |publisher=Google  |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref>

===Taiji Zen===

Jet Li founded Taiji Zen in 2011, along with co-founder Executive chairman [[Jack Ma]].  Taiji Zen is a lifestyle company with the mission of spreading "Health and Happiness for All" through a balance of physical wellness and mental fitness.  Taiji Zen combined the martial art of [[Taijiquan]] (a.k.a. T'ai Chi Chuan) with mindfulness based practices such as [[meditation]].  It packaged these art forms into several different classes and online programs.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is Taiji Zen?|url=http://www.taijizen.com/en/singlepage.html?11_3#.UqeMOFbkrCE|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228064119/http://www.taijizen.com/en/singlepage.html?11_3#.UqeMOFbkrCE|archivedate=February 28, 2014|accessdate=April 15, 2015}}</ref>
