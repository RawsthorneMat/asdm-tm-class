==Biography==

===Early years===
Though born '''Curtis Wain Gates''' in [[Lamar, Colorado|Lamar]] in [[Prowers County, Colorado|Prowers County]] in southeastern [[Colorado]], Curtis was reared west of there in [[Las Animas, Colorado|Las Animas]], the seat of [[Bent County, Colorado|Bent County]]. His father, Dan Gates, was the Bent County [[sheriff]].<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/106_CurtisQuarterBack.htm] "Ken Curtis's father was sheriff of Bent County, Colorado," GunsmokeNet.com.</ref> The family lived above the jail and his mother, Nellie Sneed Gates, cooked for the prisoners. The jail is now located for historical preservation purposes on the grounds of the Bent County courthouse in Las Animas.

Curtis played [[quarterback]] for his high school [[American football|football]] team. During World War II, Curtis served in the United States Army. (1943–1945)

===Career===
[[File:Ken Curtis James Arness Gunsmoke 1968.JPG|thumb|left|270px|Ken Curtis as [[Festus Haggen]] and [[James Arness]] as [[Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke)|Matt Dillon]], 1968]]
Curtis was a singer before moving into acting<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/102-FestusSings.htm] "Ken Curtis had a great singing voice," GunsmokeNet.com.</ref> and combined both careers once he entered films, performing with the popular [[Sons of the Pioneers]] from 1949 to 1953 as well as singing with the [[Tommy Dorsey]] band. Curtis replaced [[Frank Sinatra]] as vocalist for the Dorsey band.  He was with the Dorsey band in 1941, prior to Sinatra's departure, and may have served simply as insurance against Sinatra's likely defection. [[Dick Haymes]] contractually replaced Sinatra, in 1942. Curtis then joined [[Shep Fields]] and His New Music, an all-reeds band that dispensed with a brass section.

[[Columbia Pictures]] signed Curtis to a contract in 1945. He starred in a series of musical westerns<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/95-Cheesy.htm] "Ken Curtis appeared in a number of cheesy movies," GunsmokeNet.com.</ref> with [[The Hoosier Hot Shots]], playing singing-cowboy romantic leads. For much of 1948, Curtis was a featured singer and host of the long-running country music radio program ''[[WWVA Jamboree]]''.

Ken Curtis joined the Sons of the Pioneers (the foremost western vocal group in history) as a lead singer from 1949 to 1952. His big hits with the group included "Room Full of Roses" and "(Ghost) Riders in the Sky".
   
Through his first marriage, Curtis was a son-in-law of director [[John Ford]]. Curtis teamed with Ford and [[John Wayne]] in ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]'',{{citation needed|reason=Not too sure this statement is correct; Curtis is not listed as a member of the principal cast. It's possible that he played a bit part, however Curtis is best remembered as Charlie McCorry in The Searchers|date=July 2012}} ''[[The Quiet Man]]'', ''[[The Wings of Eagles]]'', ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', ''[[The Horse Soldiers]]'', ''[[The Alamo (1960 film)|The Alamo]]'' and ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How The West Was Won]]''. Curtis also joined Ford, along with [[Henry Fonda]], [[James Cagney]], [[William Powell]], and [[Jack Lemmon]] in the comedy [[United States Navy|Navy]] classic ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]''. He was featured in all three of the only films produced by [[Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney]]'s C. V. Whitney Pictures: ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956); ''[[The Missouri Traveler]]'' (1958) with [[Brandon deWilde]] and [[Lee Marvin]]; and ''[[The Young Land]]'' (1959) with [[Patrick Wayne]] and [[Dennis Hopper]]. ''[[5 Steps to Danger]]'' (1957 film) (uncredited) as FBI Agent Jim Anderson. Curtis also produced two extremely low-budget monster films, ''[[The Killer Shrews]]'' and ''[[The Giant Gila Monster]].''

Curtis guest-starred five times on the TV Series Western ''[[Have Gun Will Travel]]''. He also guest-starred as circus performer Tim Durant on an episode of ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', "The Case of the Clumsy Clown", which aired on November 5, 1960. Then he co-starred with [[Larry Pennell]] in the 1961–1963 first-run syndicated television series ''[[Ripcord (TV series)|Ripcord]]'', a half-hour action/adventure show on a [[skydiving]] service company of its namesake. Curtis played the role of Jim Buckley and Pennell was his young disciple Ted McKeever. This program helped generate interest in sport [[parachuting]].

Curtis remains best known for his role as Festus, the scruffy, cantankerous and illiterate deputy in ''[[Gunsmoke]].'' While [[Marshal Matt Dillon]] had a total of five helpers over two decades, Festus held the role the longest (11 years), in 239 episodes, and was the most colorful. Festus was patterned after "Cedar Jack", a man from Curtis' Las Animas childhood. Cedar Jack, who lived about forty miles out of town, made a living cutting [[Eastern Red Cedar|cedar]] fence posts. Curtis observed many times that Jack would come to Las Animas, where he would usually end up drunk and in jail.  Festus' character was known, in part, for his nasally, twangy, rural accent which Curtis developed for the role, but which did not reflect Curtis' actual voice.

Besides engaging in the usual personal appearances most television stars undertake to promote their program, Curtis also traveled around the country performing a western-themed stage show at fairs, rodeos and other venues when ''Gunsmoke'' wasn't in production, and even for some years after the show was canceled.

In two episodes of ''Gunsmoke'', [[Carroll O'Connor]] was a guest-star; years later Curtis guest-starred as a retired police detective on O'Connor's [[NBC]] program ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]''. He voiced Nutsy the vulture in Disney's 1973 animated film ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''. A decade later, he returned to television in the short-lived western series ''[[The Yellow Rose]]'', in which he performed most of his scenes with [[Noah Beery, Jr.]].

===Last years===
In 1981, Curtis was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].

Curtis' last acting role was as the aging cattle rancher "Seaborn Tay" in the television production ''[[Conagher]]'' (1991), by western author [[Louis L'Amour]]. [[Sam Elliott]] starred in the lead role, and Curtis' ''Gunsmoke'' costar [[Buck Taylor]] (Newly O'Brien) played a bad man in the same film. Buck Taylor's father, [[Dub Taylor]], had a minor role in it. He joined the ''Gunsmoke'' cast in 1967, superseding the previous deputy, Thaddeus "Thad" Greenwood, played by [[Roger Ewing]].

A statue of Ken Curtis as Festus can be found at 430 Pollasky Avenue in [[Clovis, California]] in [[Fresno County, California|Fresno County]] in front of the Educational Employees Credit Union. In his later years, Curtis resided in Clovis.<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/109_FestusStatue.htm] "Ken Curtis statue," GunsmokeNet.com</ref>

==Death==

Curtis died in his sleep of a heart attack in [[Clovis, California|Fresno]], California.<ref>[http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/festus-dead.htm] Ken Curtis Obituary, LA Times, GunsmokeNet.com</ref> He was [[cremation|cremated]], and his ashes were scattered in the [[Colorado]] flatlands.
