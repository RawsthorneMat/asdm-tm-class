==Career==
Reitman's first producing job was with the then-new station [[CITY-TV]] in Toronto. CITY was also the home of the first announcing job of his later friend and collaborator [[Dan Aykroyd]].

In Toronto, he produced the stage production ''Spellbound'' (1973) which evolved into Broadway production ''[[The Magic Show]]''.

Reitman's first commercial film ventures were as producer of two films for director [[David Cronenberg]], [[Shivers (film)|''Shivers''/''They Came from Within''/''The Parasite Murders'']] (1974) and ''[[Rabid]]'' (1976). His big break came when he produced ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' in 1978 and directed ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' in 1979. From there, he directed and produced a number of comedies including ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' (1981), ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35332/ghostbusters-3-director-confirmed|title=Ghostbusters 3 Director Confirmed!}}</ref> ''[[Legal Eagles]]'' (1986), ''[[Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]'' (1988), ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' (1989),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18693|title=Ivan Reitman Verbally Confirms He'll Direct 'Ghostbusters 3'}}</ref> ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990), ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'' (1993), ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]]'' (1994), ''[[Six Days Seven Nights]]'' (1998), ''[[Evolution (film)|Evolution]]'' (2001), ''[[My Super Ex-Girlfriend]]'' (2006), and ''[[No Strings Attached (film)|No Strings Attached]]'' (2011).
