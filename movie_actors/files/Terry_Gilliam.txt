'''Terence Vance''' "'''Terry'''" '''Gilliam''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɪ|l|i|ə|m}}; born 22 November 1940) is an American-born British screenwriter, film director, animator, actor, and member of the [[Monty Python]] comedy troupe.

Gilliam has directed 12 feature films, including ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981), ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' (1988),  ''[[The Fisher King]]'' (1991), ''[[12 Monkeys]]'' (1995), ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]'' (2009). The only "Python" not born in Britain, he became a naturalised British citizen in 1968 and formally [[Renunciation of citizenship|renounced]] his American citizenship in 2006.

==Early life==
Gilliam was born in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota, the son of Beatrice (née Vance) and James Hall Gilliam. His father was a travelling salesman for [[Folgers]] before becoming a carpenter. Soon after, they moved to nearby [[Medicine Lake, Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Pythons: Autobiography by The Pythons|year=2005|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|location=New York|isbn=978-0312311452}}</ref>

The family moved to the Los Angeles neighbourhood of [[Panorama City, Los Angeles|Panorama City]] in 1952. Gilliam attended [[Birmingham High School]] where he was class president and senior prom king. He was voted "Most Likely to Succeed", and achieved straight A's. During high school, he began to avidly read ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, then edited by [[Harvey Kurtzman]], which would later influence Gilliam's work.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gilliam|first1=Terry|last2=Sterritt|first2=David| authorlink2=David Sterritt|last3=Rhodes|first3=Lucille|title=Terry Gilliam: interviews|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8eDE0hce0kEC&pg=PA65|accessdate=7 October 2010|date=April 2004|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-57806-624-7|page=67|quote=''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' comics inspired everything we ever did. (p. 67)}}</ref>

Gilliam later spoke to [[Salman Rushdie]] about defining experiences in the 1960s that would set the foundations for his views on the world, later influencing his art and career:
{{cquote|I became terrified that I was going to be a full-time, bomb-throwing terrorist if I stayed [in the U.S.] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles. [...] In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way. [...] And I drove around this little English [[Hillman Minx]]—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop. [...]<br>And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.<ref name="rushdie">[http://www.believermag.com/issues/200303/?read=interview_gilliam "Salman Rushdie talks with Terry Gilliam"], ''The Believer'', March 2003</ref>}}

Gilliam graduated from [[Occidental College]] in 1962 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Political Science.<ref name="NNDB">{{nndb|241/000024169/}}</ref><ref name="OXY">[https://www.oxy.edu/news/terry-gilliam-62-honored-british-film-academy "Terry Gilliam '62 Honored by British Film Academy"], ''Oxy'', Occidental College, 9 February 2009</ref>

==Career==
===Animations===
Gilliam started his career as an animator and [[Cartoonist|strip cartoonist]]. One of his early [[Photonovel|photographic strips]] for ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]'' featured future Python cast member [[John Cleese]]. When ''Help!'' folded, Gilliam went to Europe, jokingly announcing in the very last issue that he was "being transferred to the European branch" of the magazine,<ref name="rushdie" /> which, of course, did not exist. Moving to England, he animated sequences for the children's series ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', which also featured [[Eric Idle]], [[Terry Jones]], and [[Michael Palin]].

===Monty Python===
Gilliam was a part of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' from its outset, at first credited as an animator (his name was listed separately after the other five in the closing credits), later as a full member. His cartoons linked the show's sketches together, and defined the group's visual language in other media (such as LP and book covers, and the title sequences of their films). Gilliam's animations mix his own art, characterised by soft gradients and odd, bulbous shapes, with backgrounds and moving cutouts from antique photographs, mostly from the [[Victorian era]].

In 1978, Gilliam published a book called ''Animations of Mortality'', which was an illustrated tongue-in-cheek, semi-autobiographical how-to guide to his animation techniques and visual language in them.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Animations-Mortality-Terry-Gilliam/dp/0413393801 ''Animations of Mortality''] on Amazon.com</ref><ref>[http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/tgbooks.htm ''Dreams: Terry Gilliam Books''], on ''Dreams: The Terry Gilliam fanzine''</ref> Roughly 15 years later, between the release of the ''[[Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time]]'' CD-ROM game in 1994 which used many of Gilliam's animation templates, and the making of Gilliam's film ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1998), Gilliam was in negotiations with one software company called ''Enteractive, Inc.'' to tentatively release in the autumn of 1996 a CD-ROM under the same title as his 1978 book, containing all of his thousands of 1970s animation templates as free license [[clip art]]s for people to create their own [[flash animation]]s out of them, but the project hovered in limbo for years,<ref>Cate, Hans ten (1996) [http://www.dailyllama.com/news/1996/llama020.html ''"ANIMATIONS OF MORTALITY:" TERRY GILLIAM'S NEW INTERACTIVE CD-ROM GAME''], on ''Monty Python's Daily Llama'', 16 January 1996</ref><ref name="TGinterviews">Sterrit, David; Rhodes, Lucille (publ., 2004). [http://books.google.de/books?id=8eDE0hce0kEC&pg=PR13&lpg=PR13&dq=%22animations+of+mortality%22+%22CD+rom%22&source=bl&ots=2VUOGt80qX&sig=vq_LUAFPVSjLl3lNrsrJ0FrmRro&hl=de&sa=X&ei=hDOeU8qbDuSP7Abtu4B4&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22animations%20of%20mortality%22%20%22CD%20rom%22&f=false ''Terry Gilliam: Interviews''], Uiv. Press of Mississippi, 2004</ref> probably because Enteractive was about to downsize critically in mid-1996 and later change its focus from CD-ROM multimedia presentations to internet business solutions and web hosting in 1997<ref>Entry for [http://www.mobygames.com/company/enteractive-inc ''Enteractive, Inc.''] on MobyGames.com</ref> (in the introduction to their 2004 book ''Terry Gilliam: Interviews'',<ref name="TGinterviews" /> David Sterrit and Lucille Rhodes cited "the internet" overwhelming "the computer-communications market" as reason for why the ''Animations of Mortality'' CD-ROM had never materialised). Around the time of Gilliam's film ''[[The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]'' (2009), the project had morphed into the idea of releasing his 1970s animation templates as a free license download of [[Adobe After Effects]] files or similar.

Besides doing the animations, he also appeared in several sketches, though he rarely had any main roles and did considerably less acting in the sketches. He did however have some notable sketch roles such as Cardinal Fang of [[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|the Spanish Inquisition]], the bespectacled commenter who said "I can't add anything to that!" from the [[Election Night Special]] sketch, Kevin Garibaldi (the brat on the couch shouting "I want more beans!" from "Most Awful Family in Britain 1974", Episode 45) and the Screaming Queen in a cape and mask singing "Ding dong merrily on high." More frequently, he played parts that no one else wanted to play (generally because they required a lot of make-up or uncomfortable costumes, such as a recurring knight in armour who would end sketches by walking on and hitting one of the other characters over the head with a plucked chicken) and took a number of small roles in the films, including [[Patsy (Monty Python)|Patsy]] in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (which he co-directed with [[Terry Jones]], where Gilliam was responsible for photography, while Jones would guide the actors' performances) and the jailer in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]''.

===Directing===
With the gradual break-up of the Python troupe between ''Life of Brian'' in 1979 and ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life|The Meaning of Life]]'' in 1983, Gilliam became a screenwriter and director, building upon the experience he had acquired during the making of ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail''. Gilliam says he used to think of his films in terms of trilogies, starting with ''Time Bandits'' in 1981. The 1980s saw Gilliam's self-written ''Trilogy of Imagination'' about "the ages of man" in ''Time Bandits'' (1981), ''Brazil'' (1985), and ''The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' (1988). All are about the "craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible."<ref name="essay">Matthews, Jack (1996). ''Dreaming Brazil'' (essay accompanying [[The Criterion Collection]] DVD release).</ref> All three movies focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination; ''Time Bandits'', through the eyes of a child, ''Brazil'', through the eyes of a thirty-something, and ''Munchausen'', through the eyes of an elderly man.

Throughout the 1990s, Gilliam directed his ''Trilogy of Americana'': ''The Fisher King'' (1991), ''12 Monkeys'' (1995), and ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' (1998), which played on North American soil, and while still being surreal, had less fantastical plots than his previous trilogy.<ref>Pirie, Chris (2002).

===Themes and philosophy===
{{quote|Well, I really want to encourage a kind of fantasy, a kind of magic. I love the term [[magic realism]], whoever invented it&nbsp;– I do actually like it because it says certain things. It's about expanding how you see the world. I think we live in an age where we're just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world is. Television's saying, everything's saying 'That's the world.' And it's not the world. The world is a million possible things.|Terry Gilliam: ''Salman Rushdie talks with Terry Gilliam''<ref name="rushdie" />}}

As for his philosophical background in screenwriting and directing, Gilliam said on the TV show ''[[First Hand]]{{disambiguation needed|date=July 2012}}'' on RoundhouseTV: "There's so many film schools, so many media courses which I actually am opposed to. Because I think it's more important to be educated, to read, to learn things, because if you're gonna be in the media and if you'll have to say things, you have to ''know'' things. If you only know about cameras and 'the media', what're you gonna be talking about except cameras and the media? So it's better learning about philosophy and art and architecture ''[and]'' literature, these are the things to be concentrating on it seems to me. Then, you can ''fly...!''"<ref>{{YouTube|1v7YjOCC-cM|Terry Gilliam}} on ''RoundhouseTV'', uploaded by RoundhouseTV themselves</ref>

His films are usually highly imaginative [[fantasy|fantasies]]. His long-time co-writer Charles McKeown comments about Gilliam's recurring interests, "the theme of imagination, and the importance of imagination, to how you live and how you think and so on ''[...]'' that's very much a Terry theme."<ref>Stubbs, Phil (2008). [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/parncmck.htm ''Charles McKeown on writing the ''Dr Parnassus'' script''], Dreams</ref> Most of Gilliam's movies include plot-lines that seem to occur partly or completely in the characters' imaginations, raising questions about the definition of [[Personal identity|identity]] and sanity. He often shows his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarian regimes. He also distinguishes "higher" and "lower" layers of society, with a disturbing and ironic style. His movies usually feature a fight or struggle against a great power which may be an emotional situation, a human-made [[Cult image|idol]], or even the person himself, and the situations do not always end happily. There is often a dark, [[paranoia|paranoid]] atmosphere and unusual characters who formerly were normal members of society. His scripts feature [[black comedy]] and often end with a dark [[tragicomedy|tragicomic]] twist.

As Gilliam is fascinated with the [[Baroque]] due to the historical age's pronounced struggle between spirituality and logical rationality,<ref>"The clash between the baroque and the Newtonian view of the world is my message in a bottle.", [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/bmfact.htm ''Dreams: The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'']</ref><ref name="hamel">"In Weber's view, the technological world of modernity tries to eliminate any need for magic, fantasy, or any irrational forces. Gilliam presents this idea of change 'from without' through certain aspects of his mise-en-scene.", Hamel, Keith James. [http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue06/features/brazil.htm ''Modernity and Mise-en-scene: Terry Gilliam and ''Brazil], from ''Images: Journal of Film and Popular Culture'', issue 6</ref> there is often a rich baroqueness and dichotomous eclecticity about his movies, with, for instance, high-tech computer monitors equipped with low-tech magnifying lenses in ''Brazil'', and in ''[[The Fisher King]]'' a red [[knight]] covered with flapping bits of cloth. He also is given to incongruous juxtapositions of beauty and ugliness, or antique and modern. Regarding Gilliam's theme of modernity's struggle between spirituality and rationality whereas the individual may become dominated by a tyrannical, soulless machinery of [[Disenchantment|disenchanted]] society, film critic Keith James Hamel observed a specific affinity of Gilliam's movies with the writings of economic historian [[Arnold Toynbee]] and sociologist [[Max Weber]], specifically the latter's concept of the ''[[Iron cage]]'' of modern rationality.<ref name="hamel" />

===Look and style===
[[File:Terry Gilliam(CannesPhotoCall).jpg|thumb|upright|Terry Gilliam at Cannes, 2001]]
Gilliam's films have a distinctive look not only in ''[[mise-en-scene]]'' but even more so in photography, often recognisable from just a short clip; to create a surreal atmosphere of psychological unrest and a world out-of-balance, Gilliam frequently uses unusual camera angles, particularly [[low-angle shot]]s, [[high-angle shot]]s, and [[Dutch angle]]s. [[Roger Ebert]] has said "his world is always [[hallucination|hallucinatory]] in its richness of detail."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050825/REVIEWS/50822002/1023 |title=The Brothers Grimm Review |work=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=1 June 2011 |first=Chaz's |last=Blog}}</ref> Most of his movies are shot almost entirely with [[rectilinear lens|rectilinear]] [[ultra wide angle lens]]es of 28&nbsp;mm [[focal length]] or less to achieve a distinctive signature style defined by extreme [[perspective distortion (photography)|perspective distortion]] and extremely [[deep focus]]. Gilliam's long-time director of photography [[Nicola Pecorini]] has said, "with Terry and me, a long lens means something between a 40mm and a 65mm."<ref>Stubbs, Phil (2011). [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/wholnico.htm ''Dreams: Nicola Pecorini on'' The Wholly Family], Dreams: The Terry Gilliam Fanzine</ref> This attitude markedly differs from the common definition in photography which qualifies 40mm to 65mm as the focal length of a [[normal lens]] instead due to resembling natural human [[field of view]], unlike Gilliam's signature style defined by extreme perspective distortion due to his usual choice of focal length. In fact, over the years, the 14mm lens has become informally known as "The Gilliam" among film-makers due to the director's frequent use of it since at least ''Brazil''.<ref>Stubbs, Phil: [http://www.smart.co.uk/dreams/tidegill.htm "Terry Gilliam talks ''Tideland''," ''Dreams'']</ref> Gilliam has explained his preference for using wide-angle lenses in his films:

{{quote|The wide-angle lenses, I think I choose them because it makes me feel like I'm in the space of the film, I'm surrounded. My prevalent vision is full of detail, and that's what I like about it. It's actually harder to do, it's harder to light. The other thing I like about wide-angle lenses is that I'm not forcing the audience to look at just the one thing that is important. It's there, but there's other things to occupy, and some people don't like that because I'm not pointing things out as precisely as I could if I was to use a long lens where I'd focus just on the one thing and everything else would be out of focus. [...]<br>
[M]y films, I think, are better the second and third time, frankly, because you can now relax and go with the flow that may not have been as apparent as the first time you saw it and wallow in the details of the worlds we're creating. [...] I try to clutter [my visuals] up, they're worthy of many viewings.<ref>Bianculli, David (2009).

In another interview, Gilliam mentioned, in relation to the 9.8mm Kinoptic lens he had first used on ''Brazil'', that wide-angle lenses make small film sets "look big".<ref>Sheehan, Henry (2006).

===Production problems===
[[File:Terry Gilliam at IFC Center 2006.jpg|thumb|Terry Gilliam at an [[IFC Center]] on 4 October 2006]]
Gilliam has made a few extremely expensive movies beset with production problems. After the lengthy quarrelling with [[Universal Studios]] over ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', Gilliam's next picture, ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', cost around US$46&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=adventuresofbaronmunchausen.htm |title=Box Office Mojo |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=20 June 1989 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref> and then earned only about US$8&nbsp;million in US ticket sales. The film saw no wide domestic release from [[Columbia Pictures]], which was in the process of being sold at the time.

In the mid-1990s, Gilliam and [[Charles McKeown]] developed a script for ''Time Bandits 2'', a project that never came to be made. Several of the original actors had died. Gilliam also attempted to direct a version of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', which collapsed due to disagreements over its budget and choice of lead actor.<ref>{{cite book

In 1999, Gilliam attempted to film ''[[The Man Who Killed Don Quixote]]'', budgeted at US$32.1&nbsp;million, among the highest-budgeted films to use only European financing; but in the first week of shooting, the actor playing [[Don Quixote]] ([[Jean Rochefort]]) suffered a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]], and a flood severely damaged the set. The film was cancelled, resulting in an insurance claim of US$15&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book

Gilliam has attempted twice to adapt [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Watchmen]]'' comics into a [[Watchmen (film)|film]]. Both attempts (in 1989 and 1996) were unsuccessful. Most recently, unforeseeable problems again befell a Gilliam project when actor [[Heath Ledger]] died in New York City during the filming of ''[[The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]''.

===Box office===
On the other hand, Gilliam's first successful feature, ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981), earned more than eight times its original budget in the United States alone; Gilliam's infamous box office flop ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' (1988) was nevertheless nominated for four [[Academy Award]]s (and won, among other European prizes, three [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]]); his $24&nbsp;million-budgeted film ''[[The Fisher King]]'' (1991) (his first film not to feature a member from Python) grossed more than $41&nbsp;million at United States box office; and ''[[12 Monkeys]]'' went on to take over US$168&nbsp;million worldwide; whilst ''[[The Brothers Grimm (film)|The Brothers Grimm]]'', despite a mixed critical reception, grossed over US$105&nbsp;million worldwide. Gilliam's $30&nbsp;million-budgeted film ''[[The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]'' had also became an international box office success, grossing over $60&nbsp;million in worldwide theatrical release.
According to [[Box Office Mojo]], his films have grossed an average of $26,009,723.

===Recurring collaborators===
Since his first feature, Gilliam has shown a propensity to work with particular actors in numerous productions. Up until the 1990s, each of Gilliam's non-Python films has featured at least one of his fellow Monty Python alumni (particularly Palin, Cleese, and Idle), and for his finished projects Gilliam has worked with the following actors at least twice (in order of first film appearance):

===Gilliam and ''Harry Potter''===
[[J. K. Rowling]], author of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, is a fan of Gilliam's work. Consequently, he was Rowling's first choice to direct ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' in 2000, but [[Warner Bros.]] ultimately chose [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] for the job.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000416/bio IMDb: Biography for Terry Gilliam]. Retrieved 22 April 2007.</ref> In response to this decision, Gilliam expressed that "I was the perfect guy to do ''Harry Potter''. I remember leaving the meeting, getting in my car, and driving for about two hours along [[Mulholland Drive]] just so angry. I mean, Chris Columbus' versions are terrible. Just dull. Pedestrian."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wizardnews.com/story.20050829.html |title=Terry Gilliam Bitter About Potter |publisher=Wizardnews.com |date=29 August 2005 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref> In 2006, Gilliam added that he found [[Alfonso Cuarón]]'s ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' to be "really good...much closer to what I would've done."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1543143/terry-gilliam-tilts-at-hollywood-yet-again.jhtml |title=Terry Gilliam Tilts at Hollywood Yet Again |publisher=MTV |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> In retrospect, however, Gilliam has stated that he wouldn't have liked to direct any [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Potter'' film]]. In a 2005 interview with ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine, he said that he would not enjoy working on such an expensive project due to interference from studio executives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/gilliam%20vows%20never%20to%20direct%20harry%20potter |title=Gilliam Vows Never To Direct Harry Potter |publisher=Contactmusic.com |accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref>

In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1]]'', director [[David Yates]] paid homage to Gilliam's 1985 film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', portraying the Death Eater-infiltrated Ministry of Magic in a fashion reminiscent of Gilliam's totalitarian bureaucracy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/jkrowlingharrypotter/Review-Harry-Potter-and-the.6629159.jp |title=Review: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&nbsp;– Part One  |work=The Scotsman |location=UK |accessdate=12 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-1-review-a-second-opinion/ |title=Review: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 Review |publisher=We Got This Covered (Movies)|accessdate=12 April 2011}}</ref>

===''Secret Tournament''===
In 2002, Gilliam directed a series of television advertisements called ''[[Secret Tournament]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A776009 |title='The Secret Tournament'&nbsp;– the Nike World Cup 2002 Advert |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2002 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref> The advertisements were part of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s [[FIFA World Cup]] campaign, and featured a secret three-on-three tournament between the world's best football players inside a huge tanker ship, with the [[Elvis Presley]] song "[[A Little Less Conversation]]" playing during the advertisements.

===''Slava's Diabolo''===
[[File:Terry Gilliam KVIFF.jpg|thumb|right|Gilliam at the 41st Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, April 2006]]
In 2006, Gilliam directed the stage show ''Slava's Diabolo'' created and staged by Russian [[clown]] artist [[Slava Polunin]]. The show combines Polunin's clown style, characterised by deep non-verbal expression and interaction with the audience, with Gilliam's rich visuals and surrealistic imagery. The show premiered at the Noga hall of the Gesher theatre in [[Jaffa]], Israel.

===''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus''===
''[[The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]'', directed and co-written by Gilliam, was released in 2009.<ref>{{Cite news| author=Shawn Adler | url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/11/15/ledger-a-big-joker-when-it-comes-to-new-gilliam-film/ | title=Ledger A Big Joker When It Comes To New Gilliam Film | publisher=MTV | date=15 November 2007 | accessdate=30 December 2007 }}</ref> In January 2007, Gilliam announced that he had been working on a new project with writing partner Charles McKeown.

In July 2012, Gilliam revealed plans for a future film, which would be shot in [[Bucharest]], Romania, but although he denied that it would be ''Don Quixote'', he refused to give any details.<ref>Lyman, Eric.

===Opera director===
Gilliam made his opera debut at London's [[English National Opera]] (ENO) in May 2011, directing ''[[The Damnation of Faust]]'' by [[Hector Berlioz]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Damnation of Faust|publisher=ENO|url=http://www.eno.org/see-whats-on/productions/production-page.php?&itemid=1087|accessdate =23 October 2010}}</ref> The production received positive reviews in the British press<ref>{{cite news|title=Terry Gilliam's first opera is a damned fine glimpse of the abyss|author=Rupert Christiansen |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/8502174/The-Damnation-of-Faust-ENO-Coliseum-review.html|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=9 May 2011|accessdate=10 May 2011|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The Damnation of Faust&nbsp;– review|author=Andrew Clements|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/may/07/the-damnation-of-faust-review|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 May 2011|accessdate=10 May 2011|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The Damnation of Faust, English National Opera|author=Jessica Duchen|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/reviews/the-damnation-of-faust-english-national-opera-2281533.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=9 May 2011|accessdate=10 May 2011|location=London}}</ref> On 16 September 2012, the production opened at the [[Vlaamse Opera]] in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]], in the opera's original French-language version and received praise from critics and audiences alike. After a number of performances in Ghent, the production moved to the opera house in [[Antwerp]] for sold-out run of performances.

In June 2014, Gilliam followed up on his success with ''Faust'' with a new ENO production of another opera by Berlioz, the rarely performed ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]''.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b047zky8 Opera on 3 – Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini], broadcast on [[BBC Radio 3]] (30 June 2014)</ref>

===Projects in development or shelved===
Gilliam has several projects in various states of development, including an adaptation of [[Neil Gaiman]]'s and [[Terry Pratchett]]'s comic fantasy novel ''[[Good Omens]]''. Other projects Gilliam has been trying to get off the ground since the 1990s are an adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (starring [[Mel Gibson]]), an adaptation of ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' by [[Mark Twain]] (which [[List of films based on Arthurian legend#Connecticut Yankee|has been adapted into movies several times before]]), and a script titled ''The Defective Detective'' that Gilliam has co-authored with [[Richard LaGravenese]] (who wrote Gilliam's ''[[The Fisher King]]''). While promoting the US theatrical release of ''The Zero Theorem''. Gilliam revealed he and LaGravenese were meeting to see if ''The Defective Detective'' script could be made into a mini-series. If this comes together, it would be the first time Gilliam has ever helmed for television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Batman-Become-Religion-More-From-Zero-Theorem-Terry-Gilliam-67291-p2.html|title=Batman's Become A Religion And More From The Zero Theorem's Terry Gilliam|publisher=cinemablend.com}}</ref>

It was rumoured that Gilliam may direct&nbsp;– or be involved in the production of&nbsp;– the [[animate]]d band [[Gorillaz]]' movie. In a September 2006 interview with ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', [[Damon Albarn]] was reported saying "...&nbsp;we're making a film. We've got Terry Gilliam involved."<ref name="Uncut">{{cite web|url=http://gorillaz-news.livejournal.com/169939.html#cutid1|title=West London Calling |accessdate=11 October 2006 |author=Williamson, Nigel|year=2006 |issue= 88|work=Uncut}}</ref> However, in a more recent interview with Gorillaz-Unofficial, [[Jamie Hewlett]], the co-creator of the band, stated that since the time of the previous interview, Damon's and his own fixation on the film had lessened. In an August 2008 ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' interview, Gorillaz band members Albarn and Hewlett revealed the nature and title of the project, ''Journey to the West'', a movie adaptation of the [[Monkey: Journey to the West|opera of the same name]] based on a 16th-century Chinese adventure story also known as [[Monkey (novel)|''Monkey'']].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/aug/10/music.classicalandopera ''Monkey magic''], The Observer, 10 August 2008</ref> In January 2008, while on set of ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'', Gilliam stated that he was looking forward to the project, "But I'm still waiting to see a script!"<ref name="Dreams: 2008 News Blog"/>

===Future projects===
After regaining the rights to the screenplay of ''[[The Man Who Killed Don Quixote]]'', Gilliam restarted pre-production in 2008, with Johnny Depp still attached to the project.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Pandora: Don Quixote rides again, says delighted Gilliam|author=Alica-Azania Jarvis |work=The Independent|location=UK|date=4 August 2008|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/pandora/pandora-don-quixote-rides-again-says-delighted-gilliam-884243.html|accessdate=4 August 2008}}</ref> The film will be reshot completely, and Rochefort's role will be recast.

On 16 December 2010, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Gilliam is to "godfather" a film called ''1884'' which is described as an animated [[steampunk]] parody of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', with several former Pythons lending their voice talents to the project whereas Gilliam will be credited as "creative advisor".<ref>Hopewell, John; Keslassy, Elsa (2010).

==Personal life==
Gilliam has been married to British make-up and costume designer Maggie Weston since 1973. She worked on ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'', many of the Python movies, and Gilliam's movies up to ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]''. They have three children, Amy Rainbow Gilliam (born 1978), Holly Dubois Gilliam (born in October 1980), and Harry Thunder Gilliam (born on 3 April 1988), who have also appeared in and/or worked on several of Gilliam's films.

In 1968, Gilliam obtained British citizenship, then held dual American and British citizenship for the next 38 years.
