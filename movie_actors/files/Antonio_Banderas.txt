He showed a strong interest in the performing arts and formed part of the ARA Theatre-School ran by Ángeles Rubio-Argüelles y Alessandri (wife of diplomat, writer and film director [[Edgar Neville]]) and the College of Dramatic Art, both in Málaga. His work in the theater, and his performances on the streets, eventually landed him a spot with the Spanish National Theatre.<ref name="starpulsebio">{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Banderas,_Antonio/Biography/|title=Antonio Banderas Biography|last=Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi|publisher=Star Pulse|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early work, 1982–90===
Banderas began working in small theatres during [[Spain]]'s post-dictatorial cultural movement known as the [[La Movida Madrileña|'Movida']].<ref name="lovestory"/> While performing with the theatre, Banderas caught the attention of Spanish director [[Pedro Almodóvar]], who cast the young actor in his 1982 movie debut ''[[Labyrinth of Passion]]''. Five years later, he went on to appear in the director's ''[[Law of Desire]]'', making headlines with his performance as a [[gay]] man, which required him to engage in his first male-to-male onscreen kiss. After Banderas appeared in Almodóvar's 1986 ''[[Matador (film)|Matador]]'', the director cast him in his internationally acclaimed 1988 film, ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]''. The recognition Banderas gained for his role increased two years later when he starred in Almodóvar's controversial ''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]'' as a [[mental patient]] who kidnaps a porn star ([[Victoria Abril]]) and keeps her tied up until she returns his love.<ref name="starpulsebio"/> It was his breakthrough role in ''Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'', that helped spur him on to [[Hollywood]].<ref name="doctorate"/> Banderas' having become a regular feature of Almodóvar's movies all throughout the 1980s, Almodóvar is credited for helping launch Banderas's international career.<ref name="AP"/>

===Breakthrough, 1991–94===
In 1991, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] introduced Banderas to [[Hollywood]] in ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare]]''. In the movie, Madonna says that she wants to seduce Banderas, even though she knows he is married. The following year, still speaking minimal [[English language|English]], he began acting in U.S. films. Despite having to learn all his lines [[phonetically]], Banderas still managed to turn in a critically praised performance as a struggling musician in his first American drama film, ''[[The Mambo Kings]]'' (1992). {{cn|date=September 2014}}

Banderas then broke through to mainstream American audiences in the film, ''[[Philadelphia (movie)|Philadelphia]]'' (1993), as the lover of AIDS-afflicted lawyer Andrew Beckett ([[Tom Hanks]]). The film's success earned Banderas wide recognition, and the following year he was given a role in [[Neil Jordan]]'s high-profile [[Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles|adaptation]] of [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'', sharing the screen with [[Brad Pitt]].<ref name="starpulsebio"/>

===Worldwide recognition, 1995–present===
He appeared in several major Hollywood releases in [[1995 in film|1995]], including a starring role in the [[Robert Rodriguez]]-directed film ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'' and the antagonist on the action film ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'', co-starred with [[Sylvester Stallone]]. In 1996, he starred alongside [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'', an adaptation of the musical by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] in which he played the narrator, Che, a role played by [[David Essex]] in the original 1978 West End production. He also made success with his role as the legendary masked swordsman [[Zorro]] in the 1998 film ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]''.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

In 2001, he collaborated with [[Robert Rodriguez]] who cast him in the ''[[Spy Kids trilogy|Spy Kids]]'' film trilogy. He also starred in [[Michael Cristofer]]'s ''[[Original Sin (2001 film)|Original Sin]]'' alongside [[Angelina Jolie]] the same year. In 2002, he starred in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Femme Fatale (2002 film)|Femme Fatale]]'' opposite [[Rebecca Romijn|Rebecca Romijn-Stamos]] and in [[Julie Taymor]]'s ''[[Frida]]'' with [[Salma Hayek]]. In 2003, he starred in the last installment of the trilogy ''[[Once Upon A Time In Mexico]]'' (in which he appeared with [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Salma Hayek]]). Banderas' debut as a director was the poorly received ''[[Crazy in Alabama]]'' ([[1999 in film|1999]]), starring his wife [[Melanie Griffith]].<ref>[http://marriage.about.com/od/entertainmen1/p/melaniegriffith.htm Melanie Griffith and Antonio Banderas Marriage Profile - Marriage of Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2003, he returned to the musical genre, appearing to great acclaim in the Broadway revival of [[Maury Yeston]]'s musical ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'', based on the film ''[[8½]]'', playing the prime role originated by [[Raúl Juliá]]. Banderas won both the Outer Critics Circle and Drama Desk awards, and won the [[Tony Award]] for best actor in a musical.<ref name="broadway">{{cite web|title=United Press International|work=Banderas set for Broadway return|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20060404-034720-1455r|accessdate=6 April 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060506115932/http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20060404-034720-1455r|archivedate=6 May 2006|deadurl=no}}</ref> His performance is preserved on the Broadway cast recording released by [[PS Classics]].

[[File:Antonio Banderas 2014.jpg|thumb|Banderas in 2014 at a premiere of ''[[The Expendables 3]]''.]]
Banderas' voice role as "[[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]]" in ''[[Shrek 2]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', and the last film in the Shrek franchise, ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', helped make the character popular on the family film circuit. In 2005, he reprised his role as [[Zorro]] in ''[[The Legend of Zorro]]'', though this was not as successful as ''The Mask of Zorro''. In 2006, he starred in ''[[Take the Lead]]'', a high-set movie in which he played a [[ballroom dancing]] teacher. That year, he directed his second film ''[[Summer Rain (2006 film)|El camino de los ingleses]]'' (English title: ''Summer Rain''), and also received the L.A.

He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 6801 Hollywood Blvd. in 2005.

In 2011, the horror thriller ''[[The Skin I Live In]]'' marked the return of Banderas to [[Pedro Almodóvar]], the Spanish director who launched his international career. The two had not worked together since 1990 (''[[Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!]]''). In ''The Skin I Live In'' he breaks out of the "Latin Lover" mold from his Hollywood work and stars as a calculating revenge-seeking plastic surgeon following the rape of his daughter. According to the [[Associated Press]] Banderas' performance is among his strongest in recent memory.<ref name="AP">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jJinOIb9WP4KNqqGcTaWTFnhYG8w?docId=7f441b478ffa4a558992fe52e158b8f0|title=Spain's Almodovar eyes English-language project|last=Barchfield|first=Jenny|date=21 May 2011|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref> He again lent his voice to [[Puss in Boots]], this time as the protagonist of the ''Shrek'' spin-off family film, ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]''.
