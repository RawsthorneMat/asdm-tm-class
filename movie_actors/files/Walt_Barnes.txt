'''Walter Lee Barnes''' (January 26, 1918&nbsp;– January 6, 1998) was an [[American football]] [[Lineman (American football)#Offensive line|offensive lineman]] in the [[National Football League]] for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  He played [[college football]] at [[Louisiana State University]] as was an actor in both American and European films. He appeared in several films with [[John Wayne]], [[Lex Barker]] and [[Clint Eastwood]].

==Sports career==
Barnes earned his nickname of "Piggy" from catching a piglet when a boy.<ref>http://www.lex-barker.com/index.php?med=scr&lang=eng&menu=barnes</ref> Playing football at [[Parkersburg High School]], he was on the unbeaten 1938 team and played in the 1939 North-South Game.<ref>http://www.dailymail.com/Sports/201006021108</ref> 
Following military service in the [[United States Army]] in World War II as a Army Sergeant<ref>http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=327192</ref> he enrolled in [[Louisiana State University]] <ref>pp.13-14 Didinger, Ray & Lyons, Robert S. ''The Eagles Encyclopedia''  Temple University Press</ref> where he became not only a football player but a college [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]] champion. Following graduation he joined the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] football team as a guard before retiring and becoming a coach of football teams of [[Columbia University]] and [[Arizona State University]].

While playing for the Eagles, Barnes made time to help his alma mater, LSU, by spying on the practices of the [[University of Oklahoma]] football team prior to the 1950 Sugar Bowl.  After being caught by members of the OU football staff and Biloxi, Mississippi residents, Barnes fled to hide in the house of a former LSU teammate, Elbert Manuel.  Both Barnes and Manuel refused OU coach Bud Wilkinson's offer to present themselves for identification to clear their names.  In the end, the spying incident would have little to do with the outcome of the game, as the superior OU team handled LSU very easily 35-0.<ref>http://newsok.com/oklahoma-football-spy-scandal-before-1950-sugar-bowl-angered-the-usually-mild-mannered-bud-wilkinson/article/3918553/?page=1</ref>

He was inducted into the Coaches' Association Hall in June 2010.

==Acting career==
Barnes entered acting through after appearing several times on ''The Eagles Nest'' a local Philadelphia television show.  [[WCAU]] television placed him on several local shows.<ref>http://www.lex-barker.com/index.php?med=scr&lang=eng&menu=barnes</ref>  His contacts with Walt Silver, a producer for [[Warner Bros. Television]] lead him into several appearances on television and films. Some of his more notable appearances included ''[[Bronco (TV series)|Bronco]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Cheyenne]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'' and ''[[Death Valley Days]]''. [[John Wayne]] got him a small role as Charlie the Bartender in ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]''.  

Tiring of small roles and seeing opportunities overseas, Barnes was one of the many American actors who moved to Italy in the early 1960s. [[Kirk Douglas]] recommended him for a role in his ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'' television [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] ''Tales of the Vikings'' that was filmed for Douglas' production company in Germany.  From 1960 to 1969, he was first active in [[Piracy|pirate movies]], then [[Karl May film adaptations]] and [[Spaghetti Western]]s. His popularity in Germany would lead him to receive top billing when his films played there.<ref>p.69 Frayling, Christopher ''Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone''  I. B. Tauris Press</ref>

Barnes returned to the United States in 1969 and appeared in more films and television series, which included ''[[The High Chaparral]]''. His friendship with [[Clint Eastwood]] on ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' later lead him to several roles in Eastwood's films.  He retired from acting in 1987 and became increasingly ill due to his [[diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]].  Barnes died on January 6, 1998.
