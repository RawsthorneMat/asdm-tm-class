'''John Boorman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʊər|m|ə|n}}; born 18 January 1933) is an English filmmaker who is a longtime resident of Ireland and is best known for his feature films such as ''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]'', ''[[Hell in the Pacific]]'', ''[[Deliverance]]'', ''[[Zardoz]]'', ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'', ''[[The Emerald Forest (film)|The Emerald Forest]]'', ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'', ''[[The General (1998 film)|The General]]'', ''[[The Tailor of Panama]]'', and ''[[Queen and Country (film)|Queen and Country]]''. He has directed a total of 22 films and has received five [[Academy Award]] nominations.

==Early life==
Boorman was born in [[Shepperton]], [[Middlesex]], [[England]], the son of Ivy ([[married and maiden names|née]] Chapman) and George Boorman.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/46/John-Boorman.html John Boorman Biography (1933-)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He was educated at the [[Salesian School (Chertsey)|Salesian School]] in [[Chertsey]], [[Surrey]], even though his family was not [[Roman Catholic]].

==Career==
Boorman first began by working as a [[drycleaner]] and [[journalist]] in the late 1950s.  He ran the newsrooms at Southern Television in Southampton and Dover before moving into TV [[documentary film]]making, eventually becoming the head of the [[BBC]]'s Bristol-based Documentary Unit in 1962.

Capturing the interest of producer David Deutsch, he was offered the chance to direct a film aimed at repeating the success of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (directed by [[Richard Lester]] in 1964): ''[[Catch Us If You Can (film)|Catch Us If You Can]]'' (1965) is about competing pop group [[Dave Clark Five]]. While not as successful commercially as Lester's film, it drew good reviews from distinguished critics such as [[Pauline Kael]] and [[Dilys Powell]] and smoothed Boorman's way into the film industry. Boorman was drawn to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] for the opportunity to make larger-scale cinema and in ''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]'' (1967), a powerful interpretation of a [[Donald E. Westlake|Richard Stark]] novel, brought a stranger's vision to the decaying fortress of [[Alcatraz]] and the proto-[[hippy]] world of [[San Francisco]]. [[Lee Marvin]] gave the then-unknown director his full support, telling [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] he deferred all his approvals on the project to Boorman.

After ''Point Blank'', Boorman re-teamed with Lee Marvin and [[Toshiro Mifune]] for the [[robinsonade]] of ''[[Hell in the Pacific]]'' (1968), which tells a fable story of two representative soldiers stranded together on an island.

Returning to the [[United Kingdom]], he made ''[[Leo The Last]]'' (US/UK, 1970). This film exhibited the influence of [[Federico Fellini]] and even starred Fellini regular [[Marcello Mastroianni]], and won him a Best Director award at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]].

Boorman achieved much greater resonance with ''[[Deliverance]]'' (US, 1972, adapted from a novel by [[James Dickey]]), the ordeal of four urban men, played by [[Jon Voight]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Ronny Cox]] and [[Ned Beatty]], who encounter danger from an unexpected quarter while whitewater rafting through the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] backwood. This film became Boorman's first true box office success, earning him several award nominations.

At the beginning of the 1970s, Boorman was planning to film ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and corresponded about his plans with the author, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Ultimately the production proved too costly, though some elements and themes can be seen in ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]''.

A wide variety of films followed. ''[[Zardoz]]'' (1973), starring [[Sean Connery]], was a [[post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction film|science fiction]] piece, set in the 24th century. According to the director's film commentary, the 'Zardoz world' was on a collision course with an "effete" eternal society, which it accomplished, and in the story must reconcile with a more natural human nature.

Boorman was selected as director for ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'' (1977), but the resultant film was widely ridiculed and regarded by many as a failure.

''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' (UK, 1981), a long-held dream project of Boorman's, is a retelling of the [[Arthurian legend]], based on ''[[Le Morte D'Arthur]]''.  Boorman cast actors [[Nicol Williamson]] and [[Helen Mirren]] against their protests, as the two disliked each other intensely, but Boorman felt their mutual antagonism would enhance their characterizations of the characters they were playing. The production was based in the [[Republic of Ireland]], where Boorman had relocated. For the film he employed all of his children as actors and crew and several of Boorman's later films have been 'family business' productions.

''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987, UK) is his most autobiographical movie to date, a retelling of his childhood in London during [[The Blitz]]. Produced by [[Goldcrest Films]], with Hollywood financing the film, it proved a box office hit in the US, receiving numerous [[Academy Award|Oscar]], [[BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe]] nominations. However, his 1990 US-produced comedy about a [[dysfunctional family]], ''[[Where the Heart Is (1990 film)|Where the Heart Is]]'', was a major flop.

''[[The Emerald Forest (film)|The Emerald Forest]]'' (1985) saw Boorman cast his actor son [[Charley Boorman]] as an eco-warrior, in a [[rainforest]] adventure that included commercially required elements – action and near-nudity – with authentic{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[anthropology|anthropological]] detail. [[Rospo Pallenberg]]'s original screenplay was adapted into a book of the same name by award-winning author [[Robert Holdstock]].

When his friend [[David Lean]] died in 1991, Boorman was announced to be taking over direction of Lean's long-planned adaptation of ''[[Nostromo]]'', though the production collapsed. ''[[Beyond Rangoon]]'' (US, 1995) and ''[[The Tailor of Panama]]'' (US/Ireland, 2000) both explore unique worlds with alien characters stranded and desperate.

Boorman won the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director Award]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[The General (1998 film)|The General]]'',<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4909/year/1998.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The General |accessdate=2009-10-02|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> his black-and-white biopic of [[Martin Cahill]]. The film is about a glamorous, yet mysterious, criminal in [[Dublin]] who was killed, apparently by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]]. Boorman himself had been one of Cahill's burglary victims, having the gold record awarded for the score to ''Deliverance'' stolen from his home.

In 2004, Boorman was made a Fellow of [[BAFTA]].

Released in 2006, his ''[[The Tiger's Tail]]'' was a thriller set against the tableau of early 21st century capitalism in Ireland. At the same time, Boorman began work on a long-time pet project of his, a fictional account of the life of Roman Emperor Hadrian (entitled ''[[Memoirs of Hadrian]]''), written in the form of a letter from a dying Hadrian to his successor. In the meantime, a re-make/re-interpretation of the classic ''[[The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz]]'' with Boorman at the helm was announced in August 2009.<ref name="John Boorman - A very English visionary is back">{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/john-boorman--a-very-english-visionary-is-back-1774989.html |title=John Boorman - A very English visionary is back |accessdate=2010-04-28|work=Article in The Independent | location=London | date=21 August 2009}}</ref>

In 2007 and 2009 he took part in a series of events and discussions as part of the [[Arts in Marrakech Festival]] along with his daughter [[Katrine Boorman]] including an event with Kim Cattrall called 'Being Directed'.

In November 2012 he was selected as a President of the main competition jury at the 2012 [[International Film Festival of Marrakech]].

In Autumn 2013 Boorman began shooting ''[[Queen and Country (film)|Queen and Country]]'', the sequel to his 1987 Oscar-nominated ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'', using locations in [[Shepperton]] and [[Romania]]. The film was selected to be screened as part of the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section of the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="Cannes2014">{{cite web |url=http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/cannes/cannes-directors-fortnight-2014-lineup-unveiled/5070844.article |title=Cannes Directors' Fortnight 2014 lineup unveiled |accessdate=26 April 2014 |work=Screendaily}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Boorman lives in [[Annamoe]], [[County Wicklow]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], close to the famous [[Glendalough]] twin lakes.<ref>Flynn, Arthur.

His daughter Katrine (Igrayne in ''Excalibur'') works as an actress in France. John Boorman's daughter Telsche wrote the screenplay for ''[[Where the Heart Is (1990 film)|Where the Heart Is]]''.
