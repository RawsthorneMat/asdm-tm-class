He graduated, in 1953, from [[Principia College]] in [[Elsah, Illinois]].<ref name=people1984 /><ref name=people1977 />

Duvall served in the [[United States Army]] for a short while after the [[Korean War]], from August 19, 1953, to August 20, 1954, leaving as [[Private First Class]]. He explained in 1984: "That's led to some confusion in the press. Some stories have me shooting it out with the Commies from a foxhole over in Frozen Chosen. Pork Chop Hill stuff. Hell, I barely qualified with the M-1 rifle in [[basic training]]".<ref name=people1984 /> While stationed at Camp Gordon (later renamed Fort Gordon) in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Duvall acted in an amateur production of the comedy "[[Room Service (1938 film)|Room Service]]" in nearby [[Augusta, Georgia]].<ref name=people1977 />

In winter 1955, Duvall began studies at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] School of Theater in [[New York]],<ref name=people1984 /> under [[Sanford Meisner]], on the [[G.I. Bill]].

==Career==

===Early career in theatre, television and film: 1952–1969===
Duvall began his professional acting career with the [[Gateway Playhouse]], an [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]] summer theatre based in [[Bellport]], [[Long Island, New York]]. Arguably his stage debut was in its 1952 season when he played the Pilot in ''Laughter In The Stars'', an adaptation of ''[[The Little Prince]]'', at what was then the Gateway Theatre.<ref>Program booklet for {{cite web | url = http://gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1952/1952_Playbill_LaughterInTheStars.pdf' | title = ''Laughter in the Stars'' | date = 1952 | publisher = [[Gateway Playhouse|Gateway Theatre]] | accessdate = December 9, 2012}}</ref>

After a year's absence when he was with the [[U.S. Army]] (1953–54), he returned to Gateway in its 1955 summer season, playing: Eddie Davis in [[Ronald Alexander]]'s ''Time Out For Ginger'' (July 1955), Hal Carter in [[William Inge]]'s ''Picnic'' (July 1955), Charles Wilder in [[John Willard]]'s ''The Cat And The Canary'' (August 1955), Paris in [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''The Crucible'' (August 1955), and John the Witchboy in William Berney and [[Howard Richardson (playwright)|Howard Richardson]]'s ''Dark of the Moon'' (September 1955). The playbill of ''Dark of the Moon'' indicated that he had portrayed the Witchboy before and that he will "repeat his famous portrayal" of this character for the 1955 season's revival of this play. For Gateway's 1956 season (his third season with the Gateway Players), he played the role of Max Halliday in [[Frederick Knott]]'s ''Dial M for Murder'' (July 1956), Virgil Blessing in Inge's ''Bus Stop'' (August 1956), and Clive Mortimer in [[John van Druten]]'s ''I Am a Camera'' (August 1956). The playbills for the 1956 season described him as "an audience favorite" in the last season and as having "appeared at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and studied acting with Sandy Meisner this past winter."

In its 1957 season, he appeared as Mr. Mayher in [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''Witness For The Prosecution'' (July 1957), as Hector in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[Thieves' Carnival]]l'' (July 1957), and the role which he once described as the "catalyst of his career": Eddie Carbone in [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''A View from the Bridge'' (from July 30 to August 3, 1957, and directed by [[Ulu Grosbard]] who was by then a regular director at the Gateway Theatre).<ref>[http://gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1952/1955/1956/1957. Retrieved January 2–3, 2012.]</ref> Miller himself attended one of Duvall's performances as Eddie and also during this performance he met important people that allowed him to, in two months, land a "spectacular lead" in the ''Naked City'' television series.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

While appearing at the Gateway Theatre in the second half of the 1950s, he was also appearing at the Augusta Civic Theatre, the McLean Theatre in [[Virginia]] and the [[Arena Theatre]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The 1957 playbills also described him as "a graduate of the Neighborhood Playhouse" (so he must have completed his studies there by the summer of 1957), "a member of Sanford Meisner's professional Workshop" and as having worked with Alvin Epstein, a [[mime]] and a member of [[Marcel Marceau]]'s Company. By this time also (July 1957) his theatrical credits included performances as Jimmy in ''The Rainmaker'' and as Harvey Weems in [[Horton Foote]]'s ''The Midnight Caller''.<ref name="Playbill_ThievesCarnival 1957">Duvall biography at program booklet for {{cite web |title = ''Thieves' Carnival'' | url = http://gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1957/1957_Playbill_ThievesCarnival.pdf | date = July 23–27, 1957| publisher = [[Gateway Playhouse|Gateway Theatre]] | accessdate = January 3, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Playbill_WitnessFortheProsecution 1957">1957_Playbill_WitnessFortheProsecution.pdf at gatewayplayhouse.com/Archive/Playbill/1957.

At the Neighborhood Playhouse, Meisner cast him in [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''Camino Real'' and the title role of Harvey Weems in Foote's [[one-act play]] ''The Midnight Caller''.

His most notable Off-Broadway performance, for which he won an [[Obie Award]] in 1965 and which he considers his "[[Othello]]", was as Eddie Carbone (again) in Miller's ''[[A View From the Bridge]]'' at the [[Sheridan Square Playhouse]] from January 28, 1965, to December 11, 1966. It was directed again by Ulu Grosbard with [[Dustin Hoffman]].

This played at the [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert Theatre]] and [[George Abbott Theatre]] and closed on December 31, 1966, at the [[Music Box Theatre]].

In 1959, Duvall made his first [[television]] appearance on ''[[Armstrong Circle Theater]]'' in the episode ''The Jailbreak''. He appeared regularly on television as a guest actor during the 1960s, often in action, suspense, detective, or crime dramas. His appearances during this time include performances on ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[T.H.E.

Duvall's screen debut was as Boo Radley in the critically acclaimed ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1962). He was cast in the film on the recommendation of [[screenwriter]] [[Horton Foote]], who met Duvall at Neighborhood Playhouse during a 1957 production of Foote's play, ''[[The Midnight Caller (play)|The Midnight Caller]]''. Foote, who would collaborate with Duvall many more times over the course of their careers, said he believed Duvall had a particular love of common people and ability to infuse fascinating revelations into his roles. Foote has described Duvall as "our number one actor."<ref name="Miracles">{{cite video |people = [[Bruce Beresford]] (actor), Robert Duvall (actor), [[Horton Foote]] (actor), Gary Hertz (director), [[Tess Harper]] (actress) |date = 2002-04-16 |title = Miracles & Mercies |url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/ |medium = Documentary |publisher = [[Blue Underground]] |location = [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], [[California]] |accessdate = 2008-01-28}}</ref>

After ''To Kill a Mockingbird'', Duvall appeared in a number of films during the 1960s, mostly in mid-sized parts but also in a few larger supporting roles. Some of his more notable appearances include the role of Capt. Paul Cabot Winston in ''[[Captain Newman, M.D.]]'' (1963), Chiz in ''[[Countdown (1968 film)|Countdown]]'' (1968), and Gordon in ''[[The Rain People]]''. Duvall has a small part as a cab driver who ferries McQueen around just before the chase scene in the film ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1969). He was the notorious malefactor "Lucky" Ned Pepper in ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969), in which he engaged in a climactic shootout with [[John Wayne]]'s [[Rooster Cogburn (character)|Rooster Cogburn]] on horseback.

===Mid career: 1970–1989===

Duvall became an important presence in American films beginning in the 1970s. He drew a considerable amount of attention in 1970 for his portrayal of the dastardly Major [[Frank Burns]] in the film ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' and for his portrayal of the title role in the [[cult classic]] ''[[THX 1138]]'' in 1971. His first major critical success came portraying [[Tom Hagen]] in ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974). The former film earned him an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. In 1976, Duvall played supporting roles in ''[[The Eagle Has Landed]]'' and as Dr. Watson in ''[[The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (film)|The Seven-Per-Cent Solution]]'' opposite [[Nicol Williamson]], [[Alan Arkin]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and [[Laurence Olivier]].<ref>{{IMDb title|0075194|The Seven-Per-Cent Solution}}</ref>

Duvall received another Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and won both a [[BAFTA Award]] and [[Golden Globe Award]] for his role as Lt. Colonel Kilgore in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979). His line "I love the smell of napalm in the morning" from ''Apocalypse Now'' is regarded as [[cultural icon|iconic]] in [[film|cinema]] history. The full text is as follows:

{{quote|You smell that? Do you smell that? [[Napalm]], son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for twelve hours. When it was all over I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. But the smell! You know - that gasoline smell... the whole hill! Smelled like... victory. (Pause) Some day this war is going to end...}}

Duvall received a BAFTA Award nomination for his portrayal of detestable television executive Frank Hackett in the critically acclaimed film ''[[Network (film)|Network]]'' (1976) and garnered an Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] in ''[[The Great Santini]]'' (1979) as the hard-boiled [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] LtCol. "Bull" Meechum. The latter role was loosely based on a Marine [[Naval aviator|aviator]], Colonel [[Donald Conroy]], the father of the book's author [[Pat Conroy]]. He also co-starred with Laurence Olivier and [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in ''[[The Betsy]]'' (1978) and portrayed United States President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in the [[miniseries|television miniseries]] ''[[Ike (TV miniseries)|Ike]]'' (1979).

In 1977 Duvall returned to Broadway to appear as Walter Cole in [[David Mamet]]'s ''[[American Buffalo (play)|American Buffalo]]''. For his performance he received a [[Drama Desk Award]] nomination for [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play|Outstanding Actor in a Play]].

Duvall continued to appear in films during the 1980s, including the roles of cynical sportswriter Max Mercy in ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984) and Los Angeles police officer Bob Hodges in ''[[Colors (film)|Colors]]'' (1988). He won an Oscar for [[Academy award for best actor|Best Actor]] as [[country music|country western singer]] Mac Sledge in ''[[Tender Mercies]]'' (1983). Duvall was said{{by whom|date=December 2012}} to have written the music, but the actor said he wrote only a few "background, secondary songs." Duvall did do his own singing, insisting it be added to his contract that he sing the songs himself; Duvall said, "What's the point if you're not going to do your own [singing]? They're just going to dub somebody else? I mean, there's no point to that."<ref name="Miracles" />

Actress [[Tess Harper]], who co-starred, said Duvall inhabited the character so fully that she only got to know Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. Director [[Bruce Beresford]], too, said the transformation was so believable to him that he could feel his skin crawling up the back of his neck the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, "Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he's acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny."<ref name="Miracles" /> Nevertheless, Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.<ref name="Miracles" />

In 1989, Duvall appeared in the miniseries ''[[Lonesome Dove (TV miniseries)|Lonesome Dove]]'' in the role of Captain  [[Augustus "Gus" McCrae]], Texas Rangers (retired). He has stated in several forums,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} including ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'',{{date?}} that this particular role was his personal favorite. He won a Golden Globe Award and earned an ''[[Emmy Award]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/robert-duvall|title=Robert Duvall|work=Television Academy}}</ref> nomination. For his role as a former Texas Ranger peace officer, Duvall was trained in the use of Walker revolvers by the Texas [[marksman]] [[Joe Bowman (marksman)|Joe Bowman]].
