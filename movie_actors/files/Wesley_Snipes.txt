==Career==
===Acting===
[[File:snips-cc-2010.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Snipes signing autographs at [[Comic Con International]] in 2010]]
At the age of 23, Snipes was discovered by an agent while performing in a competition. He made his film debut in the 1986 [[Goldie Hawn]] vehicle ''[[Wildcats (film)|Wildcats]]''. Later that year, he appeared on the TV show ''[[Miami Vice]]'' as a drug-dealing [[pimp]] in the episode "Streetwise" (first aired December 5, 1986). In 1987, he appeared as [[Michael Jackson]]'s nemesis in the [[Martin Scorsese]]-directed music video "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" and the feature film ''[[Streets of Gold (film)|Streets of Gold]]''. That same year, Snipes was also considered for the role of [[Geordi La Forge]] in the TV series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', but the role eventually went to [[LeVar Burton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/08/star-trekcasting.html|title=Letters of Note: STAR TREK/Casting|accessdate=March 25, 2010}}</ref>

Snipes' performance in the music video "Bad" caught the eye of director [[Spike Lee]]. Snipes turned down a small role in Lee's ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' for the larger part of Willie Mays Hayes in ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'', beginning a succession of box-office hits for Snipes. Lee would later cast Snipes as the jazz saxophonist Shadow Henderson in ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]'' and as the lead in the interracial romance drama ''[[Jungle Fever]]''. He then Played Thomas Flanagan in [[King of New York]] opposite [[Christopher Walken]]. He played the drug lord Nino Brown in ''[[New Jack City]]'', which was written specifically for him by Barry Michael Cooper. He also played a drug dealer in the 1994 film ''[[Sugar Hill (1994 film)|Sugar Hill]]''.

Snipes has played a number of roles in action films like ''[[Passenger 57]]'', ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'' (with [[Sylvester Stallone]]), ''[[Money Train]]'', ''[[The Fan (1996 film)|The Fan]]'', ''[[U.S. Marshals (film)|U.S. Marshals]]'' and ''[[Rising Sun (film)|Rising Sun]]'', as well as comedies like ''[[White Men Can't Jump]]'', and ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]'' where he played a [[drag queen]]. Snipes has appeared in dramas like ''[[The Waterdance]]'' and ''[[Disappearing Acts]]''.

In 1997, he won the Best Actor [[Volpi Cup]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for his performance in [[New Line Cinema]]'s ''[[One Night Stand (1997 film)|One Night Stand]]''. In 1998, Snipes had his largest commercial success with ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'', which has grossed over $150 million worldwide. The film turned into a [[Blade (film series)|series]]. He also received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and an [[honorary doctorate]] from his alma mater, SUNY/Purchase. In 2005, Snipes sued [[New Line Cinema]], and [[David S. Goyer]], director of ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'', which Snipes also produced. He claimed that the studio did not pay his full salary, that he was intentionally cut out of casting decisions, and that his character's screen time was reduced in favor of co-stars [[Ryan Reynolds]] and [[Jessica Biel]].  The suit was later settled, but no details were released.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alabama Set your local edition &raquo; |url=http://blog.al.com/scenesource/2010/02/wesley_snipes_talks_about_his.html |title=Wesley Snipes talks about his tax trouble and new movie, 'Brooklyn's Finest' &#124; al.com |publisher=Blog.al.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-05}}</ref>

He later appeared in ''The Shooter'' (also known as ''[[The Contractor (2007 film)|The Contractor]]''), filmed in [[Bulgaria]] and the UK, ''[[Gallowwalkers]]'', released in 2012, and ''[[Game of Death (2010 film)|Game Of Death]]''.
[[File:Wesley Snipes 2014 3.jpg|thumb|Snipes in 2014, at the French premiere of ''[[The Expendables 3]]''.]]
Snipes was originally slated to play one of the four leads in Spike Lee's 2008 [[war film]] ''[[Miracle at St. Anna]]'' but had to leave the film due to [[Wesley Snipes#Tax evasion conviction|tax problems]]; his role eventually went to [[Derek Luke]].<ref>Collis, Clark. "Fall Movie Summer Preview, September: Miracle at St. Anna." ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Iss. #1007/1008, August 22/29, 2008, pg. 42–45.</ref>

Snipes made a comeback performance in ''[[Brooklyn's Finest]]'' as Caz, a supporting character. He also had to turn down the part of Hale Caesar in ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' because he was not allowed to leave the United States without the court's approval.<ref>Norman, Tony. [http://postgazette.com/pg/10337/1107809-153.stm "Dear Wesley Snipes: Next Time, Try Wall Street"] ''[[The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' December 3, 2010</ref> In 2014, he appeared in the sequel ''[[The Expendables 3]]''.

=== Other ventures ===
In the late 1990s, Snipes and his brother started a security firm called the Royal Guard of Amen-Ra, dedicated to providing [[VIP]]s with [[bodyguards]] trained in law enforcement and martial arts. Amen-Ra is also the name of his film company. In 1996, the first film produced by Amen-Ra was ''A Great And Mighty Walk – Dr. John Henrik Clarke''.<ref name=autogenerated1>Nashawaty, Chris (December 21, 2007). "The Trials of Wesley Snipes". ''Entertainment Weekly'', pp. 45–51.</ref>

In 2000, the business was investigated for alleged ties to the [[United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors]]. It emerged that Snipes had spotted {{convert|200|acre|km2}} of land near their [[Tama-Re|Tama-Re compound]] in [[Putnam County, Georgia]], intending to buy and use it for his business academy. Both Snipes' business and the groups used Egyptian motifs as their symbols.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Ultimately, Snipes and his brother did not buy the land, instead establishing their company in Florida, [[Antigua]], and Africa.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

In 2005, Snipes was in negotiations to fight ''[[Fear Factor]]'' host [[Joe Rogan]].<ref>[http://www.hiphopmusic.com/inane/archives/2005/11/joe_rogan_vs_we.html Joe Rogan vs. Wesley Snipes in a mixed martial arts bout<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Snipes, who was raised a [[Christian]], converted to [[Islam]] in 1978, but left Islam in 1988. During a 1991 interview, Snipes said "Islam made me more conscious of what African people have accomplished, of my self-worth, and gave me some self-dignity".<ref>"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n11_v46/ai_11256186/?tag=content;col1 Wesley Snipes, Hollywood's hottest new star talks about: his divorce, his days on the streets and why he does not have 'jungle fever'.]" ''[[Ebony Magazine]]''.

Snipes' apartment was destroyed by the collapse of the [[World Trade Center|World Trade Center's Twin Towers]] during the [[September 11 attacks]]. He was on the West Coast at the time.<ref name=TheFan/>

==Income tax conviction==
On October 12, 2006, Snipes, [[Eddie Ray Kahn]], and Douglas P. Rosile were charged with one count of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiring]] to defraud the United States and one count of knowingly making or aiding and abetting the making of a false and fraudulent claim for payment against the United States. Snipes was also charged with six counts of willfully failing to file federal income tax returns by their filing dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/tax/ussnipes101206ind.html|title=Findlaw|publisher=|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}</ref> The conspiracy charge against Snipes alleged that he filed a false amended return, including a false [[tax refund]] claim of over $4 million for the year 1996, and a false amended return, including a false tax refund claim of over US$7.3 million for the year 1997. The government alleged that Snipes attempted to obtain fraudulent tax refunds using a [[Tax protester arguments|tax protester theory]] called the [[Tax protester 861 argument|"861 argument"]] (essentially, an argument that the domestic income of U.S. citizens and residents is not taxable). The government also charged that Snipes sent three worthless, fictitious "bills of exchange" for $14 million to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS).<ref>Superseding Indictment, October 12, 2006, ''United States v. Wesley Trent Snipes'', entry 6, page 8, paragraphs 29 & 30 and page 9, paragraph 39, case no. 5:06-cr-00022-WTH-GRJ, [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida]] (Ocala Div.).</ref>

The government also charged that Snipes failed to file tax returns for the years 1999 through 2004. Snipes responded to his indictment in a letter on December 4, 2006, declaring himself to be "a non-resident alien" of the United States; in reality, Snipes is a [[Birthright citizenship in the United States|birthright U.S. citizen]].<ref>[http://www.ocala.com/article/20080124/BREAKING_NEWS/790471096/1053/BREAKING_NEWS "Feds: Snipes Declared Himself Alien, Warned Against Past Tax Prosecution"], Foxnews.com, January 25, 2008.</ref> Snipes said he was being made an example of and was unfairly targeted by prosecutors because of his fame in connection with the federal tax fraud investigation.

On February 1, 2008, Snipes was acquitted on the felony count of conspiracy to defraud the government and on the felony count of filing a false claim with the government. He was, however, found guilty on three misdemeanor counts of failing to file federal income tax returns (and acquitted on three other "failure to file" charges). His co-defendants, Douglas P. Rosile and Eddie Ray Kahn, were convicted on the conspiracy and false claim charges in connection with the income tax refund claims filed for Snipes.<ref>"Wesley Snipes acquitted of federal tax fraud," MSNBC, February 1, 2008, at [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22955757/].</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/02/01/snipes.court.ap/index.html Snipes acquitted of tax-fraud, conspiracy], Associated Press, as reported by CNN, February 1, 2006.</ref>
