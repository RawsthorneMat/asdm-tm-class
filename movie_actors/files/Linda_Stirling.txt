'''Linda Stirling''' (October 11, 1921 &ndash; July 20, 1997) was an American [[showgirl]], [[Model (person)|model]] and actress.  In her later years, she had a second career as a college English professor for more than two decades. She is most famous for her roles in [[movie serial]]s.

==Career==
Born '''Louise Schultz''' in [[Long Beach, California]], her first role was as a model in ''[[The Powers Girl]]'' in 1943 and her first role in a serial was the title character in ''[[The Tiger Woman (1944 film)|The Tiger Woman]]'' (1944).  In 1946, she married [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] [[screenwriter]] [[Sloan Nibley]]. In 1947, she essentially retired from films to raise a family, although she later appeared in occasional episodes of television shows.

After her career as an actress ended, and her children had grown, Stirling enrolled at UCLA, eventually earning a BFA, an MA, and finally a PhD in English literature at the age of 50. With her degree in hand, Stirling began a new career as a teacher of college English and Drama in the 1960s at [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale College]] in [[Glendale, California]] between 1967 and 1990. In her later life, Stirling sought to distance herself in the classroom from her Hollywood past, but still remained active on the film convention circuit until the last years of her life. She also appeared in a 1990 documentary on Republic Pictures, the studio where she did the bulk of her work.  Her husband, [[Sloan Nibley]], who wrote many of her films, died the same year. Stirling herself died of [[cancer]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California]] in 1997.
