'''William "Bill" Fawcett''' (September 8, 1894 – January 25, 1974)<ref name="William Fawcett - TV.com">[http://www.tv.com/william-fawcett/person/34880/summary.html William Fawcett - TV.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> was a [[character actor]] in [[Hollywood]] B-[[film]]s and in [[television]]. His career extended from 1946 until the early 1970s. He is probably best remembered for his role as the cantankerous, rusty-voiced Pete Wilkey of the Broken Wheel [[Ranch]] on the [[NBC]] [[television series|series]] ''[[Fury (TV series)|Fury]]'', co-starring [[Peter Graves (actor)|Peter Graves]], [[Bobby Diamond]], and [[Roger Mobley]]. He was one of the few actors to have earned a [[Ph.D.]] degree.

==Early years, military and education==
Fawcett was born as William Fawcett Thompson in [[High Forest Township, Minnesota|High Forest]] in [[Olmsted County, Minnesota|Olmsted County]] near [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]] in southeastern [[Minnesota]]. The name "Fawcett" came from the [[physician]] who delivered him. His father, William Eaton Lawrence Thompson, was a [[Methodist]] [[pastor]] who encouraged young Bill to enter the ministry. On September 5, 1916, three days before his twenty-second birthday, Fawcett was licensed to preach by the Hamline Quarterly Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church of Minnesota.<ref name="William Fawcett">[http://brokenwheelranch.com/pete.htm William Fawcett"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
 
During [[World War I]], Fawcett served as an [[ambulance]] driver in the [[United States Army]]. He graduated from Methodist-affiliated [[Hamline University]] in the capital city of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], Minnesota. Fawcett was decorated by the [[France|French]] [[government]] with the [[Légion d'honneur]] for his care of the wounded. After his military service, he went into acting, instead of the ministry, first in [[Canada]] and then in the [[United States]]. He had performed in church [[drama]]s and acted so convincingly that his mother would sometimes cry over his characterizations. He performed in [[repertory theater]] and stock companies during the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name="William Fawcett"/>
  
In 1936, Fawcett procured his Ph.D. in [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan drama]] from the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska]] at [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]].
