'''Ross Martin''' (March 22, 1920 – July 3, 1981) was a [[Polish American]] radio, voice, stage, film and television actor. Martin was known for portraying Artemus Gordon on the [[CBS]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] series ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', which aired from 1965 to 1969. He was the voice of [[Physician|Doctor]] Paul Williams in 1972's ''[[Sealab 2020]]'', additional characters in 1973's ''[[Butch Cassidy (TV series)|Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids]]'', and additional character voices in 1978's ''[[Jana of the Jungle]]''.

==Early life==
Martin was born '''Martin Rosenblatt''' into a [[Polish Jews|Polish-Jewish]] family in [[Horodok, Lviv Oblast|Gródek]], [[Poland]]. His family emigrated to [[New York]] when he was an infant.<ref name="bulletin">{{cite journal|date=1981-07-06|title=Heart attack kill actor Martin|journal=The Bulletin|pages=C–6|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Tv1XAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NPcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2479,4047232&dq=ross+martin+died+corporate&hl=en}}</ref> He spoke  [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Yiddish]] and some [[Russian language|Russian]] before learning [[English language|English]] and later added [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] to his repertoire.

Martin attended [[City College of New York]] where he graduated [[magna cum laude]]. He later earned a law degree from [[George Washington University]].<ref name="bulletin" />

==Career==
Despite academic training in business, instruction, and law, Martin chose a career in acting. He was partners in a comedy team with [[Bernie West]] for several years, then appeared on many radio and live TV broadcasts before making his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in ''[[Hazel Flagg]]'' in 1953. 

Martin's first film was the [[George Pal]] 1955 production ''[[Conquest of Space]]'', followed by a brief but memorable appearance in ''[[The Colossus of New York]]'' (1958), as the scientist father of [[Charles Herbert]]. In 1959, Martin appeared in the episode "Echo" on ''[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond]]''. He appeared in two 1959 episodes of [[David Janssen]]'s [[crime drama]] series, ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]''. Soon after, he caught the eye of [[Blake Edwards]] who cast him in a number of widely varied roles; as Sal in the 1959 ''[[Peter Gunn]]'' episode "The Fuse", his breakout role as the comic sidekick Andamo in the 1959 [[CBS]] drama series ''[[Mr. Lucky (TV series)|Mr. Lucky]]'', the asthmatic kidnapper Red Lynch in the 1962 thriller ''[[Experiment in Terror]]'', culminating with a role in ''[[The Great Race]],'' as the smoothly villainous Baron Rolfe Von Stuppe. According to co-star [[Stephanie Powers]], Martin himself suggested that his billing in ''Experiment in Terror'' be held until the film's end, lest audiences who fondly remembered him as Andamo might not accept him in a villainous role if they knew beforehand it was him.

===''The Wild, Wild West''===

[[File:Ross Martin Wild Wild West 1965.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Martin in 1965]]
After his performance in ''The Great Race'', CBS cast Martin in what was to become his most famous part, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent Artemus Gordon in ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'', opposite [[Robert Conrad]]. The Artemus Gordon character was a master gadgeteer and disguise artist, and these attributes fitted Martin perfectly. Martin himself created most of his disguises for the show, and most of the cast had no idea what he would look like until seeing him during the shooting of the episode. The recent DVD release of the first season of the series includes a recently discovered pre-production sketch Martin had made of his very first make-up design for the pilot episode. Another episode revealed another of Martin's talents:  he was a concert-trained violinist. 

In 1968, Martin broke his leg and then suffered a near-fatal heart attack, forcing ''The Wild Wild West'' to replace him with other actors, including [[Charles Aidman]], [[William Schallert]] and [[Alan Hale, Jr]] for nine episodes.  He was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series]], for the fourth and final season of ''The Wild Wild West''. The series was cancelled in 1969.

===Later career===
After ''The Wild, Wild West'' ended, Martin continued his career in various guest roles on television and in roles in television films. In 1970, Martin portrayed [[Alexander Hamilton]] in the [[NBC]] television special ''Swing Out, Sweet Land'', hosted by [[John Wayne]]. The following year, Martin tried his hand at directing. He guest starred in an episode of "[[Columbo]]" as a murderous art critic and also a 1971 episode of ''[[Love, American Style]]'', which he also directed. Martin directed another episode of the series in 1973. Later that same year, he appeared as the famed Asian detective [[Charlie Chan]] ''The Return of Charlie Chan''. He made a guest appearance on ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'' in 1974, and also lent his voice to an episode of ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'' later that year.

In 1976, Martin returned to the stage as [[John Adams]] in a touring production of the musical ''1776''.<ref>"Ross Martin Booked For Melody Top 1776," ''Milwaukee Sentinel'', March 19, 1976.</ref> In 1978, he did more voice work for the animated series ''[[Jana of the Jungle]]''. He reprised the role of Artemus Gordon in two ''Wild, Wild West'' television movies: ''The Wild Wild West Revisited'' in 1979 and ''More Wild Wild West'' in 1980. He had a five-episode recurring role as kumu mobster Tony Alika on ''[[Hawaii Five-O]]'' from 1978-1979.<ref>imdb.com</ref> In 1980 Martin appeared in the third season of ''The Love Boat'' as Tom Thorton.<ref>{{imdb episode|0636598|April's Love/Happy Ending/We Three}}</ref>  Martin's final role was in the 1983 television movie ''I Married Wyatt Earp''. The film aired two years after his death.

==Personal life==
Martin married his first wife, Muriel Weiss, in 1941. They had one child together, a daughter, Phyllis Rosenblatt (successful New York artist), before Weiss' death from cancer in 1965. In 1967, Martin married Olavee Lucile Parsons (previously a successful model and documentary director) and adopted her two children Rebecca (Martin) Schacht and George Martin.  Martin and Parsons remained married until Martin's death, and she died in 2002.

==Death==
On July 3, 1981, Martin suffered a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after a game of [[tennis]] at a club in [[Ramona, California]].<ref name="bulletin"/> He is interred in [[Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].
