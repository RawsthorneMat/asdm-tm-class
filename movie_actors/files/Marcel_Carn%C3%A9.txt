'''Marcel Carné''' (18 August 1906<ref>[http://marcel-carne.com/biographie/1909.html Article in French explaining the trouble of the date of birth of Marcel Carné]</ref> – 31 October 1996) was a French [[film director]]. A key figure in the [[poetic realism]] movement, Carné's best known films include ''[[Port of Shadows]]'' (1938), ''[[Le Jour Se Lève]]'' (1939), ''[[The Devil's Envoys]]'' (1942) and ''[[Children of Paradise]]'' (1945), the latter of which is often cited as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Paris]], [[France]], the son of a cabinet maker whose wife died when their son was five,<ref>Gary Arnold [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/aug/09/vaults-remembering-marcel-carne//print/ "Vaults: Remembering Marcel Carne",] ''The Washington Times'', 9 August 2009</ref> Carné began his career as a film critic, becoming editor of the weekly publication, ''Hebdo-Films'',<ref>Alan Riding [http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/01/movies/marcel-carne-film-director-dies-at-90.html?pagewanted=1 "Marcel Carne, Film Director, Dies at 90",] ''New York Times'', 1 November 1996</ref> and working for ''Cinémagazine'' and ''Cinémonde'' between 1929 and 1933.<ref name="Roud">Richard Roud "Marcel Carné and Jacques Prevert" in Roud ''Cinema: A Critical Dictionary: Volume One, Aldrich to King'', London: Secker & Warburg, 1980, p.189-92, 189, 191</ref> In the same period he worked in [[silent film]] as a camera assistant with director [[Jacques Feyder]]. By age 25, Carné had already directed his first short film, ''Nogent, Eldorado du dimanche'' (1929). He assisted Feyder (and [[René Clair]]) on several films through to ''[[La kermesse héroïque]]'' (1935).

Feyder accepted an invitation to work in England for [[Alexander Korda]], for whom he made ''[[Knight Without Armour]]'' (1937), but made it possible for Carné to take over his project, ''[[Jenny (1936 film)|Jenny]]'' (1936), as its director.<ref name="Roud"/> The film marked the beginning of a successful collaboration with [[surrealist]] poet and screenwriter [[Jacques Prévert]]. This collaborative relationship lasted for more than a dozen years, during which Carné and Prévert created their best remembered films. Together, they were involved in the [[poetic realism]] film movement of fatalistic tragedies.

Under the [[France during World War II|German occupation]] of France during [[World War II]], Carné worked in the [[Vichy France|Vichy zone]] where he subverted the regime's attempts to control art; several of his team were Jewish, including [[Joseph Kosma]] and set designer [[Alexandre Trauner]]. Under difficult conditions they made Carné's most highly regarded film ''[[Children of Paradise|Les Enfants du paradis]]'' (''Children of Paradise'', 1945) released after the Liberation of France. In the late 1990s, the film was voted "Best French Film of the Century" in a poll of 600 French critics and professionals. Post war, he and Prévert followed this triumph with what at the time was the most expensive production ever undertaken in the history of French film. But the result, titled ''[[Les Portes de la nuit]]'', was panned by the critics and a [[box office]] failure and was their last completed film.

By the 1950s, Carné's reputation was in eclipse. The critics of ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', who became the film makers of the [[French New Wave|New Wave]], dismissed him and placed his film's merits solely with Prévert.<ref name="Adair1">Gilbert Adair and Mike Goodridge [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-marcel-carne-1350140.html Obituary: Marcel Carné,] ''The Independent'', 1 November 1996</ref> Other than his 1958 hit ''[[Les Tricheurs]]'', Carné's postwar films met with only uneven success and many were greeted by an almost unrelenting negative criticism from the press and within members of the film industry. In 1958, Carné was the Head of the Jury at the [[6th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale 1956">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1956/04_jury_1956/04_Jury_1956.html |title=6th Berlin International Film Festival: Juries |accessdate=2009-12-25 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> His 1971 film ''[[Law Breakers]]'' was entered into the [[7th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name="Moscow1971">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1971 |title=7th Moscow International Film Festival (1971) |accessdate=2012-12-23 |work=MIFF}}</ref> Carné made his last film in 1976.

Carné was openly [[homosexual]]. Several of his later films contain references to male homosexuality or [[bisexuality]]. His one-time partner was [[Roland Lesaffre]] who appeared in many of his films.

In 1989 a book was published by Edward Baron Turk as part of the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] Film Studies that told his story under the title ''[[Child of Paradise: Marcel Carné and the Golden Age of French Cinema]]''.

Marcel Carné died in 1996 in [[Clamart]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]], and was buried in the [[Cimetière Saint-Vincent]] in [[Montmartre]].
