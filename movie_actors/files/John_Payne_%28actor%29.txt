==Background==
Payne was born in [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. His mother, Ida Hope (''née'' Schaeffer), a singer, graduated from the Virginia Seminary in Roanoke and married George Washington Payne, a developer in Roanoke. They lived at Fort Lewis, an [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] mansion that became a state historic property but was destroyed by fire in the late 1940s. Payne attended prep school at [[Mercersburg Academy]] in [[Mercersburg, Pennsylvania]] and then went to [[Roanoke College]] in [[Salem, Virginia]]. He then transferred to [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] in the fall of 1930. He studied drama at Columbia and voice at [[Juilliard School]]. To support himself, he took on a variety of odd jobs, including wrestling and singing in [[vaudeville]]. In 1934, a talent scout for the [[The Shubert Organization|Shubert theaters]] spotted Payne and gave him a job as a stock player.

==Career==
[[File:John Payne in uniform 1943.jpg|thumb|200px|John Payne in uniform (1943)]]
Payne toured with several [[Shubert family|Shubert Brothers]] shows, and frequently sang on [[New York]]-based radio programs. In 1936, he landed a contract at [[Samuel Goldwyn]]'s studio and he left New York for Hollywood. His first role in ''[[Dodsworth (film)|Dodsworth]]'' (1936) presented him as an affable, handsome character actor. Following this he was the leading man in the light musical ''[[Lana Lane|Garden of the Moon]]'', which showcased his smooth, harmonious tenor voice. He worked for various studios until 1940, when he signed with 20th Century Fox; Fox made him a star in musicals such as [[Tin Pan Alley (film)|''Tin Pan Alley'']] (1940), ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]'' (1941), ''[[Springtime in the Rockies]]'' (1942) and ''[[Hello, Frisco, Hello]]'' (1943). In these films, he was typically cast as a supporting player in love with the likes of [[Alice Faye]], [[Betty Grable]] and [[Sonja Henie]]. A highlight during this period was co-starring with [[Gene Tierney]] and [[Tyrone Power]] in [[The Razor's Edge (1946 film)|''The Razor's Edge'']] (1946).

''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]'' (1942) as the playboy son of a [[United States Marine Corps]]  World War I veteran, he crosses his Marine Drill Sergeant [[Randolph Scott]] Payne's romantic interest a Navy nurse lieutenant, [[Maureen O'Hara]]. This was one of the top films of 1942.  During [[World War II]] Payne served as a flight instructor in the [[United States Army Air Corps]].

Payne's most popular role may be his final film for Fox, that of attorney Fred Gailey in ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947). It is almost certainly his most visible role, as frequently as that film is aired during the Christmas season.

Later in his career Payne changed his image and began playing tough-guy roles in Hollywood [[film noir|films noir]] and [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] including ''[[Kansas City Confidential]]'' (1952), ''[[99 River Street]]'' (1953), [[Silver Lode (film)|''Silver Lode'']] (1954), ''[[Tennessee's Partner]]'' (1955) and [[Slightly Scarlet (1956 film)|''Slightly Scarlet'']] (1956).  Payne was a contract star with [[Pine-Thomas Productions]] where he shrewdly insisted that the films he appeared in be filmed in color and that the rights to the films revert to him after several years, making him wealthy when he rented them to television.<ref name=BlankE-PT-2006-01-26>{{citation |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_417102.html |title='360 Degrees of Oscar' |author=Blank, Ed |date=January 26, 2006 |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]] |publisher=Trib Total Media, Inc. }}</ref><ref>JOHN PAYNE--the Star Who Likes People: When He Isn't Making a Picture He's Out Meeting the Public and Winning Friends for Hollywood and for Himself
Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune (1923–1963) [Chicago, Ill] 14 Sep 1952: c2.</ref>

In 1955, he paid a $1,000-a-month option for nine months on the [[Ian Fleming]] [[James Bond]] novel [[Moonraker (novel)|''Moonraker'']] (he eventually gave up the option when he learned he could not retain the rights for the entire book series).

Payne also starred as Vint Bonner, an educated, commonsense gunfighter, in ''The Restless Gun,'' which aired on Monday evenings from 1957 to 1959, prior to [[Dale Robertson]]'s western series ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]''. [[Dan Blocker]], [[James Coburn]], and [[Don Grady]] made their first substantive acting forays with Payne on ''The Restless Gun''.

On October 31, 1957, as ''The Restless Gun'' began airing, Payne guest starred on [[The Ford Show|''The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford'']].

In March 1961, Payne suffered extensive, life-threatening injuries when struck by a car in New York City.<ref>{{citation |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20F14FB3F5D1B728DDDAB0894DB405B818AF1D3 |title=John Payne Hit By Car |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 2, 1961 |publisher=The New York Times Company |subscription=yes }}</ref> His recovery took two years. In his later roles, facial scars from the accident can be detected in close-ups; he chose not to have them removed. One of Payne's first public appearances during this period was as a guest panelist on the popular [[CBS]] Sunday night game show ''[[What's My Line?]]''.  In the December 1962 episode, regular panelist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] introduced Payne by saying "He's been in the hospital after a very bad accident.  So it's good to see him fit as a fiddle and all in one piece."  And regular panelist [[Bennett Cerf]] remarked "Good to see you here John.  Glad to see you beat that car on Madison Avenue that bumped into you."

Payne directed one of his last films, ''They Ran for Their Lives'' (1968). His final role was in 1975, when he co-starred with [[Peter Falk]] and [[Janet Leigh]] in the [[Columbo|''Columbo'']] episode "Forgotten Lady".

Payne again teamed up with Alice Faye in a 1974 revival of the musical ''[[Good News (musical)|Good News]]''.

Later in life, Payne, like former [[Daniel Boone (TV series)|''Daniel Boone'']] series star [[Fess Parker]], became wealthy through [[real estate]] investments in [[Southern California]].

==Personal life==
Payne was married to actress [[Anne Shirley (actress)|Anne Shirley]] from 1937 to 1942;<ref>{{citation |title=Anne Shirley Wins Divorce |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=Tribune Company |date=February 20, 1942 |subscription=yes }}</ref> they had a daughter, [[Julie Payne (actress, born 1940)|Julie Anne Payne]].

He was the father-in-law of writer-director [[Robert Towne]], who was married to his oldest daughter Julie until their divorce in 1982.

Payne was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and in October 1960 he was one of many conservative notables who drove in the Nixon-Lodge Bumper Sticker Motorcade in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://framework.latimes.com/2012/05/15/get-your-nixon-bumper-stickers/ | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Framework}}</ref>

==Death==
Payne died in [[Malibu, California]], of [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] on December 6, 1989, aged 77.<ref name=FlintP-NYT-1989-12-08/> His ashes were scattered into the [[Pacific Ocean]].

He has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].
