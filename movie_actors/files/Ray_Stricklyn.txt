'''Ray Stricklyn''' (born '''Lewis Raymond Stricklyn''') (October 8, 1928 – May 14, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[film actor]], [[stage actor]], television actor, [[soap opera]] star and publicist. His acting career took off with [[B-movie]] Westerns that placed his boyish good looks playing opposite top talent of the time.

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Houston, Texas]]; his father was a sign painter. At the age of 16 Ray Stricklyn auditioned for a part in the play ''[[Ah, Wilderness]]'' and was given the lead role. He went on to perform several roles for the Houston Little Theater. 

In 1950 he won a scholarship to a New York drama school. Two years later he made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] début in ''A Climate of Eden'' by [[Moss Hart]].

[[George Seaton]] was in New York casting his film ''The Proud and the Profane'' and gave Stricklyn a one-scene role. He then moved to [[Los Angeles]] to further his film career. After his performance in ''[[Ten North Frederick (film)|Ten North Frederick]]'' (1958), he was given a contract with [[20th Century-Fox]], but it wasn't renewed following ''[[The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker]]'' (1959). His first lead role was as [[Jesse James]] in ''Young Jesse James'' (1960). However, as the 1960s progressed he received fewer film roles and he returned to theatre work. 

Stricklyn made two guest appearances on the [[CBS]] courtroom drama series ''[[Perry Mason]]''. In 1960 he played defendant Gerald Norton in "The Case of the Bashful Burro," and in 1963 he played Reed Brent in "The Case of the Festive Felon." 

In 1965 he was introduced to a furniture refurbisher David Galligan and they became lifetime companions. Galligan later became a noted stage director. 

Stricklyn took work in a fudge factory and then worked as a typist for a mailing company. In 1973 he joined the public relations firm John Springer Associates in Los Angeles and became one of the most influential publicists in Hollywood, working with some of the biggest names in entertainment, including [[Henry Fonda]], [[Shelley Winters]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and [[Bette Davis]]. He also handled the US debut of the [[Rubik's Cube]]. He eventually became the head of the company's West Coast office. 

In 1983 Stricklyn was asked to put together a tribute to [[Tennessee Williams]]. He compiled a one-hour one-man show called ''Confessions of a Nightingale'' in which he himself portrayed Williams. Four weekend performances at the [[Beverly Hills Playhouse]] were planned but it was received so enthusiastically that it ran for over a year. [[Eva Marie Saint]] and her husband Jeffrey Hayden took out a full-page advertisement in ''[[Daily Variety]]'' urging everyone to see the show. He was twice named Best Actor of the Year by the [[Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award|LA Drama Critics Circle]] and [[LA Weekly Theater Award|LA Weekly]]. The show was then taken to Broadway and toured the USA for another year. It was then performed at the Edinburgh Festival.

==Death==
After falling ill with [[emphysema]] in 1997, he began writing his ''[[coming out]]'' autobiography. Published in 1999, ''Angels & Demons: One Actor's Hollywood Journey'', published in Los Angeles by Belle Publishing, 297 pages, ISBN 0-9649635-4-X (hardback), is a candid and witty account of a man who, Stricklyn wrote, "might qualify as one who has had his 15 minutes in the limelight; perhaps even 20."

He is survived by his sister, Mary Ann, and his longtime companion, Los Angeles stage director David Galligan.

==Awards==
* 1958 [[Golden Globe]] - New Star of the Year / Male (nom)
* 1960 [[Golden Globe]] - Best Supporting Actor (nom) - The Plunderers

==Press cuttings==
Ray Stricklyn: Actor whose boyish looks became a hindrance Obituary by Tom Vallance in The Independent, 29th. May, 2002, page 18. "Stricklyn stated that two factors had contributed to his lack of progress. First, his [[homosexuality]] (though he had well-publicised relationships with [[Joan Collins]] and [[Bette Davis]]) and secondly, his persistently youthful appearance."

==Notable Quotes==
* ''I was 27 and still looked 16, but there was a whole new crop of boys coming up who really were that age. I'd thought my career was going straight up. So like a lot of foolish young actors, I started living beyond my means. I bought expensive cars, got into debt. Once you think you're going to be a star, then you're not—it's a rude awakening.''
