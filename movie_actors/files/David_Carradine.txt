Called Jack by his family, Carradine's childhood was turbulent. His parents divorced and repeatedly remarried. He was born to his mother's second marriage of three, and his father's first of four. At the time of their marriage, his mother already had a son by her first husband, whom John adopted. John Carradine planned a large family, but after his wife had a series of [[miscarriage]]s, he discovered she had had numerous illegal abortions without his knowledge. This rendered her unable to carry a baby to full term.<ref name="Endless Highway"/> Against this backdrop of marital discord, Jack almost succeeded in committing suicide<ref name="FOX Bio">[http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2009/06/04/fast-facts-david-carradine-biography/ David Carradine Biography].

He said that the incident followed his discovery that he and his older half-brother Bruce,<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139931/bio</ref> who had been adopted by John, had different biological fathers. He added that, "My father saved me, and then confiscated my comic book collection and burned it&nbsp;– which was scarcely the point".<ref name="Endless Highway"/>

After three years of marriage, Ardenelle Carradine filed for divorce from John, but the couple remained married for another five years.<ref>"Sued for Divorce", ''Desert News'' (February 4, 1945) p. 8</ref> Divorce finally came in 1944, when Jack was seven years old.

Eventually, Jack Carradine returned to California where he graduated from [[Oakland High School (Oakland, California)|Oakland High School]].

Despite an attempt to [[Draft evasion|dodge the draft]],<ref name="Endless Highway"/> in 1960 Carradine was inducted into the [[United States Army]],<ref name="FOX Bio" /> where he drew pictures for training aids.

==Film and television career==

===Early successes===
Upon leaving the Army, Carradine became serious about his acting pursuits. It was at that time that he was advised to change his name to avoid confusion with his famous father. In 1963, he made his television debut on an episode of ''[[Armstrong Circle Theatre]]''. Several other television roles were to follow including appearances on ''Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre'', and ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]].'' He made his feature film debut in 1964 in ''[[Taggart (1964 film)|Taggart]]'', a western based on a novel by [[Louis L'Amour]].

His first "big break", however, came with his second Broadway part in ''[[The Royal Hunt of the Sun]]'', a play by [[Peter Shaffer]] about the destruction of the [[Inca civilization|Inca empire]] by [[conquistador]] [[Francisco Pizarro]]. He said of this performance, "Many of the important roles that I got later on were because the guy who was going to hire me was in that audience and had his mind blown."<ref name="Onion"/> For that part, Carradine won a [[Theatre World Award]] for Best Debut Performance in 1965.<ref name=theatre>{{cite web | title = Theatre World Awards, 1965–66| url = http://www.theatreworldawards.org/award.html| accessdate = June 4, 2009}}</ref>

With the closing of ''The Royal Hunt of the Sun'', and the failing of his marriage, Carradine left New York and headed back to California. He returned to TV to star in the short-lived series ''[[Shane (TV series)|Shane]]'', a 1966 western based upon [[Shane (novel)|a 1949 novel of the same name]] and [[Shane (film)|previously filmed in 1953]].

Carradine guest-starred opposite David McCallum in a 1971 episode of "Night Gallery" entitled "The Phantom Farmhouse."

In 1972, he co-starred as 'Big' Bill Shelly in one of [[Martin Scorsese]]'s earliest films ''[[Boxcar Bertha]]'', which starred [[Barbara Hershey]], his domestic partner at the time (see Personal life). This was one of several [[Roger Corman]] productions in which he was to appear.<ref name="MTV" /> It was also one of a handful of acting collaborations he made with his father, John.

===''Kung Fu''===
[[File:David Carradine as Caine from Kung Fu - c. 1972–1975.jpg|thumb|150px|Carradine as Caine.]]
For three seasons, David Carradine starred as a half-Chinese, half-white [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] monk, [[Kwai Chang Caine]], on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] hit TV series ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' (1972–1975) and was nominated for an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] and a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]]<ref name="HFPA" /> for the role. The show, which took place in the [[Old West]], helped to popularize the martial arts and [[Eastern philosophy]] in the west, and immortalized the character of Kwai Chang Caine, also referred to as "Grasshopper", in popular culture.

Although the choice of a white man to play the role of Kwai Chang Caine stirred controversy, the show served as steady employment for several Asian-American actors in the U.S.<ref>{{cite book

</ref> In addition to [[Keye Luke]] and [[Philip Ahn]], who held leading roles in the cast as Caine's Shaolin masters, [[Robert Ito]], [[James Hong]], [[Benson Fong]], [[Richard Loo]], and [[Victor Sen Yung]] frequently appeared in the series. ''Kung Fu'' ended when Carradine quit to pursue a movie career, but he reprised the role of [[Kwai Chang Caine]] in 1986 in ''[[Kung Fu: The Movie]]''.  [[Brandon Lee]], son of [[Bruce Lee]], in his acting debut, portrayed his son.

In 1991, he reprised the role of Caine in a cameo appearance in the TV movie ''[[The Gambler (TV movie series)|The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw]]'', in which Caine uses his Chinese friends to help the title character in 1903 San Francisco.

Early in the 1990s, Carradine once again reprised the role of Kwai Chang Caine in ''[[Kung Fu: The Legend Continues]]'' (1993–97) playing the grandson of the original character of the same name. Carradine starred in the program and served as executive producer and director. The program offered him the opportunity to recreate the character for which he was most widely recognized.  The show was canceled in 1997, after four seasons and 88 episodes.

===Movie career===
Immediately following the ''Kung Fu'' series, Carradine accepted the role as the race car driver ''Frankenstein'' in ''[[Death Race 2000]]'' (1975), he said, to "kill the image of Caine and launch a movie career".<ref>Carradine, David (1997). ''Spirit of the Shaolin'', Charles Tuttle, p. 49, ISBN 0804817510.</ref> The Roger Corman exploitation film became a cult classic. It was based on [[Ib Melchior]]'s first science fiction work, a short story called ''The Racer''.<ref>Kalat, David (2009). ''Death Race 2000''. TCM Underground, Accessed January 14, 2009</ref>

[[File:Carradine.jpg|Carradine in April 2005|thumb|left]]
In 1976, Carradine earned critical praise for his portrayal of folksinger [[Woody Guthrie]] in [[Hal Ashby]]'s ''[[Bound for Glory (film)|Bound for Glory]]'' (1976) for which he won a [[National Board of Review Award for Best Actor]].<ref>[http://www.nbrmp.org/awards/past.cfm?year=1976 National Board of Review Awards]. Nbrmp.org. Retrieved on July 24, 2013.</ref> He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award<ref name="HFPA" /> and [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for his role as Guthrie. Carradine worked very closely with his friend, singer-songwriter-guitarist, Guthrie Thomas, on the Bound for Glory film assisting Carradine in the guitar style of the period and the songs that had been chosen to be in the film itself.

Next came the role of the alcoholic, unemployed trapeze artist, Abel Rosenberg in ''[[The Serpent's Egg (film)|The Serpent's Egg]]'' (1977). Set in post-World War I Berlin ''The Serpent's Egg'', which also starred [[Liv Ullmann]], is together with ''[[The Touch (1971 film)|The Touch]]'' one of the two only English language films made by legendary [[Sweden|Swedish]] director [[Ingmar Bergman]].<ref>Canby, Vincent [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F01E3DF1E3EE632A25754C2A9679C946990D6CF The Serpent's Egg Screen: Slouching Toward Berlin: Made in Exile](1978) The New York Times</ref> Bergman said of his leading man, "I don't believe in God, but Heaven must have sent him."<ref name="People"/> Carradine said that he and Bergman had plans for further collaboration, but the director's affection for the actor waned when the latter passionately protested a scene which included the butchering of a horse. The altercation caused Carradine to question the fate of Bergman's soul while the director declared, "Little Brother, I am an old whore. I have shot two other horses, burned one and strangled a dog."<ref name="Endless Highway"/><ref name="People"/>

When Bruce Lee died in 1973, he left an unreleased movie script that he had developed with [[James Coburn]] and [[Stirling Silliphant]] called ''The Silent Flute''. The script became ''[[Circle of Iron]]'' (1978) and in the film Carradine played the four roles that were originally intended for Lee. Carradine considered this to be among his best work.<ref>Searle, Robert (July 14, 2009) [http://www.thehdroom.com/news/Circle_of_Iron_Blu-ray_Review/5250 Circle of Iron Blu-ray Review], thehdroom.com</ref><ref>Carradine, David and Moore, Richard "Circle of Iron DVD Extra Feature Commentary"</ref>

In 1980 the thespian appeared in ''[[The Long Riders]]'' (1980), with his half-brothers [[Keith Carradine|Keith]] and [[Robert Carradine]]. The ensemble cast included three other brother/actor groupings: [[Stacy Keach|Stacy]] and [[James Keach]]; [[Dennis Quaid|Dennis]] and [[Randy Quaid]],<ref name="FOX Bio" /> and [[Christopher Guest|Christopher]] and [[Nicholas Guest]]. The movie, which was about the [[Jesse James]] gang, gave Carradine, who played [[Cole Younger]], one of his most memorable roles.<ref name= yinyang>Johnson, Reed (June 5, 2009) [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/05/entertainment/et-carradine5 The Yin-Yang of David Carradine], Los Angeles Times</ref>

[[File:Carradine Signing.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Carradine signing autographs in [[Malmö]] in 2005.]]
Throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s, David Carradine's acting career suffered a decline. Although he continued to amass movie and television credits, few of his roles garnered much attention. Most of his work was released straight to video. However, a few of his movies, such as ''[[The Warrior and the Sorceress]]'' (1984), ''[[Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat]]'' (1990) and ''Sonny Boy'' (1989), developed cult followings. In 1989, he starred in the low budget direct-to-video Swedish action movie ''[[The Mad Bunch]]'' directed by [[Mats Helge Olsson]], making him one of three actors (including [[Heinz Hopf (actor)|Heinz Hopf]] and [[Tor Isedal]]) who have starred in both an Ingmar Bergman movie and an Olsson movie.<ref>Ekeroth, Daniel (2011) ''[[Swedish Sensationsfilms: A Clandestine History of Sex, Thrillers, and Kicker Cinema]]'', Bazillion Points, ISBN 978-0-9796163-6-5.</ref> In 1997, Carradine was awarded a star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]''.

Carradine enjoyed a revival of his fame when he was cast in Quentin Tarantino's sequential ''[[Kill Bill]]''  movies, in 2003 and 2004. Among those who thought his portrayal of Bill, the assassin extraordinaire, would earn him an Academy Award nomination was Scott Mantz, of ''The Mediadrome'', who said, "Carradine practically steals every scene he's in with confident gusto, and he gives a soulful performance that should all but ensure a spot on next year's Oscar ballot."<ref>Mantz, Scott.

===Television appearances===
Carradine attracted notice in 1985 when he appeared in a major supporting role in ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South]]'', a [[miniseries]] about the [[American Civil War]], as the evil and abusive Justin LaMotte. He was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance.<ref name="HFPA" /> He also appeared in ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South, Book II]]'', telecast in May 1986.

In addition, he was featured in a Lipton Tea commercial, which first aired during the broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXVIII]]. The advertisement paid tribute to [[The Three Stooges]] while satirizing his role in ''Kung Fu''.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72222790.html?dids=72222790:72222790&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+31%2C+1994&author=Tom+Shales&pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=Not+Even+the+Commercials+Were+Super&pqatl=google "Not Even the Commercials Were Super"], ''Washington Post'' (January 31, 1994)</ref> In 2001, he appeared in the episode ''The Serpent'' of the syndicated TV series ''[[Queen of Swords (TV series)|Queen of Swords]]'' as the sword-wielding bandit ''El Serpiente'' filmed at [[Texas Hollywood]] studios in Almeria, Spain, home of many [[spaghetti western]]s. David also did a guest appearance in episode 11 of ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'' as himself. David Carradine took over hosting duties from his brother [[Keith Carradine|Keith]] on ''[[Wild West Tech]]'' on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]], in 2005. The same year he also played both himself and the ghost of a dead man for an episode of the NBC TV show ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]''. By 2006, he had become the spokesperson for [[Yellowbook]], a publisher of independent telephone directories in the United States. He also appeared as the ghost of time, ''[[Clockwork]]'', in two episodes of the animated series, ''[[Danny Phantom]]''.  He also starred in the 2008 TV movie, ''[[Kung Fu Killer]]'', in which he played a Chinese martial arts master very similar to his ''Kung Fu'' series "Caine" persona—his character in this movie named "White Crane", and mostly referred to or addressed as "C''r''ane", frequently spoken with a sort of accent that minimized the R sound.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Posthumous releases===
The actor, who once received an award for being the hardest working member of his profession in Hollywood,<ref name="Endless Highway"/><ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/david-carradine-a-slice-of-the-action-568334.html Carradine: A Slice of the Action].

Most of these roles were cameos or small parts in independent, direct to DVD productions. Among them, a horror film, ''[[Dark Fields (2009 film)|Dark Fields]]'' (2009); an action film, ''Bad Cop'' (2009); and a western, ''All Hell Broke Loose'' (2009).

Carradine also appeared in a small role in [[Yuen Woo-ping]]'s Chinese kung fu epic ''[[True Legend]]''. Carradine and Yuen first met while filming ''Kill Bill''. Yuen eulogized Carradine on the ''True Legend'' website, describing him as a "good friend". Yuen said of Carradine, " 'He is among the first Hollywood actors to perform Chinese martial arts on the big screen. In real life he is also a genuine kung fu fan, and knows tai chi, qi gong and Chinese medicine. Same as I, people shall always remember his role as Caine, ''the grasshopper'', in ''Kung Fu'', in the '70s, which was a really unforgettable performance. I feel both great honour and regret that ''True Legend'' is one of David Carradine's last works.'

One of Carradine's last leading roles was in the period drama ''Golden Boys'', set in 1905. It had only a limited theater run, and received little critical attention.<ref>[http://www.justpressplay.net/movie-reviews/929-dvd-reviews/5734-the-golden-boys.html The Golden Boys]. Justpressplay.net (August 18, 2009). Retrieved on 2013-07-24.</ref> It was released on DVD shortly after his death.

His final released movie was the Cult Indy Film, "Night of the Templar", directed by his friend Paul Sampson, in which David wielded a sword (katana) for the final time on screen. Almost like a foreshadowing, there are several peculiar and eerie references in the film that are coincidental to Mr. Carradine's untimely passing which include; cross dressing and auto erotic asphyxiation. His last scene on screen ended in the following dialog: "Well, old friend, see you in the next life time ... "Yeah, Old Friends, Old Soul Mates" ... "Yes, we are.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.imdb.com/news/ni12317180/|title=His Last Film & Dialog|publisher=IMDB|date=2012-07-24|accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>

On the small screen, Carradine appeared in a guest spot on the television series ''[[Mental (TV series)|Mental]]'' that was broadcast just days after his death. On October 3, 2009, ''[[Celebrity Ghost Stories]]'' premiered on the [[Biography Channel]] with an interview of David Carradine discussing his belief that his closet was haunted by his wife's deceased previous husband.  The segment, which was described as "eerie", was filmed four months before his own death.<ref>Starr, Michael (September 22, 2009) "[http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/item_9RRHKaf3vqK4XClnWkjnzK A Closet Case]", ''New York Post''.</ref> In his last of many collaborations with producer Roger Corman, Carradine appeared in the ''Syfy Channel'''s science fiction monster movie ''Dinocroc Vs.

==Directing career==
Carradine made his directorial debut on three episodes of ''Kung Fu''.  While still performing on ''Kung Fu'', he tried his hand at directing some independent films of his own. [[Americana (1983 film)|''Americana'']] (1983), took ten years to complete due to difficulty in financing. It featured Carradine in the starring role and several of his friends and family members in supporting roles. The film won the People's Choice Award at the [[Director's Fortnight]] at [[Cannes]], but failed to achieve critical support or adequate distribution.<ref name="Endless Highway"/><ref>Honeycutt, Kurt (June 5, 2009) [http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5541C320090605 Carradine's "Americana" was one from the heart], ''Reuters''</ref> Other directorial attempts included ''You and Me'' (1975),<ref name="FOX Bio" /> and two unreleased productions: ''Mata Hari'', an epic that starred his daughter, Calista; and a short musical called ''A Country Mile''.<ref name="Endless Highway" />

==Martial artist==
Carradine knew nothing of the practice of [[kung fu]] at the time he was cast in the role of Kwai Chang Caine, instead he relied on his experience as a dancer for the part.<ref name="MTV"/> He also had experience in sword fighting, [[boxing]], and [[street fighting]] on which to draw.<ref name=Axemaker/> For the first half of the original series, David Chow provided technical assistance with kung fu. Later, Kam Yuen provided the expertise. It was not until after the series was canceled that Carradine began to study martial arts,<ref name= yinyang /> first from Yuen and eventually from Rob Moses, a student of Yuen's. He never considered himself a master of the art, but rather an "[[Evangelism|evangelist]]" of kung fu.<ref name="Arnold"/><ref name="Spirit"/> By 2003 he had acquired enough expertise in martial arts to produce and star in several instructional videos on [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] and [[Qigong]]. In 2005, Carradine visited the [[Shaolin Monastery]] in [[Henan, China]] as part of the extra features for the third season of the ''Kung Fu'' DVDs. During his visit, the abbot, [[Shi Yongxin|Shi Yǒngxìn]], said that he recognized Carradine's important contribution to the promotion of the Shaolin Monastery and kung fu culture, to which Carradine replied, "I am happy to serve."<ref>{{YouTube|aEWjJ9nrUm8|"David Carradine's Shaolin Diaries: Back to the Beginning"}}, Season 3 DVD.

==Music career==
[[File:DavidCarradineSept06.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Carradine in 2006]]
In addition to his acting career, David Carradine was a musician. He sang and played the piano, the guitar and the flute among other instruments.<ref name=beatcrave>Hyatt, Jeff (June 4, 2009) [http://beatcrave.com/2009-06-04/david-carradine/David Carradine Leaves Behind a Musical Legacy], ''Beat Crave''</ref> In 1970, Carradine played one half of a flower power beatnik duo in the season 4 ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'' episode 'The Quincunx', performing the songs 'I Stepped on a Flower', 'Lonesome Stranger' and 'Sorrow of the Singing Tree'.

He performed several of [[Woody Guthrie]]'s songs for the movie ''[[Bound for Glory (film)|Bound for Glory]]''. For the [[Kung Fu (TV series)|''Kung Fu'']] series he made flutes out of bamboo that he had planted on the Warner Brothers lot which he played on the program.

==Personal life==
[[File:David Carradine with family in 1987.jpg|320px|thumb|Carradine with wife Gail and daughter Kansas in 1987]]
Shortly after being drafted into the Army in 1960, Carradine proposed marriage to Donna Lee Becht (born September 26, 1937),<ref name=who>{{cite book | title = [[Marquis Who's Who|Who's Who in America]] – 2009 | year = 2008 | edition = 63 | accessdate = June 4, 2009}}</ref><ref name="IMDBbio">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001016/bio David Carradine Biography] at [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> whom he had met while they were students at Oakland High School. They were married on Christmas Day that year.  She lived with him off-base in Virginia while he was stationed at Fort Eustis. In April 1962, she gave birth to their daughter Calista. After his discharge, they lived in New York while Carradine established his acting career, appearing on Broadway in ''The Deputy''<ref name=beatcrave /> and ''Royal Hunt of the Sun''. The marriage dissolved in 1968, whereupon Carradine left New York and headed back to California to continue his television and film careers.

In 1969, Carradine met actress [[Barbara Hershey]] while the two of them were working on ''[[Heaven with a Gun]]''.<ref name="Endless Highway"/> The pair lived together until 1975.<ref name="NYTObit">{{cite news| title = David Carradine, Actor, Is Dead at 72| first = Bruce| last = Weber| date = June 4, 2009| accessdate = June 6, 2009| work = [[The New York Times]]

The relationship fell apart around the time of his 1974 burglary arrest,<ref>Lewis, Barbara (November 20, 1975) "David Carrdine Feels Typecast As Guthrie", ''Lakeland Ledger''</ref> when Carradine began an affair with [[Season Hubley]], who had guest-starred on ''Kung Fu''.

In February 1977, Carradine married his second wife, Linda, (née Linda Anne Gilbert, born March 16, 1950) the former wife of [[The Byrds]] lead guitarist, [[Roger McGuinn]],<ref name="People"/> in a civil ceremony, in Munich, Germany, immediately following the filming of ''The Serpent's Egg''.<ref>"David Carradine Marries in Munich", ''St. Petersburg Times'' (February 5, 1977) p. 9</ref> Their daughter Kansas was born April 19, 1978.

Vicki Roberts, his attorney and longtime friend of his wife, performed the ceremony.

===Controversies after death===
On the first anniversary of his death, Carradine's widow, Annie, announced that she had filed a lawsuit for wrongful death against the company that produced the film that Carradine was working on at the time of his death. The lawsuit claimed that the company failed to provide assistance to the actor that had been agreed upon in his contract. "The suit alleges, the assistant left him behind for dinner on the night before the actor was found dead. The assistant and other film staffers apparently could not reach Carradine, and decided to leave without him. Carradine called the assistant an hour later but was told the group was across town and he would have to make his own arrangements that evening."<ref>{{Wayback |date=20120401165237 |url=http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-carradine-lawsuit,0,3371390.story |title="David Carradine's Widow Files Wrongful Death Suit"}}.
