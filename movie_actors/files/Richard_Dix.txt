'''Richard Dix''' (July 18, 1893 – September 20, 1949) was an American [[motion picture]] [[actor]] who achieved popularity in both [[silent film|silent]] and sound film.<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', September 21, 1949.</ref> His standard on-screen image was that of the rugged and stalwart hero. He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his lead role in the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]-winning epic, ''[[Cimarron (1931 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1931).

==Early life==
Dix was born '''Ernst Carlton Brimmer''' on July 18, 1893, in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]]. There he was educated, and at the desire of his father, studied to be a surgeon. His obvious acting talent in his school dramatic club led him to leading roles in most of the school plays. At 6' and 180 pounds, Dix excelled in sports, especially football and baseball. These skills would serve him well in the vigorous film roles he would go on to play. After a year at the [[University of Minnesota]], he took a position at a bank, spending his evenings training for the stage. His professional start was with a local stock company, and this led to similar work in [[New York City]]. The death of his father left him with a mother and sister to support. He went to Los Angeles and became leading man for the Morosco Stock Company. His success there got him a contract with Paramount Pictures.

==Career==

He then changed his name to Dix. After his move to [[Hollywood]], he began a career in [[Western movie]]s. One of the few actors to successfully bridge the transition from silent films to talkies, Dix's best-remembered early role was in [[Cecil B. Demille]]'s silent version of ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923). He was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in 1931 for his performance as Yancey Cravat in ''[[Cimarron (1931 film)|Cimarron]]'', in which he was [[Billing (filmmaking)|top-billed]] over [[Irene Dunne]]. ''Cimarron'', based on the popular novel by [[Edna Ferber]], took the Best Picture award. Dix starred in another RKO adventure, ''[[The Lost Squadron]].''

A memorable role for Dix was in the 1935 British futuristic film ''[[The Tunnel (1935 film)|The Tunnel]]''. Dix starred in ''The Great Jasper'' and ''Blind Alibi'' in the late 1930s. His popular [[RKO Radio Pictures]] co-star in ''Blind Alibi'' was [[Ace the Wonder Dog]]. Dix's human co-stars were Whitney Bourne and [[Eduardo Ciannelli]]; the film was directed by [[Lew Landers]]. Dix also starred as the homicidal Captain Stone in the [[Val Lewton]] production of ''[[The Ghost Ship]]'', directed by [[Mark Robson]].

In 1941, Dix played [[Wild Bill Hickok]] in ''Badlands of Dakota'' and portrayed [[Wyatt Earp]] the following year in ''[[Tombstone, the Town Too Tough to Die]]'', featuring [[Edgar Buchanan]] as [[Curly Bill Brocious]].

In 1944, he starred in ''[[The Whistler (1944 film)|The Whistler]]'', the first in a series of eight [[The Whistler#Films|"Whistler" films]] made by [[Columbia Pictures]]. He also starred in the next six movies in the series, playing a different character each time. (He did not play the "Whistler", who was an unseen narrator.) Dix retired from acting after the seventh of these films, ''The Thirteenth Hour'', and died two years later in the wake of a heart attack at age 56.

==Hobbies==
According to the July 1934 ''Movies'' magazine, on his ranch near Hollywood, whose location he kept a close secret, Dix raised thousands of chickens and turkeys each year. He also had a collection of thousands of pipes, and a "collection" of 36 dogs, "Scotties and English setters". He also read at least five books a week.

==Death==
Richard Dix first married Winifred Coe on October 20, 1931. They had a daughter, Martha Mary Ellen, and divorced in 1933. He then married Virginia Webster on June 29, 1934. They had twin boys, Richard Jr. and Robert Dix, and an adopted daughter, Sara Sue.

He retired from films in 1947.

After suffering a serious [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on September 12, 1949 while on a train from New York to Los Angeles<ref>''The Advertiser (Adelaide)'', "Richard Dix Ill", 14 September 1949, p. 1</ref> Dix died at the age of 56 on September 20, 1949. He was survived by four children from his two marriages. Richard Dix, Sr. was interred in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]].

Richard Dix has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1610 Vine Street.
