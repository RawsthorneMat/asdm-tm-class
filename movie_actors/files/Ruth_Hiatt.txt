She made two two-reel comedies ''[[The Inner Chamber]]'' (1915) and ''[[The Vigilantes]]'' (1918). Afterward she reuturned to high school which she

As teenager she was ''discovered'' by comedian [[Lloyd Hamilton]]. She became his [[leading lady]] at [[United Artists]] studios in 1922. Hiatt was a former ''classic'' dancer who was Hamilton's successor to [[Irene Dalton]]. Their first work together is the short comedy ''[[The Speeder]]'' (1922). It is a production of the Hamilton Comedy Film Company.

Hiatt played a street urchin in support of Hamilton in ''Lonesome'' (1924). In the role she wears high top shoes which were once worn by [[United States Senator]] [[Harry Lane]] of [[Oregon]]. Lane discarded them at the home of his cousin, cartoonist [[Pinto Colvig]].

In ''[[Smith's Bab]]y'' (1925) Hiatt is the female lead with [[Raymond McKee]]. Sennett cast Hiatt and McKee with ''[[Our Gang]]'' child star [[Mary Ann Jackson]] in 1927. The short comedies continued the ''Jimmy Smith'' series with titles like ''[[Smith's Pony]]'' (1927), ''[[Smith's Cook]]'' (1927), ''[[Smith's Cousin]]'' (1927), and ''[[Smith's Modiste Shop]]'' (1927). The movies were produced by [[Pathe Pictures]]. Jackson and McKee teamed with Hiatt and [[Hoot Gibson]] in ''[[The Flying Cowboy]]'' (1928).

Hiatt appeared in the second chapter of the [[Ken Maynard]] ''[[Sunset Trail]]'' (1932) serial entitled ''Battling With [[Buffalo Bill]]''. Maynard's horse, ''Tarzan'', was in this story of the open range before the army and law enforcement established themselves in western cattle towns.

Hiatt's film career endured through 1941. Some of her later appearances were in [[the Three Stooges]] comedy ''[[Men in Black (1934 film)|Men In Black]]'', the ''[[Our Gang]]'' entry ''[[Beginner's Luck]]'', ''[[Just Speeding]]'' (1936) and ''[[Double Trouble (1941 film)|Double Trouble]]'' (1941).

Hiatt was blonde but one reporter covering the WAMPAS banquet in [[San Francisco]], in December 1923, wrote that she was brunette.
