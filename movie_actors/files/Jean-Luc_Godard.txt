'''Jean-Luc Godard''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃lyk ɡɔdaʁ|lang}}; born 3 December 1930) is a French-Swiss film director, screenwriter and [[film criticism|film critic]]. He is often identified with the 1960s French film movement ''La Nouvelle Vague'', or "[[French New Wave|New Wave]]".{{sfn|Grant|2007|loc=Vol. 4, p. 235}}

Like his New Wave contemporaries, Godard criticized mainstream French cinema's "Tradition of Quality",{{sfn|Grant|2007|loc=Vol. 4, p. 235}} which "emphasized craft over innovation, privileged established directors over new directors, and preferred the great works of the past to experimentation."{{sfn|Grant|2007|loc=Vol. 2, p. 259}} To challenge this tradition, he and like-minded critics started to make their own films.{{sfn|Grant|2007|loc=Vol. 4, p. 235}} Many of Godard's films challenge the conventions of traditional [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] in addition to French cinema.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean-Luc Godard|url=http://www.newwavefilm.com/french-new-wave-encyclopedia/jean-luc-godard.shtml|work=New Wave Film|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> He is often considered the most radical French filmmaker of the 1960s and 1970s;{{sfn|Grant|2007|loc=Vol. 4, p. 126}} his approach in film conventions, politics and philosophies made him arguably the most influential director of the French New Wave. Along with showing knowledge of [[History of Film|film history]] through homages and references, several of his films expressed his political views; he was an avid reader of [[existentialism|existential]] and [[Marxist philosophy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|loc=Vol. 4, p. 126}}<ref>{{cite web|title=40 Years Ago, 'Breathless' Was Hyperactive Anarchy. Now It's Part of the Canon|url=http://www.davidsterritt.com/breathless.html|author=David Sterritt|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>

Since the New Wave, his politics have been much less radical and his recent films are about [[Representation (arts)|representation]] and human conflict from a [[Humanism|humanist]], and a Marxist perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|loc=Vol. 4, p. 126}}

In a 2002 ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' poll, Godard ranked third in the critics' top-ten directors of all time (which was put together by assembling the directors of the individual films for which the critics voted).<ref>{{cite web| title = BFI – Sight & Sound – Top Ten Poll 2002 Poll – The Critics' Top Ten Directors| url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/critics-directors.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110623182355/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/critics-directors.html |archivedate=23 June 2011}}</ref> He is said to have "created one of the largest bodies of critical analysis of any filmmaker since the mid-twentieth century."{{sfn|Grant|2007|loc=Vol. 4, p. 238}} He and his work have been central to [[narratology|narrative theory]] and have "challenged both commercial narrative cinema norms and film criticism's vocabulary."{{sfn|Grant|2007|loc=Vol. 4, p. 202}} In 2010, Godard was awarded an [[Academy Honorary Award]], but did not attend the award ceremony.<ref>{{cite web|last=Freeman |first=Nate |url=http://www.observer.com/2010/politics/godard-companion-says-director-will-skip-oscars-calls-honorary-statue-bit-metal |title=Godard Companion: Director Will Not Travel to Oscars for a ‘Bit of Metal’ &#124; The New York Observer |publisher=Observer.com |date= |accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref>

== Early life ==

Jean-Luc Godard was born on 3 December 1930<ref name=moullet>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Moullet|first=Luc|editor=Jim Hillier|title=Jean-Luc Godard |encyclopedia=Cahiers du cinéma: 1960–1968.

She was the great-granddaughter of theologian [[Adolphe Monod]]. Relatives on his mother's side include also composer [[Jacques-Louis Monod]], naturalist [[Théodore Monod]] and pastor [[Frédéric Monod]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pg/Jean_Luc_Godard.html |title=The religion of director Jean-Luc Godard |publisher=Adherents.com |accessdate=29 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ordiecole.com/cinema/godard_monod.html |title=Jean Monod (1765–1836), pasteur |publisher=Ordiecole.com |accessdate=29 December 2011}}</ref> Four years after Jean-Luc's birth, his father moved the family to Switzerland. At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Godard was in France and returned to Switzerland with difficulty. He spent most of the war in Switzerland, although his family made clandestine trips to his grandfather's estate on the French side of [[Lake Geneva]]. Godard attended school in [[Nyon]], Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean-Luc Godard|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/jean-luc-godard-p91804|website=AllMovie|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>

Not a frequent cinema-goer, he attributed his introduction to cinema to a reading of Malraux's essay ''Outline of a Psychology of Cinema'', and his reading of ''La Revue du cinéma'', which was relaunched in 1946.<ref>Richard Brody, Everything is Cinema, p6</ref>  In 1946, he went to study at the Lycée Buffon in Paris and, through family connections, mixed with members of its cultural elite. He lodged with the writer [[Jean Schlumberger]]. Having failed his baccalaureate exam in 1948 he returned to Switzerland. He studied in [[Lausanne]] and lived with his parents, whose marriage was breaking up. He spent time in Geneva also with a group that included another film fanatic, Roland Tolmatchoff, and the extreme rightist philosopher [[Jean Parvulesco]]. His older sister Rachel encouraged him to paint, which he did, in an abstract style. After time spent at a boarding school in [[Thonon]] to prepare for the retest, which he passed, he returned to Paris in 1949.<ref>Richard Brody, p. 7</ref> He registered for a certificate in [[anthropology]] at the [[University of Paris]] (Sorbonne), but did not attend class.{{sfn|MacCabe|2005|loc=[http://books.google.com/books?id=FwLqbp0cEp8C&pg=PA37 p. 36]}} He got involved with the young group of film critics at the [[Film society#France|ciné-club]]s that started the New Wave. Godard originally held only French citizenship, then in 1953, he became a citizen of [[Gland, Switzerland|Gland]], [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Vaud]], Switzerland, possibly through simplified naturalisation through his Swiss father.

== Early career (1950–59) ==

=== Film criticism ===
In Paris, in the [[Quartier Latin|Latin Quarter]] just prior to 1950, ''ciné-clubs'' (film societies) were gaining prominence. Godard began attending these clubs—the Cinémathèque, the CCQL, Work and Culture ciné Club, and others, became his regular haunts. The Cinémathèque had been founded by [[Henri Langlois]] and [[Georges Franju]] in 1936; Work and Culture was a workers' education group for which [[André Bazin]] had organized wartime film screenings and discussions and which had become a model for the film clubs that had risen throughout France after the Liberation; Ciné-Club du Quartier Latin (CCQL), founded 1947-48, was animated and intellectually led by [[Maurice Schérer]].<ref>Richard Brody, pp. 8–17</ref> At these clubs he met fellow film enthusiasts including [[Jacques Rivette]], [[Claude Chabrol]], and [[François Truffaut]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean-Luc Godard Biography: The Black Sheep|url=http://www.newwavefilm.com/french-new-wave-encyclopedia/jean-luc-godard.shtml#blacksheep|work=New Wave Film|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> Godard was part of a generation for whom cinema took on a special importance. He has said: "In the 1950s cinema was as important as bread—but it isn't the case any more. We thought cinema would assert itself as an instrument of knowledge, a microscope... a telescope.... At the [[Cinémathèque Française|Cinémathèque]] I discovered a world which nobody had spoken to me about. They'd told us about Goethe, but not [[Carl Theodor Dreyer|Dreyer]]. ... We watched silent films in the era of talkies. We dreamed about film. We were like Christians in the catacombs."<ref>{{cite web|title=Godard Biography|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/Jean-Luc-Godard/biography/|work=Monsters and Critics|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref><ref>'Le cinema n'a pas su remplir son role' Jean-Pierre Lavoignat and Christophe d'Yvoire, ''Studio'' , number 96, 155-158 [http://www.oocities.org/paris/4206/refr000.htm#03]</ref>

His foray into films began in the field of [[Film criticism|criticism]]. Along with Maurice Schérer (writing under the to-be-famous pseudonym Éric Rohmer) and Rivette, he founded the short-lived film journal ''Gazette du cinéma'', which saw publication of five issues in 1950.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean-Luc Godard Biography: What is Cinema?|url=http://www.newwavefilm.com/french-new-wave-encyclopedia/jean-luc-godard.shtml#whatiscinema|work=New Wave Film|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> When Bazin co-founded the influential critical magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' in 1951, Godard was the first of the younger critics from the CCQL/Cinémathèque group to be published—the January 1952 issue featured his review of an American melodrama directed by [[Rudolph Maté]], ''[[No Sad Songs for Me]]''. His "Defence and Illustration of Classical Découpage" published in September 1952, in which he attacks an earlier article by Bazin and defends the use of the shot-reverse shot technique, is one of his earliest important contributions to cinema.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean-Luc Godard Biography: Cahiers du Cinema|url=http://www.newwavefilm.com/french-new-wave-encyclopedia/jean-luc-godard.shtml#cahiers|work=New Wave Film|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> Praising [[Otto Preminger]] and, "the greatest American artist—[[Howard Hawks]]", Godard raises their harsh melodramas above the more "formalistic and overtly artful films of [[Orson Welles|Welles]], [[Vittorio De Sica|De Sica]] and [[William Wyler|Wyler]] which Bazin endorsed""<ref>Brody, pp. 29–30.</ref> At this point Godard's activities did not include making films—rather he watched films, and wrote about them, and helped others make films, notably Rohmer, with whom he worked on ''[[w:fr:Présentation ou Charlotte et son steak]]''.<ref>Brody, pp. 26–27.</ref>

=== Filmmaking ===
Having left Paris in the autumn of 1952, Godard returned to Switzerland and went to live with his mother in Lausanne. He became friendly with his mother's lover, Jean-Pierre Laubscher, who was a labourer on the [[Grande Dixence Dam]]. Through Laubscher he secured work himself as a construction worker at the Plaz Fleuri work site at the dam. He saw the possibility of making a documentary film about the dam and when his initial contract ended, in order to prolong his time at the dam, moved to the post of telephone switchboard operator. It was whilst on duty, in April 1954, that he put through a call to Laubscher that relayed the fact that Odile Monod, his mother, had died in a scooter accident. Thanks to Swiss friends who lent him a 35mm movie camera, he was able to shoot on 35mm film. He rewrote the commentary that Laubscher had written, and gave his film a rhyming title ''[[Opération béton]]'' (Operation concrete). The company that administered the dam bought the film and used it for publicity purposes.<ref>Richard Brody, pp. 31–34.</ref>

As he continued to work for ''Cahiers'', he made ''[[Une femme coquette]]'' (1955), in [[Geneva]], a ten-minute short; and in January 1956 he returned to Paris. A plan for a feature film of [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Elective Affinities]]'' proved too ambitious and came to nothing. Truffaut enlisted his help to work on an idea he had for a film based on the true-crime story of a petty criminal, Michel Portail, who had shot a motorcycle policeman and whose girlfriend had turned him in to the police. But Truffaut failed to interest any producers. Another project with Truffaut, a comedy about a country girl arriving in Paris, was also abandoned.<ref>Brody, pp. 39–42.</ref> He worked with Rohmer on a planned series of short films centering around the lives of two young women, Charlotte and Véronique; and in the autumn of 1957, [[Pierre Braunberger]] produced the first film in the series, ''[[Tous les garçons s'appellent Patrick|All the Boys Are Named Patrick]]'', directed by Godard from Rohmer's script.  ''[[Une histoire d'eau]]'' (1958) was created largely out of unused footage shot by Truffaut. In 1958, Godard, with a cast that included [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] and Anne Colette, made his last short before gaining international prominence as a filmmaker, ''[[Charlotte et son Jules]]'', an homage to [[Jean Cocteau]]. The film was shot in Godard's hotel room on the rue de Rennes and apparently reflected something of the 'romantic austerity' of Godard's own life at this time. His Swiss friend Roland Tolmatchoff noted; "In Paris he had a big [[Humphrey Bogart|Bogart]] poster on the wall and nothing else." <ref>Brody, p. 45.</ref> In December 1958, Godard reported from the Festival of Short Films in [[Tours]] and praised the work of, and became friends with, [[Jacques Demy]], [[Jacques Rozier]], and [[Agnès Varda]]—he already knew [[Alain Resnais]] whose entry he also praised—but Godard now wanted to make a feature film. He travelled to the [[1959 Cannes Film Festival]] and asked Truffaut to let him use the story on which they had collaborated in 1956, about the car thief Michel Portail. He sought money from the producer [[Georges de Beauregard]] whom he had met previously whilst working briefly in the publicity department of Twentieth Century Fox's Paris office, and who was also at the Festival. Beauregard could offer his expertise, but was in debt from two productions based on [[Pierre Loti]] stories and so finance came rather from a film distributor, René Pignières.<ref>Brody, pp. 47, 50.</ref>

== Cinematic period (1960–68) ==
Godard's most celebrated period as a director spans roughly from his first feature, ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' (1960), through to ''[[Week End (1967 film)|Week End]]'' (1967). His work during this period focused on relatively conventional films that often refer to different aspects of film history. Although Godard's work during this time is considered groundbreaking in its own right, the period stands in contrast to that which immediately followed it, during which Godard ideologically denounced much of cinema's history as "bourgeois" and therefore without merit.

=== Films ===
Godard's ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' (''À bout de souffle'', 1960), starring [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] and [[Jean Seberg]] distinctly expressed the [[French New Wave]]'s style, and incorporated quotations from several elements of popular culture—specifically [[American cinema|American]] [[film noir]].<ref>Brody, p. 59.</ref> The film employed various innovative techniques such as [[jump cuts]]—traditionally considered amateurish <ref>Brody, p. 69.</ref>—[[aside|character asides]] and breaking the [[eyeline match]] rule in [[continuity editing]]. Truffaut co-wrote ''Breathless'' with Godard.

Godard viewed film-making as an extension of criticism and was more interested in redefining film structure and style than actually being understood by the public. Often his movies were more about the presentation of a story than anything else. The stories in his films were very simple yet unfocused and constantly digressing from the main story line (Jean-Luc Godard and Vivre Sa Vie by Tom Milne, 1962).

From the beginning of his career, Godard included more film references into his movies than did any of his New Wave colleagues. In ''Breathless'', his citations include a movie poster showing [[Humphrey Bogart]], -from ''[[The Harder They Fall]]'', his last film-,<ref>Brody, p. 70.</ref> (whose expression the lead actor Jean-Paul Belmondo tries reverently to imitate); visual quotations from films of [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Samuel Fuller]], [[Fritz Lang]], and others; and an onscreen dedication to [[Monogram Pictures]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2013/07/02/jean-luc-godards-breathless/|title=MoMA|publisher=}}</ref> an American [[B-movie]] studio. Quotations from, and references to literature include [[William Faulkner]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[Louis Aragon]], [[Rilke]], [[Françoise Sagan]], [[Maurice Sachs]]. The film also contains citations in images or on the soundtrack—[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Auguste Renoir]]. "This first-person cinema invoked not the director's experience but his presence".<ref>Brody, p. 71.</ref> If, in Rohmer's words, "life was the cinema", then a film filled with movie references was supremely autobiographical.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[image:Bresson.jpg|thumb|upright| [[Robert Bresson]] (above). Godard told a journalist, "I really made it [''[[Le Petit Soldat]]''] under the influence of Bresson and of Malraux."  Bresson's 1959 film ''[[Pickpocket (film)|Pickpocket]]'' was a model for Godard and had "an effect on Godard's work that was profound and enduring".<ref>Brody, p. 97.</ref>]]

Godard wanted to hire the American actress Jean Seberg, who was living in Paris with her husband François Moreuil, an attorney, to play the American woman. Seberg had become famous in 1956 when [[Otto Preminger]] had chosen her to play [[Joan of Arc]] in his ''[[Saint Joan (film)|Saint Joan]]'', and had then cast her in his acidulous 1958 adaptation of ''[[Bonjour Tristesse (film)|Bonjour Tristesse]]''.<ref>Brody, p. 54.</ref> Her performance in this film had not been generally regarded as a success—the ''New York Times'' critic called her a "misplaced amateur"—but Truffaut and Godard disagreed. In the role of Michel Poiccard, Godard cast Belmondo, an actor he had already called, writing in ''Arts'' in 1958, "the [[Michel Simon]] and the [[Jules Berry]] of tomorrow."<ref>''Godard on Godard'', p. 150.</ref> The cameraman was [[Raoul Coutard]], the producer Beauregard's choice. Godard wanted ''Breathless'' to be shot like a documentary, with a lightweight handheld camera and a minimum of added lighting and Coutard had had experience as a documentary cameraman while working for the French army's information service in Indochina during the [[French-Indochina War]]. Tracking shots were filmed by Coutard from a wheelchair pushed by Godard. Though he had prepared a traditional screenplay, he dispensed with it and Godard wrote the dialogue day by day as the production went ahead.<ref>Brody, p. 60.</ref> The film's importance was recognized immediately and in January 1960, Godard won the [[Prix Jean Vigo|Jean Vigo Prize]], awarded " to encourage an [[auteur theory|auteur]] of the future". One reviewer mentioned [[Alexandre Astruc]]'s prophecy of the age of the ''caméra-stylo'', the camera that a new generation would use with the efficacy with which a writer uses his pen—"here is in fact the first work authentically written with a ''caméra-stylo''{{-"}}.<ref>Brody, pp. 72–73.</ref>

[[Image:Anna karina2.jpg|thumb|[[Anna Karina]]—having rejected a role in ''Breathless'' she appeared in Godard's next film ''Le Petit Soldat''—"it will be something about torture" Godard told ''[[France-Observateur]]''—and concerned France's war in Algeria]]

The following year Godard made ''[[Le Petit Soldat]]'' (The Little Soldier), filmed on location in [[Geneva]],<ref>Brody, p. 89.</ref> and dealing with the [[Algerian War of Independence]]. The film begins on 13 May 1958, the date of the [[May 1958 crisis|attempted putsch in Algeria]], and ends later the same month. In the film, Bruno Forestier a photojournalist who has links with a right wing paramilitary group working for the French government, is ordered to murder a professor accused of aiding the Algerian resistance. He is in love with Veronica Dreyer, a young woman who has worked with the Algerian fighters. He is captured by Algerian militants and tortured. His organisation captures and tortures her. The 'little soldier' was played by [[Michel Subor]] and Veronica Dreyer by [[Anna Karina]]—the first collaboration between Godard and the Danish-born—of Russian extraction—actress. Unlike Seberg, Karina had virtually no experience as an actress and Godard used her awkwardness as an element of her performance. He wrote the dialogue every day and, since it was filmed without direct sound and was dubbed, called dialogue to the actors. Forestier was a character close to Godard himself, an image-maker and intellectual, 'more or less my spokesman, but not totally' Godard told an interviewer.<ref>Brody, p. 92.</ref> The film, due to its political nature, implied that France was involved in a dirty war, engaging in torture, and was banned by the French government until January 1963. Godard and Karina were a couple by the end of the shoot. She appeared again, along with Belmondo, in Godard's first color film, ''[[A Woman Is a Woman]]'' (1961), which was intended as a homage to the [[Musical Film|American musical]]. Adjustments that Godard made to the original version of the story gave it autobiographical resonances, 'specifically in regard to his relationship with Anna Karina'. The film revealed  'the confinement within the four walls of domestic life', and 'the emotional and artistic fault lines that threatened their relationship'.<ref>Brody, p. 110.</ref>

Godard's next film, ''[[Vivre sa vie]]'' (My Life to Live) (1962), was one of his most popular among critics. Karina starred as Nana, an errant mother and aspiring actress whose financially strained circumstances lead her to the life of a streetwalker. It is an episodic account of her rationalizations to prove she is free, even though she is tethered at the end of her pimp's short leash. In one touching scene in a cafe, she spreads her arms out and announces she is free to raise or lower them as she wishes.

''[[Les Carabiniers]]'' (1963) was about the horror of war and its inherent injustice. It was the influence and suggestion of [[Roberto Rossellini]] that led Godard to make this film which follows two peasants who join the army of a king, only to find futility in the whole thing as the king reveals the deception of war-administrating leaders.
His most commercially successful film was ''[[Contempt (film)|Le Mépris]]'' (''Contempt'') (1963), starring [[Michel Piccoli]] and one of France's biggest female stars, [[Brigitte Bardot]]. A coproduction between [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and France, ''Contempt'' became known as a pinnacle in cinematic [[modernism]] with its profound reflexivity. The film follows Paul (Piccoli), a screenwriter who is commissioned by the arrogant American movie producer Prokosch ([[Jack Palance]]) to rewrite the script for an adaptation of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', which the Austrian director [[Fritz Lang]] has been filming. Lang's '[[high culture]]' interpretation of the story is lost on Prokosch, whose character is a firm indictment of the commercial motion picture hierarchy. Another prominent theme is the inability to reconcile love and labor, which is illustrated by Paul's crumbling marriage to Camille (Bardot) during the course of shooting.

In 1964, Godard and Karina formed a production company, Anouchka Films. He directed ''[[Bande à part (film)|Bande à part]]'' (''Band of Outsiders''), another collaboration between the two and described by Godard as "''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' meets [[Franz Kafka]]." It follows two young men, looking to score on a heist, who both fall in love with Karina, and quotes from several [[gangster film]] conventions.

''[[Une femme mariée]]'' (A Married Woman) (1964) followed ''Band of Outsiders''. It was a slow, deliberate, toned-down black-and-white picture without a real story. The film was shot in four weeks<ref>[[Luc Moullet]], ''Masters of Cinema'' #4, booklet p. 10.</ref> and was "an explicitly and stringently modernist film". It showed Godard's "engagement with the most advanced thinking of the day, as expressed in the work of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Roland Barthes]]" and its fragmentation and abstraction reflected also "his loss of faith in the familiar [[Hollywood]] styles." <ref>Brody, pp. 190–191.</ref> Godard made the film while he acquired funding for ''[[Pierrot le fou]]'' (1965).

In 1965, Godard directed ''[[Alphaville (film)|Alphaville]]'', a futuristic blend of science fiction, [[film noir]], and satire. [[Eddie Constantine]] starred as [[Lemmy Caution]], a detective who is sent into a city controlled by a giant computer named Alpha 60. His mission is to make contact with Professor von Braun ([[Howard Vernon]]), a famous scientist who has fallen mysteriously silent, and is believed to be suppressed by the computer. ''[[Pierrot le fou]]'' (1965) featured a complex storyline, distinctive personalities, and a violent ending. [[Gilles Jacob]], an author, critic, and president of the [[Cannes Film Festival]], called it both a "retrospective" and recapitulation in the way it played on so many of Godard's earlier characters and themes. With an extensive cast and variety of locations, the film was expensive enough to warrant significant problems with funding. Shot in color, it departed from Godard's minimalist works (typified by ''Breathless'', ''Vivre sa vie'', and ''Une femme mariée''). He solicited the participation of Jean-Paul Belmondo, by then a famous actor, in order to guarantee the necessary amount of capital.

''[[Masculin, féminin]]'' (1966), based on two [[Guy de Maupassant]] stories, ''La Femme de Paul'' and ''Le Signe'', was a study of contemporary French youth and their involvement with cultural politics. An intertitle refers to the characters as "The children of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Coca-Cola]]." Although Godard's cinema is sometimes thought to depict a wholly masculine point of view, Phillip John Usher has demonstrated how the film, by the way it connects images and disparate events, seems to blur gender lines.<ref name="test">Usher, Phillip John. (2009). [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/french_forum/v034/34.2.usher.html "De sexe incertain: Masculin, Féminin de Godard"]. ''French Forum'', vol. 34, no. 2, pp. 97–112.</ref>

Godard followed with ''[[Made in U.S.A. (1966 film)|Made in U.S.A]]'' (1966), whose source material was [[Richard Stark]]'s ''The Jugger''; and ''[[Two or Three Things I Know About Her]]'' (1967), in which [[Marina Vlady]] portrays a woman leading a double life as housewife and prostitute. A Classic New Wave crime thiller, "Made in the U.S.A" is inspired by American Noir films. [[Anna Karina]] stars as the anti-hero searching for her murdered lover; the film includes a cameo by [[Marianne Faithfull]].

''[[La Chinoise]]'' (1967) saw Godard at his most politically forthright so far. The film focused on a group of students and engaged with the ideas coming out of the student activist groups in contemporary France. Released just before the May 1968 events, the film is thought by some to foreshadow the student rebellions that took place.

That same year, Godard made a more colorful and political film, ''[[Week End (1967 film)|Week End]]''. It follows a Parisian couple as they leave on a weekend trip across the French countryside to collect an inheritance. What ensues is a confrontation with the tragic flaws of the over-consuming bourgeoisie. The film contains some of the most written-about scenes in cinema's history. One of them, an eight-minute [[tracking shot]] of the couple stuck in an unremitting traffic jam as they leave the city, is cited as a new technique Godard used to deconstruct bourgeois trends.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Kby7RaRmTt4C&pg=PA72|title=Jean-Luc Godard|first=Douglas|last=Morrey|year=2005}}</ref>  Startlingly, a few shots contain extra footage from, as it were, before the beginning of the take (while the actors are preparing) and after the end of the take (while the actors are coming out of character). ''Week End'''s enigmatic and audacious end title sequence, which reads "End of Cinema", appropriately marked an end to the narrative and cinematic period in Godard's filmmaking career.

=== Politics ===
Politics are never far from the surface in Godard's films. One of his earliest features, ''Le Petit Soldat'', dealt with the [[Algerian War of Independence]], and was notable for its attempt to present the complexity of the dispute rather than pursue any specific ideological agenda. Along these lines, ''Les Carabiniers'' presents a fictional war that is initially romanticized in the way its characters approach their service, but becomes a stiff anti-war [[Metonymy|metonym]]. In addition to the international conflicts Godard sought an artistic response to, he was also very concerned with the social problems in France. The earliest and best example of this is Karina's potent portrayal of a prostitute in ''Vivre sa vie''.

In 1960s Paris, the political milieu was not overwhelmed by one specific movement. There was, however, a distinct post-war climate shaped by various international conflicts such as the colonialism in North Africa and Southeast Asia. The side that opposed such colonization included the majority of French workers, who belonged to the French communist party, and the Parisian artists and writers who positioned themselves on the side of social reform and class equality. A large portion of this group had a particular affinity for the teachings of [[Karl Marx]]. [[Jean-Luc Godard#Marxism|Godard's Marxist disposition]] did not become abundantly explicit until ''La Chinoise'' and ''Week End'', but is evident in several films—namely ''Pierrot'' and ''Une femme mariée''.

Godard has been accused by some of harboring [[anti-Semitic]] views: in 2010, in the lead-up to the presentation of Godard's honorary Oscar, a prominent article in the New York Times by Michael Cieply drew attention to the idea, which had been circulating through press in previous weeks, that Godard might be an anti-Semite, and thus undeserving of the accolade. Cieply makes reference to [[Richard Brody]]'s book, "Everything is Cinema: The Working Life of Jean-Luc Godard", and alluded to a previous, longer article published by the Jewish Journal as lying near the origin of the debate.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/movies/02godard.html |title=An Honorary Oscar Revives a Controversy |author=Michael Cieply |date=1 November 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2011 |work=New York Times}}</ref> The article also draws upon Brody's book, for example in the following quotation, which Godard made on television in 1981: "Moses is my principal enemy...Moses, when he received the commandments, he saw images and translated them. Then he brought the texts, he didn't show what he had seen. That's why the Jewish people are accursed."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/cover_story/article/jean-luc_godard_to_get_honorary_oscar_questions_of_anti-semitism_remain_201 |title=Is Jean-Luc Godard an anti-Semite? |author=TOM TUGEND |date=6 October 2010 |accessdate=9 May 2012 |work=The Jewish Journal}}</ref>  Immediately after Cieply's article was published, Brody made a clear point of criticizing the "extremely selective and narrow use" of passages in his book, and noted that Godard's work has approached the Holocaust with "the greatest moral seriousness".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2010/11/the-oscar-question.html |title=Jean-Luc Godard: The Oscar Question |date=2 November 2010 |accessdate=27 January 2011 |author=Richard Brody |work=The Front Row}}</ref> Indeed, his documentaries feature images from the Holocaust in a context suggesting he considers Nazism and the Holocaust as the nadir of human history. Godard's views become more complex regarding the State of Israel. In 1970, Godard traveled to the Middle East to make a pro-Palestinian film he didn't complete and whose footage eventually became part of the 1976 film ''[[Ici et ailleurs]]''. In this film, Godard seems to view the Palestinian cause as one of many worldwide Leftist revolutionary movements. Elsewhere, Godard has explicitly identified himself as an anti-Zionist but has denied the accusations of anti-Semitism.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/11/jean-luc_godard_says_honorary.html |title=Jean-Luc Godard Says Honorary Oscar Meant ‘Nothing’ to Him |author=Kyle Buchanan |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=9 May 2012 |work=Vulture}}</ref>

==== Vietnam War ====
Godard produced several pieces that directly address the [[Vietnam War]]. Furthermore, there are two scenes in ''[[Pierrot le fou]]'' that tackle the issue. The first is a scene that takes place in the initial car ride between Ferdinand (Belmondo) and Marianne (Karina). Over the car radio, the two hear the message "garrison massacred by the [[Viet Cong]] who lost 115 men". Marianne responds with an extended musing on the way the radio dehumanizes the Northern Vietnamese combatants.

In the same film, the lovers accost a group of American sailors along the course of their liberating crime spree. Their immediate reaction, expressed by Marianne, is "Damn Americans!", an obvious outlet of the frustration so many [[French Communist Party|French communists]] felt towards [[American Empire (term)|American hegemony]]. Ferdinand then reconsiders, "That's OK, we’ll change our politics. We can put on a play. Maybe they’ll give us some dollars." Marianne is puzzled, but Ferdinand suggests that something the Americans would like would be the Vietnam War. The ensuing sequence is a makeshift play where Marianne dresses up as a stereotypical Vietnamese woman and Ferdinand as an [[United States Navy|American sailor]]. The scene ends on a brief shot revealing a chalk message left on the floor by the pair, "Long live [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]!" (''Vive Mao!'').

Notably, he also participated in ''[[Loin du Vietnam]]'' (1967). An anti-war project, it consists of seven sketches directed by Godard (who used [[stock footage]] from ''La Chinoise''), [[Claude Lelouch]], [[Joris Ivens]], [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]], [[Chris Marker]], [[Alain Resnais]] and [[Agnès Varda]].

=== Bertolt Brecht ===
Godard's engagement with German poet and playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]] stems primarily from his attempt to transpose Brecht's theory of [[epic theatre]] and its prospect of alienating the viewer (''[[Verfremdungseffekt]]'') through a radical separation of the elements of the medium (in Brecht's case theater, but in Godard's, film). Brecht's influence is keenly felt through much of Godard's work, particularly before 1980, when Godard used filmic expression for specific political ends.

For example, ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]''' elliptical editing, which denies the viewer a fluid narrative typical of mainstream cinema, forces the viewers to take on more critical roles, connecting the pieces themselves and coming away with more investment in the work's content. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Godard also employs other devices, including asynchronous sound and alarming title frames, with perhaps his favorite being the character aside. In many of his most political pieces, specifically ''[[Week End (1967 film)|Week End]]'', ''[[Pierrot le fou]]'', and ''[[La Chinoise]]'', characters address the audience with thoughts, feelings, and instructions.

=== Marxism ===
{{See also|Karl Marx in film}}
A [[Marxist theory|Marxist]] reading is possible with most if not all of Godard's early work. Godard's direct interaction with [[Marxism]] does not become explicitly apparent, however, until ''Week End'', where the name ''[[Karl Marx]]'' is cited in conjunction with figures such as [[Jesus Christ]]. A constant refrain throughout Godard's cinematic period is that of the bourgeoisie's [[consumerism]], the commodification of daily life and activity, and man's [[social alienation|alienation]]—all central features of Marx's critique of capitalism.

In an essay on Godard, philosopher and aesthetics scholar [[Jacques Rancière]] states, "When in ''Pierrot le fou'', 1965, a film without a clear political message, Belmondo played on the word 'scandal' and the 'freedom' that the Scandal girdle supposedly offered women, the context of a Marxist critique of [[commodification]], of [[pop art]] derision at consumerism, and of a feminist denunciation of women's false 'liberation', was enough to foster a [[dialectics#Marxist dialectics|dialectical]] reading of the joke and the whole story." The way Godard treated politics in his cinematic period was in the context of a joke, a piece of art, or a relationship, presented to be used as tools of reference, romanticizing the Marxist rhetoric, rather than being solely tools of education.

''[[Une femme mariée]]'' is also structured around Marx's concept of ''[[commodity fetishism]]''. Godard once said that it is "a film in which individuals are considered as things, in which chases in a taxi alternate with ethological interviews, in which the spectacle of life is intermingled with its analysis". He was very conscious of the way he wished to portray the human being. His efforts are overtly characteristic of Marx, who in his ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/preface.htm Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]'' gives one of his most nuanced elaborations, analyzing how the worker is alienated from his product, the object of his productive activity. [[Georges Sadoul]], in his short rumination on the film, describes it as a "sociological study of the alienation of the modern woman".

== Revolutionary period (1968–79)==
The period that spans from May 1968 indistinctly into the 1970s has been subject to an even larger volume of varying labeling. They include everything from his "militant" period, to his "radical" period, along with terms as specific as "[[Maoism|Maoist]]" and vague as "political". The period saw Godard align himself with a specific revolution and employ a consistent revolutionary rhetoric.

=== Films ===
Amid the upheavals of the late 1960s, Godard became interested in Maoist ideology. He formed the socialist-idealist [[Dziga Vertov Group|Dziga-Vertov]] cinema group with [[Jean-Pierre Gorin]] and produced a number of shorts outlining his politics. In that period he travelled extensively and shot a number of films, most of which remained unfinished or were refused showings. His films became intensely politicized and experimental, a phase that lasted until 1980.

In 1978 Godard was commissioned by the [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] government to make a short film. During this time his experience with [[Kodak]] film led him to criticize the stock film as "inherently racist" since it did not reflect the variety, nuance or complexity in dark brown or dark [[Human skin color|skin]]. This was because Kodak [[Color chart#Shirley cards|Shirley cards]] were only made for Caucasian subjects, a problem that was not rectified until 1995.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/04/16/303721251/light-and-dark-the-racial-biases-that-remain-in-photography National Public Radio. Light And Dark: The Racial Biases That Remain In Photography (April 16, 2014)]</ref>

According to [[Elliott Gould]], he and Godard met to discuss the possibility of Godard's directing [[Jules Feiffer]]'s 1971 surrealist play ''[[Little Murders]]''. During this meeting, Godard said his two favorite American writers were Feiffer and [[Charles M. Schulz]]. Godard soon declined the opportunity to direct; the job later went to [[Alan Arkin]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

=== Jean-Pierre Gorin ===
After the events of [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]], when the city of Paris saw total upheaval in response to the "authoritarian [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]", and Godard's professional objective was reconsidered, he began to collaborate with like-minded individuals in the filmmaking arena. The most notable of these collaborations was with a young Maoist student, [[Jean-Pierre Gorin]], who displayed a passion for cinema that grabbed Godard's attention.

Between 1968 and 1973, Godard and Gorin collaborated to make a total of five films with strong Maoist messages. The most prominent film from the collaboration was ''[[Tout va bien]]'', which starred [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Yves Montand]], at the time very big stars. Jean-Pierre Gorin now teaches the [[film theory|study of film]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

=== The Dziga Vertov group ===
The small group of Maoists that Godard had brought together, which included Gorin, adopted the name [[Dziga Vertov Group]]. Godard had a specific interest in [[Dziga Vertov|Vertov]], a Soviet filmmaker—whose adopted name is derived from the verb to spin or rotate<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=N-T_ogXMzlgC&pg=PR18&lpg=PR18&dq=dziga+vertov+name&source=bl&ots=2inAVyeqdb&sig=7hu5v6H1SaQvuSra3zEYzzOCiJI&hl=en&ei=QtA3SrX7JsKltgfKguTiDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8#PPR17,M1 |title=Kino-eye: the writings of Dziga Vertov|publisher=Google Books |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> and is best remembered for ''[[Man with the Movie Camera]]'' (1929) and a contemporary of both the great Soviet [[Film editing|montage]] theorists, most notably [[Sergei Eisenstein]], and Russian [[constructivism (art)|constructivist]] and [[Russian avant garde|avant-garde]] artists such as [[Alexander Rodchenko]] and [[Vladimir Tatlin]]. Part of Godard's political shift after May 1968 was toward a proactive participation in the [[class struggle]].

=== Sonimage ===
In 1972, Godard and Swiss filmmaker [[Anne-Marie Miéville]] started the alternative video production and distribution company Sonimage, based in Grenoble.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean-Luc Godard|url=http://www.eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=345|publisher=[[Electronic Arts Intermix]]|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> Under Sonimage, Godard produced both ''Numéro Deux'' (1975) and "Sauve qui peut (la vie)" (1980). In 1976, Godard and Miéville, his wife,<ref>{{cite web|title=Anne-Marie Mieville|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594746/bio|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> collaborated on a series of innovative video works for European broadcast television called "[[Six fois deux/Sur et sous la communication]]" (1976)<ref>{{cite web|title=Six Fois Deux / Sur et Sous La Communication [TV Documentary Series]|url=http://www.fandango.com/sixfoisdeuxsuretsouslacommunication%5Btvdocumentaryseries%5D_v44940/plotsummary|publisher=Fandango|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> and "France/tour/détour/deux/enfants" (1978).

== 1980–present ==
Godard's return to somewhat more traditional fiction was marked with ''[[Sauve qui peut (la vie)]]'' (1980), the first of a series of more mainstream films marked by autobiographical currents: for example ''[[Passion (1982 film)|Passion]]'' (1982), ''[[Lettre à Freddy Buache]]'' (1982), ''[[Prénom Carmen]]'' (1984), and ''[[Grandeur et décadence d'un petit commerce de cinéma]]'' (1986). There was, though, another flurry of controversy with ''[[Je vous salue, Marie]]'' (1985), which was condemned by the Catholic Church for alleged [[heresy]], and also with ''[[King Lear (1987 film)|King Lear]]'' (1987), an extraordinary but much-excoriated essay on [[William Shakespeare]] and language. Also completed in 1987 was a segment in the film [[Aria (film)|ARIA]] which was based loosely from the plot of [[Armida|Armide]]; it is set in a gym and uses several [[aria]]s by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] from his famous [[Armide (Lully)|Armide]].

His later films have been marked by great formal beauty and frequently a sense of requiem—''[[Nouvelle Vague (film)|Nouvelle Vague]]'' (New Wave, 1990), the autobiographical ''[[JLG/JLG – Self-Portrait in December|JLG/JLG, autoportrait de décembre]]'' (''JLG/JLG: Self-Portrait in December'', 1995), and ''[[For Ever Mozart]]'' (1996). ''[[Allemagne année 90 neuf zéro]]'' (''Germany Year 90 Nine Zero'', 1991) was a quasi-sequel to ''Alphaville'' but done with an elegiac tone and focus on the inevitable decay of age. Between 1988 and 1998 he produced perhaps the most important work of his career in the multi-part series ''[[Histoire(s) du cinéma]]'', a monumental project which combined all the innovations of his video work with a passionate engagement in the issues of twentieth-century history and the history of film itself.

In 2001, [[In Praise of Love (film)|''In Praise of Love'' (''Éloge de l'amour'')]] was released. The film is notable for its use of both film and video—the first half captured in 35-mm black and white, the latter half shot in color on DV—and subsequently transferred to film for editing. The blending of film and video recalls the statement from ''Sauve Qui Peut'', in which the tension between film and video evokes the struggle between Cain and Abel. The film is also noted for containing themes of aging, love, separation, and rediscovery as it follows the young artist Edgar in his contemplation of a new work on the four stages of love.

In ''[[Notre musique]]'' (2004), Godard turned his focus to war, specifically, the [[Siege of Sarajevo|war in Sarajevo]], but with attention to all war, including the [[American Civil War]], the war between the [[American Indian Wars|US and Native Americans]], and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. The film is structured into three [[Dante Alighieri|Dantean]] kingdoms: [[Divine Comedy|Hell, Purgatory and Paradise]]. Godard's fascination with paradox is a constant in the film. It opens with a long, ponderous montage of war images that occasionally lapses into the comic; Paradise is shown as a lush wooded beach patrolled by [[US Marines]].

Godard's film, ''[[Film Socialisme]]'', premiered in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justpressplay.net/movies/movie-news/5284-new-godard-qsocialismeq.html |title=New Godard: "Socialisme" |publisher=Justpressplay.net |date=8 May 2009 |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref><ref name="hollywoodreporter">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/world/news/e3i3d82e5b089623802884efcd38a037f67?pn=2 |title=Hollywood Reporter: Cannes Lineup |accessdate=16 April 2010 |work=[[Hollywood Reporter]]|deadurl=yes |first=Rebecca |last=Leffler |date=15 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> It was released theatrically in France in May 2010.
