'''George Andrew Romero''' ({{IPAc-en|r|ə|'|m|ɛr|oʊ}}; born February 4, 1940) is an American-Canadian [[film director]], [[film producer]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film editing|editor]], best known for his [[Night of the Living Dead (film series)|series]] of gruesome and satirical [[horror film]]s about a hypothetical [[zombie apocalypse]], beginning with ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968).<ref name="PM">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/159439-legacy-of-the-living-dead/|author=J.C.

== Life and career ==
Romero was born in New York City borough of [[The Bronx]], to a [[Cubans|Cuban]]-born father and a [[Lithuanian American]] mother.<ref>[http://www.genreonline.net/GENRE_ONLINE_Interview_George_Romero.html The GENRE ONLINE.NET Interview - Writer and Director George A.

After graduating in 1960,<ref>[http://www.pabook.libraries.psu.edu/LitMap/bios/Romero__George.html George Romero<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> he began his career shooting short films and commercials. One of his early commercial films, a segment for ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' in which Mr. Rogers underwent a [[tonsillectomy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diamonddead.com/diary/view.php?s=YToyOntzOjM6ImFpZCI7czoxOiIzIjtzOjI6ImlkIjtzOjI6IjI4Ijt9|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070216005517/http://www.diamonddead.com/diary/view.php?s=YToyOntzOjM6ImFpZCI7czoxOiIzIjtzOjI6ImlkIjtzOjI6IjI4Ijt9|archivedate=2007-02-16|title=Mr. Rogers Gets a Tonsillectomy|accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> inspired Romero to go into the horror film business. He, along with nine friends, formed Image Ten Productions in the late 1960s, and produced ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968). The movie, directed by Romero and co-written with [[John A. Russo]], became a [[cult film|cult classic]] and a defining moment for modern horror cinema.

Other inspiration for Romero's filmmaking, as told to [[Robert K. Elder]] in an interview for ''[[The Film That Changed My Life]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556528256/ref=nosim/wwwrobelderco-20 |title=The Film That Changed My Life: 30 Directors on Their Epiphanies in the Dark: Robert K. Elder: 9781556528255: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref> was the film [[The Tales of Hoffmann (film)|''The Tales of Hoffmann'']].

<blockquote>"It was the filmmaking, the fantasy, the fact that it was a fantasy and it had a few frightening, sort of bizarre things in it. It was everything. It was really a movie for me, and it gave me an early appreciation for the power of visual media—the fact that you could experiment with it. He was doing all his tricks in-camera, and they were sort of obvious. That made me feel that, gee, maybe I could figure this medium out. It was transparent, but it worked".<ref>Romero, George A. Interview by Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life. By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p261. Print.</ref></blockquote>

Three films that followed were less popular: ''[[There's Always Vanilla]]'' (1971), ''[[Season of the Witch (1972 film)|Jack's Wife / Season of the Witch]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Crazies (1973 film)|The Crazies]]'' (1973) were not as well received as ''Night of the Living Dead'' or some of his later work. ''The Crazies'', dealing with a bio spill that induces an epidemic of homicidal madness, and the critically acclaimed arthouse success ''[[Martin (film)|Martin]]'' (1977), a film that deals with the [[vampire]] myth, were the two well-known films from this period. Like many of his films, they were shot in or around [[Pittsburgh]].

In 1978, Romero returned to the [[zombie]] genre with ''[[Dawn of the Dead]]'' (1978). Shot on a budget of just $500,000, the film earned over $55 million worldwide and was named one of the top [[cult film]]s by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' in 2003. Romero made a third entry in his "Dead Series" with ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'' (1985).

Between these two films, Romero shot ''[[Knightriders]]'' (1981), another festival favorite about a group of modern-day jousters who reenact tournaments on motorcycles, and the successful ''[[Creepshow]]'' (1982), written by [[Stephen King]], an anthology of tongue-in-cheek tales modeled after 1950s horror comics.

From the latter half of the 1980s and into the 1990s came ''[[Monkey Shines]]'' (1988), about a killer helper monkey, ''[[Two Evil Eyes]]'' (1990) (aka, "Due occhi Diabolici"), an [[Edgar Allan Poe]] adaptation in collaboration with [[Dario Argento]], ''[[The Dark Half (film)|The Dark Half]]'' (1993) written by [[Stephen King]], and ''[[Bruiser (film)|Bruiser]]'' (2000), about a man whose face becomes a blank mask.

Romero updated his original screenplay and executive produced the remake of ''[[Night of the Living Dead (1990 film)|Night of the Living Dead]]'' directed by [[Tom Savini]] for Columbia/TriStar in 1990. Tom Savini is also responsible for the makeup and special effects in many of Romero's films including Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead, Creepshow and Monkey Shines. Romero had a cameo appearance in [[Jonathan Demme]]'s Academy Award-winning ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' in 1991 as one of Hannibal Lecter's jailers.

In 1998, he directed the live-action commercial promoting the videogame ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The 30-second advertisement featured the game's two main characters, [[Leon S. Kennedy]] and [[Claire Redfield]], fighting a horde of zombies while in [[Raccoon City]]'s Police Station. The project was obvious territory for Romero; the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series has been heavily influenced by Romero's "Dead" projects. The commercial was rather popular and was released in the weeks before the game's actual release, although a contract dispute prevented the commercial from being shown outside Japan. Capcom was so impressed with Romero's work, it was strongly indicated that Romero would direct the first ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' film. He declined at first — "I don't wanna make another film with zombies in it, and I couldn't make a movie based on something that ain't mine"{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} — although in later years, he reconsidered and wrote a script for the first movie. It was eventually rejected in favor of [[Paul W. S. Anderson]]'s version.

[[Universal Studios]] produced and released a remake of ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' in 2004, with which Romero was not involved. Later that year, Romero kicked off the [[DC Comics]] title ''Toe Tags'' with a six-issue miniseries titled ''The Death of Death''. Based on an unused script that Romero had previously written as a sequel to his "Dead Trilogy," the comic miniseries concerns Damien, an intelligent zombie who remembers his former life, struggling to find his identity as he battles armies of both the living and the dead. Typical of a Romero zombie tale, the miniseries includes ample supply of both gore and social commentary (dealing particularly here with corporate greed and terrorism — ideas he would also explore in his next film in the series, ''[[Land of the Dead]]''). Romero has stated that the miniseries is set in the same kind of world as his 'Dead' films, but featured other locales besides Pittsburgh, where the majority of his films take place.<ref>[http://newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=19461 newsarama.com/forums/showthread.php]</ref>

Romero, who lives in Toronto, filmed a fourth "Dead" movie in that city titled ''[[Land of the Dead]]''. The movie's working title was "Dead Reckoning". Its $16 million production budget was the highest of the four movies in the series. Actors [[Simon Baker]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Asia Argento]], and [[John Leguizamo]] star in the film. It was released on June 24, 2005 by Universal Pictures (who released the ''Dawn of the Dead'' remake). The film received generally positive reviews.

Some critics have seen social commentary in much of Romero's work. They view ''Night of the Living Dead'' as a film made in reaction to the turbulent 1960s, ''Dawn of the Dead'' as a satire on [[consumerism]], ''Day of the Dead'' as a study of the conflict between science and the military, and ''Land of the Dead'' as an examination of [[class conflict]].

Romero collaborated with the game company ''Hip Interactive'' in creating a game called ''[[City of the Dead (video game)|City of the Dead]]'', but the game was canceled midway due to the financial problems of the company.

In June 2006, Romero began his next project, called Zombisodes. Broadcast on the Web, they are a combination of a series of "Making of" shorts and story expansion detailing the work behind the film ''[[George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead]]''. Shooting began in Toronto in July 2006.<ref>[http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_8867.html George A. Romero's Next Project]</ref>

In August 2006, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' made two announcements about Romero, the first being that he will write and direct a film based on a short story by [[Koji Suzuki]], author of ''[[Ring (Suzuki novel)|Ring]]'' and ''[[Dark Water (book)|Dark Water]]'', called ''Solitary Isle''<ref>[[Dark Water (book)]] Stories in ''[[Dark Water (book)|Dark Water]]''</ref><ref>[http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=24104 aintitcool.com]</ref> and the second announcement pertaining to his signing on to write and direct ''George A. Romero's Diary of the Dead'', which follows a group of college students filming a horror movie who proceed to film the events that follow when the dead rise.<ref>[http://cinescape.com/0/editorial.asp?aff_id=0&this_cat=Movies&action=page&type_id=&cat_id=270338&obj_id=52080 cinescape]</ref><ref>[http://aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=24404 aintitcool.com]</ref> The film was independently financed, making it the first indie zombie film Romero has made in years.

After a limited theatrical release, ''Diary of the Dead'' was released on DVD by Dimension Extreme on May 20, 2008, and later to [[Blu-ray Disc]] on October 21, 2008.

Shooting began in Toronto in September 2008 on Romero's ''[[Survival of the Dead]]''. The film was initially reported to be a direct sequel to ''Diary of the Dead'', but the film features only Alan Van Sprang, who appeared briefly as a rogue National Guard officer, reprising his role from the previous film, and did not retain the first-person camerawork of ''Diary of the Dead''. The film centered on two feuding families taking very different approaches in dealing with the living dead on a small coastal island. The film premiered at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Prior to the May 28, 2010 theatrical release in the United States, ''Survival of the Dead'' was made available to [[Video on Demand]] and was aired as a special one night showing May 26, 2010 on [[HDNet]].

Romero made an appearance in the second downloadable map pack called "Escalation" for the video game ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]''. He appears as himself in the zombies map "Call of the Dead" as a non-playable enemy character. Romero is featured alongside actors [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Danny Trejo]], [[Michael Rooker]], and [[Robert Englund]], all of the four being playable characters. He is portrayed as a powerful "boss" zombie armed with a movie studio light.

In 2010 Romero was contacted by [[Claudio Argento]] to direct a 3D remake of the [[Dario Argento]] film, ''[[Deep Red]]''. Claudio was expected to write the screenplay and told Romero that his brother Dario would also be involved. Romero, who showed interest in the project, decided to contact his longtime friend Dario only to find out that Dario was unaware of remake and Romero ended up declining Claudio's offer. Romero has stated that he has plans for two more Dead movies which will be connected to ''Diary of the Dead'' and they will be made depending on how successful ''Survival of the Dead'' was. Romero however said that his next project would not involve zombies and he is going for the scare factor, but offered no further details.<ref>

In 2012, Romero returned to video games recording his voice for "Zombie Squash" as the lead villain, Dr. B. E. Vil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zombie Squash (Video Game 2012) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2202220/|publisher=IMDb.com}}</ref> "Zombie Squash HD Free" game was released by ACW Games for the iPad in November 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Romero’s Zombie Squash Game is Now Available for the iPad|url=http://dailydead.com/george-romeros-zombie-squash-game-is-now-available-for-the-ipad/|publisher=DailyDead.com}}</ref>

In 2014, [[Marvel Comics]] began releasing ''[[Empire of the Dead]]'', a 15-issue miniseries written by Romero. The series, which is broken up into three five-issues acts, features not only zombies but also vampires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/19346-romero-zombies-don-t-run-in-marvel-s-empire-of-the-dead.html |title=ROMERO Zombies Don't Run in Marvel's EMPIRE OF THE DEAD |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=22 October 2013 |first=Zack |last=Smith }}</ref>  In May 2015, it was announced at Cannes that the production company Demarest was developing the comic series in to a TV series.  The series will be written and executive produced by Romero and [[Peter Grunwald]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/george-a-romero-empire-of-the-dead-tv-series-1201502364/ |title=Cannes: George A.

== Personal life ==
Romero is divorced from Christine Forrest, whom he met on the set of ''Season of the Witch''. They have three children together. Romero currently lives in [[Toronto]] with his wife, Suzanne Desrocher, whom he met while filming ''Land of the Dead.''  They married in September 2011 on [[Martha's Vineyard]].<ref>http://www.scifimoviepage.com/art_landof.html</ref> His son Cameron, is a filmmaker,<ref>[http://www.slashfilm.com/night-of-the-living-dead-prequel-origins/ George Romero’s Son Cameron Crowdfunding ‘Night of the Living Dead’ Prequel ‘Origins’]</ref> who filmed 2015 the film ''Origins'',<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/87191/cameron-romeros-night-living-dead-prequel-origins-headed-way/ Cameron Romero’s Night of the Living Dead Prequel Origins Headed Our Way]</ref> which is the sequel to his ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.

== Influences ==
Romero ranked his top ten films of all time for the 2002 ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' Greatest Films Poll. They are ''[[The Brothers Karamazov (1958 film)|The Brothers Karamazov]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', ''[[High Noon]]'', ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1950 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]'', ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (a film on which a teenaged Romero worked as a [[gofer]]), ''[[The Quiet Man]]'', ''[[Repulsion]]'', ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' and ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann (film)|The Tales of Hoffman]]n''. Romero listed the films in alphabetical order, with special placement given to ''The Tales of Hoffman'', which he cites as "my favourite film of all time; the movie that made me want to make movies."<ref>[http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=George+A.&surname=Romero BFI - Sight & Sound Top Ten Poll 2002]</ref>
