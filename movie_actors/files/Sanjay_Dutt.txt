'''Sanjay Balraj Dutt''' (born 29 July 1959) is an Indian film actor, producer known for his work in [[Hindi cinema]]. He was briefly associated with politics. Dutt, son of film actors [[Sunil Dutt]] and [[Nargis Dutt]], made his acting debut in 1981. Since then he has acted in some of the most popular Hindi language films. Although Dutt has enjoyed major success in movie genres ranging from romance to comedy, it has been the roles of gangsters, thugs and police officers in films that have won Dutt much adulation, with fans and Indian film critics alike referring to him as the "Deadly Dutt," for his larger-than-life portrayals of such characters.

Dutt was arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act (TADA) in April 1993, due to terrorist interactions, and illegal possession of a 9mm pistol and an AK-56 assault rifle. After spending 18 months in jail, he was granted bail in April 1995. In July 2007 he was sentenced to six years rigorous imprisonment. The [[Supreme Court of India]], in a judgement on 21 March 2013, convicted Dutt of illegal possession of arms relating to the [[1993 Bombay bombings|1993 Mumbai blasts]] case and sentenced him to five years imprisonment.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sanjay-Dutt-gets-5-years-in-jail-in-1993-Mumbai-blasts-case/articleshow/19104492.cms | title=Sanjay Dutt gets 5 years in jail in 1993 Mumbai blasts case | publisher=[[The Times of India]] | work=Dhananjay Mahapatra, | date=21  March 2013 | accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/21/sanjay-dutt-jail-mumbai-bombings | title=Sanjay Dutt ordered to finish jail sentence over 1993 Mumbai bombings | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | work=Maseeh Rahman | date=21  March 2013 | accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-21873316 | title=Sanjay Dutt: Bollywood actor sent back to jail for 1993 Mumbai blasts | publisher=BBC | date=21 March 2013 | accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>

==Film career==

===1972–1993===
As a child actor, Dutt appeared in the 1972 film ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'', which starred his father; he appears briefly as a qawali singer. Dutt made his [[Bollywood]] movie debut with ''[[Rocky (1981 film)|Rocky]]'' in 1981. He went on to star in ''[[Vidhaata]]'', the highest grossing Hindi film of 1982. In 1985 he shot for his first film in three years, ''Jaan Ki Baazi''. Dutt appeared in successful films such as ''[[Main Awara Hoon]]'' (1983), ''[[Jeeva (1986 film)|Jeeva]]'' (1986), ''[[Mera Haque]]'' (1986), ''Imaandaar'', ''[[Inaam Dus Hazaar]]'' (1987), ''[[Jeete Hain Shaan Se]]'' (1987), ''[[Mardon Wali Baat]]'' (1988), ''[[Ilaaka]]'' (1989), ''[[Hum Bhi Insaan Hain (1989 film)|Hum Bhi Insaan Hain]]'' (1989), ''[[Kanoon Apna Apna]]'' (1989), and ''[[Taaqatwar]]'' (1989).

The 1986 film ''[[Naam]]'' was Dutt's first major critical success, earning praise for his sensitive portrayal of lead character Vicky Kapoor. He also received critical acclaim for his performances in [[Mahesh Bhatt]]'s ''[[Kabzaa]]'' and [[J. P. Dutta]]'s 1989 ''[[Hathyar (1989 film)|Hathyar]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sanjay received critical acclaim for Kabzaa|url=http://www.stargold.in/newsdetails.aspx?nid=4451|publisher=stargold.in|accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sanjay received critical acclaim for Kabzaa And Hathyar|url=http://movies.addatoday.com/2012/05/about-sanjay-dutt-biography.html|publisher=movies.addatoday.com|accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref>  In the late 80s he was seen in a number of films alongside actors like [[Govinda]], [[Mithun Chakraborty|Mithun]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Jackie Shroff]] and [[Sunny Deol]].

His successes continued in the early 1990s, with films that include ''[[Tejaa]]'', ''[[khatarnak]]'', ''[[Zahreelay]]'', ''[[Thanedaar]]'', ''[[Khoon Ka Karz]]'', ''[[Yalgaar (India film)|Yalgaar]]'', ''[[Gumrah (1993 film)|Gumrah]]'', ''[[Sahibaan]]'', and ''[[Aatish: Feel the Fire]]''. He went on to star in some of the most era-defining Indian films of the 1990s such as ''[[Sadak]]'', ''[[Saajan]]'' (for which he was nominated for the [[Filmfare Best Actor Award]]) and ''[[Khal Nayak]]'', for which he earned his second Filmfare Best Actor Award nomination. Three weeks before its release, however, in April 1993, he was arrested, charged with involvement in the [[1993 Mumbai bomb blasts case|1993 Mumbai bombings]].

===1999–2015===
Dutt began 1999 by starring in the Mahesh Bhatt directed hit ''[[Kartoos]]'' along with ''[[Khoobsurat (1999 film)|Khoobsurat]]'', ''[[Daag: The Fire]]'', ''[[Haseena Maan Jayegi]]'' and the award winning ''[[Vaastav: The Reality]]'', for which he won his first Filmfare Best Actor Award. His role in 2000's ''[[Mission Kashmir]]'' won him critical acclaim and a number of awards and nominations, as did his subsequent performance in ''[[Kurukshetra (2000 film)|Kurukshetra]]''. As the decade went on, he continued to play important roles in popular and critical successes such as ''[[Jodi No.1]]'' (2001), ''[[Pitaah]]'' (2002), ''[[Kaante]]'' (2002) and the National Award-winning blockbuster ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]'' (2003), which garnered him several awards. Later successes came with ''[[Musafir (2004 film)|Musafir]]'' (2004), ''[[Plan]]'' (2004), ''[[Parineeta (2005 film)|Parineeta]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dus]]'' (2005). He won critical acclaim for his performances in ''[[Shabd (film)|Shabd]]'' (2005) and ''[[Zinda (film)|Zinda]]'' (2006).{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The blockbuster sequel ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]'' released in late 2006. He received a number of awards for his performance in the film along with an award from the Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] for his work in the ''Munna bhai'' series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sanjay Received award by PM|url=http://www.in.com/sanjay-dutt/biography-284.html|publisher=www.in.com|accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref> In the same year news channel NDTV named him Indian of the Year. He also sang and danced in a Music Video with Asha Bhosle called ''[[Asha and Friends]]'' directed by S Ramachandran. Although he was going through a successful time professionally and receiving great acclaim for his performance in ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]'' this coincided with the start of the Mumbai bombing's trial. The nation became transfixed with Dutt's court ongoings which saw him found not guilty of terrorism related acts but jailed on two occasions between 2006–2007 for short periods, as he was found guilty 'under the possession of arms act'. He was granted bail enabling him to star in successes like ''[[Dhamaal]]'' (2007) and ''[[Shootout at Lokhandwala]]'' (2007). In January 2008, Indian film institute Filmfare listed 12 movies featuring Dutt in its top 100 grossing movies of all time list. He also continued working as an actor although on police bail terms. He also played a supporting character in the Bollywood film [[PK (film)|PK]] {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
