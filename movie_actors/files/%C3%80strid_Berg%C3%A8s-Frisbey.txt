Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey was born in Barcelona, Spain, to a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] father and a [[French-American]] mother. She is the eldest among three daughters. Following her parents divorce when she was 2 years old, she moved to southwestern France at age 5. She was raised in a small town near [[La Rochelle]], where she acted in school plays as a hobby, but never saw acting as a possible career path as the countryside where she lived was very different from the movie industry, <ref>http://tommy2.net/content/?p=29835</ref> describing how she thought acting was "not a profession; it was something abstract". <ref>http://smoda.elpais.com/articulos/promesa-cumplida/451</ref> Her father later moved to the [[Dominican Republic]], where she spent five summers working as a waitress. At age 17, she moved to Paris by herself to pursue a career in [[Osteopathy]], but found herself moving around a lot, without knowing anybody in the area. Shortly after, her father passed away at age 46. Due to the incident, she describes realizing that life is too short and that her true ambition was acting. After graduation, she went straight to [[drama school]]. She is fluent in [[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and in 2011 she also learned to speak [[English language|English]].<ref name=IGN>{{cite web|last=Singer|first=Leigh|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/116/1168491p1.html|title=Pirates of the Caribbean: Astrid Berges-Frisbey Interview|publisher=IGN|date=17 May 2011|accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref>
