'''Vera Miles''' (born August 23, 1929) is an American actress who worked closely with [[Alfred Hitchcock]], most notably as [[Lila Crane]] in the classic masterpiece ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', reprising the role in the 1983 sequel, ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. Her other popular films include ''[[The Wrong Man]]'', ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', ''[[Follow Me Boys!]]'' and ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]''.

==Early life==
Miles was born '''Vera June Ralston''' in 1929 in [[Boise City, Oklahoma]] to Thomas and Burnice ([[married and maiden names|née]] Wyrick) Ralston. She had three elder siblings.<ref name="filmr">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587256/ Vera Miles profile at FilmReference.com]</ref><ref>[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800017695/bio Vera Miles Biography at Yahoo! Movies]</ref> She grew up first in [[Pratt, Kansas]], and later lived in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], where she worked nights as a [[Western Union]] operator-typist and graduated from [[Wichita North High School]] in 1947. She was crowned [[Miss Kansas]] in 1948 and was the third runner-up in the [[Miss America]] contest.<ref>[http://pageantcenter.com/pageant%20results/Miss_America_Pageant/miss_america_pageant_results-1948.html Results at pageantcenter.com]</ref><ref>See [[Miss America 1948#Placements]]</ref> When she appeared as a contestant on the April 4, 1951, edition of the [[Groucho Marx]] [[quiz show]] ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' described as "a beauty contest winner", Marx asked her about some of the titles she held. She replied, "I was first Miss Chamber of Commerce and then Miss Wichita and then Miss Kansas and Miss Texas Grapefruit and recently I've been chosen Miss New Maid Margarine and I had the honor to represent Kansas in the Miss America pageant." {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Career==
Miles moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1950, and landed small roles in films and television, including a minor role as a chorus girl in ''[[Two Tickets to Broadway]]'' (1951), a musical starring [[Janet Leigh]], with whom Miles co-starred nine years later in the classic [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. Miles eventually was put under contract at various studios. She once recalled, "I was dropped by the best studios in town."<ref name="imdb"/>

While under contract to [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], Miles was cast in ''[[Tarzan's Hidden Jungle]]'' (released in 1955) as [[Tarzan]]'s love interest. During filming she married her ''Tarzan'' co-star, [[Gordon Scott]]; they divorced in 1959. Director [[John Ford]] chose  Miles to star as [[Jeffrey Hunter]]'s love interest in ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956) starring [[John Wayne]]. That same year, she co-starred in ''[[23 Paces to Baker Street]]'' with [[Van Johnson]]. In 1957, she began a five-year personal contract with [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and was widely publicized as the director's potential successor to [[Grace Kelly]].<ref>Charlotte Chandler, ''It's Only A Movie: Alfred Hitchcock, a Personal Biography'', Simon & Schuster, 2005, p. 237; ISBN 0-7432-4508-3</ref>

Miles' new mentor directed her in the role of [[Ralph Meeker]]'s emotionally troubled new  bride in "Revenge", the pilot episode of his television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. Suitably impressed, Hitchcock directed her on the big screen alongside [[Henry Fonda]], who played a musician falsely accused of a crime, in ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1956). ''[[New York Times]]'' film critic [[Bosley Crowther]] singled out Miles' performance, writing that she "does convey a poignantly pitiful sense of fear of the appalling situation into which they have been cast". Hitchcock undertook to reinvent his new star through grooming and wardrobe supervised by [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning costume designer [[Edith Head]]. {{cn|date=September 2014}}

Production delays and her pregnancy cost Miles the leading role opposite [[James Stewart]] in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), the project Hitchcock designed as a showcase for his  new star (the role which eventually went to [[Kim Novak]]). When asked several years later about Miles by director [[François Truffaut]] for the book ''Hitchcock/Truffaut'', Hitchcock explained their professional falling-out this way: "She became pregnant just before the part that was going to turn her into a star. After that, I lost interest. I couldn't get the rhythm going with her again." Miles reflected, "Over the span of years, he's had one type of woman in his films, [[Ingrid Bergman]], Grace Kelly and so on. Before that, it was [[Madeleine Carroll]]. I'm not their type and never have been. I tried to please him, but I couldn't. They are all sexy women, but mine is an entirely different approach". {{cn|date=September 2014}}

Despite their differences, Hitchcock cast Miles in what is arguably the role for which she is most remembered, that of [[Lila Crane]] in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. She was cast in 1962 and 1965 episodes of ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]''. In 1962 she worked with [[John Ford]] again on ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' starring [[John Wayne]] and [[James Stewart]] as two men competing for her hand in marriage (Stewart wins). Miles was featured in many popular television shows. On February 26, 1960, she starred in the episode "Mirror Image" of the classic [[CBS]] [[television series]], ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' with [[Martin Milner]]. Miles guest starred on the [[Darren McGavin]] [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]''.<ref name="imdb"/>

On October 4, 1960, Miles appeared in the episode "Three Rode West" of NBC's ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'' western series in the role of Annie Andrews, a young woman who is seeking a husband and ends up being terrorized by outlaw Frank Skinner, played by [[Myron Healey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0624815|title=''Laramie'': "Three Rode West", October 4, 1960|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=September 29, 2012}}</ref>

In 1963, she co-starred in the first episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' titled "Fear in a Desert City". In 1964 she co-starred in an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', "Forms of Things Unknown" (broadcast May 4, 1964), along with [[David McCallum]], Sir [[Cedric Hardwicke]], [[Scott Marlowe]] and [[Barbara Rush]].<ref name="imdb"/> 

In 1965 Miles portrayed Sister Gervaise in the episode, "There's a Penguin in My Garden", of ''[[Mr. Novak]]'', a series starring [[James Franciscus]] as an idealistic Los Angeles high school teacher. She also played a supporting role in several episodes of the CBS television series ''[[My Three Sons]]'', starring [[Fred MacMurray]]. In 1966 Miles co-starred with  MacMurray in the [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Follow Me, Boys!]]''. In 1968 she starred opposite former co-star [[John Wayne]] in ''[[Hellfighters (film)|Hellfighters]]''; scenes where she had played John Wayne's character's wife in ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' were cut by Warner Bros. who wanted more action in the film.<ref>{{Citation|last=Munn|first=Michael|title=John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth|year=2004|location=London, UK|publisher=Robson Publishing|pages=294–295|isbn=1-86105-722-9}}</ref> She played a cosmetics queen who commits murder in "Lovely but Lethal", a 1973 episode of NBC's ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]''. She made an appearance in an episode called the "Adventure of the Two-faced Woman" on the short-lived crime mystery series [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072496/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_37 ''Ellery Queen'']. In 1983, two decades after she appeared in ''Psycho'', Miles reprised the role of Lila Crane for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. Throughout the 1980s until her retirement in 1995, Miles continued to work in both television and film.<ref name="imdb"/>

==Personal life==
Miles has been married three times. Her first husband was [[Bob Miles]]. They were married from 1948 until 1954, and had two daughters, Debra and Kelley. Her second husband was [[Gordon Scott]]. They were married from 1954 until 1959, and had one son, Michael. Her third husband was actor [[Keith Larsen]]. They were married from 1960 until 1971, and had one son, Erik.<ref name="imdb">{{IMDb name|0587256}}</ref>

Miles currently resides in [[California]], refusing to grant interviews or make public appearances. Her grandson, actor Jordan Essoe, however, met with actress [[Jessica Biel]] in 2012 in preparation for Biel's portrayal of Miles in the film ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]''.<ref>[http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/5-things-learned-about-sacha-gervasis-hitchcock-starring-anthony-hopkins-helen-mirren-scarlett-johansson-20121121 Vera Miles' grandson Jordan Essoe met with Jessica Biel to discuss the film ''Hitchcock'']; accessed September 24, 2014.</ref>
