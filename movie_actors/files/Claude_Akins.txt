Akins was featured in three episodes of the original CBS series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' (''i.e.'', "[[The Little People (The Twilight Zone)|The Little People]]", "[[The Thirty-Fathom Grave]]" and "[[The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street]]").

Akins' other early appearances included a role as a policeman on [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]] in "Place of Shadows" (1956) and "Reward to Finder" (1957). Akins played another television cop, good-natured Sheriff's Detective Phillip Dix, in the first season of the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' in "The Case of the Half-Wakened Wife" ([[List of Perry Mason episodes|Episode 1-26]]) that aired March 15, 1958. He was in a first season episode of ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' titled "Burial Ground of the Gods" (1958) that starred Jack Kelly. In 1965 Akins played El Supremo in "The Man from U.N.C.L.E." episode, The Very Important Zombie Affair. In 1967 Akins played Lt. Finch in ''[[The Lucy Show]]'' episode, "Lucy Meets the Law," as he interrogates Lucy as a grand larceny suspect.  Lucy is eventually cleared of the crime when the actual redhead confesses to it.

Akins was cast as Lou Myerson in the 1964 episode, "One Monday Afternoon", of the NBC education drama series, ''[[Mr. Novak]]'', starring [[James Franciscus]] and as Dr. Roy Kirk in an episode of the CBS  Political Drama, Slattery's people, (Which starred Richard Crenna.) "When Do they Hang The Good Samaritan?" Dr. Kirk's sister Lucrezia was plated by Barbara Eden.  In 1965, he was featured in an episode of Kraft Suspense Theater, playing a German infiltrator who went unsuspected (despite Akins' Native American ancestry.)

Before his signature character Sheriff Lobo, Akins appeared as owner-operator trucker Sonny Pruitt in NBC's ''[[Movin' On (TV series)|Movin' On]]'', from 1974 to 1976 with [[Frank Converse]]. Akins starred in over 40 episodes of Movin'On plus a made for TV movie "In Tandem." He also starred, as a Nashville Police detective named Stoney Huff and also starring Jerry Reed and Charlie Pride, in a short-lived hour-long crime drama (cancelled after four episodes) in April, 1977 called ''[[Nashville 99 (TV series)|Nashville 99]]''. Akins' best-known role of Sheriff Elroy P. Lobo had begun as a recurring character on the TV show B.J. and the Bear. Sheriff Lobo constantly harassed and tried to jail BJ for anything he could think of due to his hatred for him. This was due to B.J.'s constant interruptions and meddling which always ruined Lobo's plans and schemes. Lobo's popularity ended up garnering him his own show with the pilot episode actually airing on BJ and the Bear in the episode entitled "Lobo." He also played the owner of a small airstrip in the short-lived 1984 series ''[[The Master (TV series)|The Master]]'' (episode title "Max") with [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Demi Moore]]. On 7 October 1984 (in "Deadly Lady," the second episode of "Murder, She Wrote," starring Angela Lansbury), Akins was introduced as Jessica Fletcher's fisherman friend Ethan Cragg, a recurring character who (unlike Tom Bosley's Sheriff Amos Tupper, introduced in the same episode) never reappeared after the popular show's first season. After becoming a recognizable name in the late 1970s, Akins did [[testimonial]] TV commercials for PoliGrip, Rollins Truck Leasing and [[AAMCO Transmissions]]. ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' was his last TV role in 1991, where he played a kidnapper and was killed by Lonnie Jamison and Bubba Skinner.

Akins found work in the late 1980s lending his inimitable voice talents to the work safety instructional video series, ''Safety Shorts'', in which he expounded the virtues of workplace safety to thousands of industrial employees, offering lessons on the importance of lockout/tagout procedures, personal protective equipment, and the [[Material safety data sheet|MSDS]] documentation process. Akins also made a golfing video with [[Ron Masak]] titled, ''Tom Kite and Friends''.

==Death==
Akins died of [[cancer]] in [[Altadena, California]], on January 27, 1994.

==Legacy==
The Claude Akins Memorial Golf Classic, a 6-person scramble-format golf tournament, takes place at Otis Park Golf Course in Bedford, Indiana, in August or September of each year.  Proceeds from the event go to the Akins Scholarship and the Bedford Recreation Foundation Scholarship, given every year to a graduating senior at Bedford North Lawrence High School, as well as many projects involving recreation and improvements. Such projects have included Special Olympics, playground equipment, the junior golf program, Boys and Girls Clubs and city parks.
