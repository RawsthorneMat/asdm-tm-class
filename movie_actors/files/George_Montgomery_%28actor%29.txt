==Background==
Montgomery was born '''George Montgomery Letz''', the youngest of fifteen children of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] immigrant parents, in [[Brady, Montana|Brady]], in [[Pondera County, Montana|Pondera County]], northern [[Montana]].<ref name=montgomery2>{{cite web|title=125 Montana Newsmakers: George Montgomery |url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers5/montgomery.html|work=Great Falls Tribune|author=Tribune Staff|accessdate=August 27, 2011}}</ref> He was reared on a large ranch where as a part of daily life he learned to ride horses and work cattle. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Letz studied at the [[University of Montana]] in [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]] for a year.

==Acting career==
Montgomery was more interested in a career in [[motion pictures|film]] than in a college education. Therefore, he left Montana for [[Hollywood]]. Two days after his arrival there, he was working as a stunt man on a [[Greta Garbo]] film at [[MGM]].<ref name=Matinee>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-02/entertainment/ca-19504_1_george-montgomery|title=George Montgomery Visits His Fans : A Folksy Matinee For Old-time Actor|author=Wong, Herman|date=2 April 1985|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=21 March 2012}}</ref> At [[Republic Pictures]], his cowboy skills got him stunt work and a small acting part at the age of eighteen in a 1935 film, ''[[The Singing Vagabond]]''.

He followed this with bit parts and additional stunt work as George Letz in mostly low-budget films. He was frequently cast in western films starring their number one [[box office]] draw, the singing cowboy, [[Gene Autry]]. Elevated to more important secondary roles, in 1938 he appeared as one of the six men suspected of being the titular hero in ''[[The Lone Ranger#Film serials|The Lone Ranger]]''. That year ''Life'' included him in a photo montage of "Hollywood's Movie-struck Kids" and described Montgomery, still using his full name, as "6 ft. 3 in. tall, weighs 210 lb., rides well, is superlatively handsome."<ref name="life1938060634">{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LU8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA2&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=These are Hollywood's Movie-struck Kids | work=Life | date=1938-06-06 | accessdate=December 8, 2011 | pages=34}}</ref> He remained with Republic Pictures until 1940 when he signed with [[20th Century Fox]], which billed him as George Montgomery.

At Fox, Montgomery appeared in more westerns including ''[[The Cisco Kid and the Lady]]'' (1940) with [[Cesar Romero]]. In 1942, he played opposite [[Gene Tierney]] in ''[[China Girl (1942 film)|China Girl]]'', [[jazz]] musician [[Glenn Miller]] in ''[[Orchestra Wives]]'', and [[Ginger Rogers]] in ''[[Roxie Hart (film)|Roxie Hart]]''. The following year, Montgomery starred with [[Betty Grable]] in the [[Walter Lang]]-directed film, ''[[Coney Island (1943 film)|Coney Island]]''.

[[World War II]] interrupted his film career. He played the lead in ''[[Bomber's Moon]]'', released in August 1943, joined the [[United States Army Air Forces]] the same year.

In 1950, he starred as the title role in ''Davy Crockett, Indian Scout'' and was one of the actors considered for the role of Crockett by Walt Disney.

In the early 1950s he made several films for [[Edward Small]] and also for Columbia Pictures.<ref>DINAH and GEORGE A BUSY, HAPPY COUPLE: She Stars on Television, He in the Movies, but Their Successful Careers Have Not Wrecked Their 10-Year Marriage, a Fate Usual in Hollywood, Hopper, Hedda. Chicago Daily Tribune (1923–1963) [Chicago, Ill] 27 Dec 1953: c10.</ref>

In the 1958–59 season, Montgomery starred in his own 26-episode [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, ''[[Cimarron City (TV series)|Cimarron City]]'' as Mayor Matt Rockford, with co-stars [[John Smith (actor)|John Smith]] and [[Audrey Totter]] through his own production company Mont Productions. . Montgomery claimed to have turned down the lead roles in the Western television series ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Wagon Train''<ref>Montgomery, George ''The Years of George Montgomery'' Sagebrush; 1st edition (1981)</ref>

Montgomery produced and directed as well as starred in several films shot in the Philippines and South Africa. He planned to make a [[Vietnam War]] film ''The Ho Chi Minh'' trail in Bangkok and the Philippines but the film was aborted.<ref>p.390 Parish, James Robert &  DeCarl, Lennard '' George Montgomery'' in ''Hollywood Players: The Forties'' Arlington House Publishers, 1976</ref>

Through the early 1970s, Montgomery acted in films such as ''[[Satan's Harvest]]'' (1970) and ''The Daredevil'' (1972) and made guest appearances on a number of television shows, including NBC's ''[[Bonanza]]'' and ''[[The Gisele MacKenzie Show]]''.

==Family life==
On December 5, 1943, Montgomery married singer [[Dinah Shore]]. They had one child, Melissa Ann "Missy" Montgomery (born 1948), during a marriage that lasted until 1963. George and Dinah also adopted John "Jody" David Montgomery in 1954. In 1963, Montgomery's private life made headlines when his housekeeper was charged in a failed attempt to kill him. Allegedly suffering from a fanatical attraction to her employer, the deranged woman planned to shoot Montgomery, then [[suicide|take her own life]].<ref>Breznican, Anthony  ''Western Star George Montgomery Dies'' Associated Press December 13, 2000</ref>

==Other interests==
As a boy, George Montgomery had developed excellent craftsmanship with wood and as an adult pastime he began building furniture, first for himself and then for a few friends. His skill was such that his hobby became a full-fledged cabinet-making business in which he employed as many as twenty craftsmen.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Montgomery oversaw the furniture business for more than forty years and expanded his interest to house design. He became involved with the building of eleven homes for friends and family. His artistic instincts included learning how to sculpt in [[bronze]]. Self-taught, he sculpted upwards of fifty bronze sculptures including ones of [[John Wayne]], [[Clint Eastwood]], Gene Autry, [[Randolph Scott]], and future President [[Ronald W. Reagan]].<ref name="Matinee"/> His sculpture of his former wife, Dinah Shore, and their children is at the Mission Hills Country Club in [[Rancho Mirage, California]], home to the [[LPGA]] [[Kraft Nabisco Championship]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

After a career that included more than eighty feature films, Montgomery retired in 1972, making only two more minor appearances in film until his death at his home in [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]], [[California]], aged 84.

After [[cremation]], Montgomery's ashes were divided and interred at [[Forest Lawn Cemetery (Cathedral City)]] near his [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] home<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brooks|first1=Patricia|title=Laid to Rest in California: a guide to the cemeteries and grave sites of the rich and famous |chapter=Chapter 8: East L.A. and the Desert |page=245 |year=2006|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|location=Guilford, CT|isbn=978-0762741014|last2=Brooks |first2=Jonathan |oclc= 70284362}}</ref><ref>{{Find a Grave|7477970|George Montgomery}}</ref> and at the Highland Cemetery in [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]], Montana, near his birthplace.<ref>{{Find a Grave|6261001|George Montgomery}}</ref><!-- Each Find a Grave link has photos of niche/statue. -->
