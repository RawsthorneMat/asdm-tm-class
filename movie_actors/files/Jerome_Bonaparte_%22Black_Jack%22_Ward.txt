'''Jerome Bonaparte "Black Jack" Ward''' was an American cowboy and Western actor who appeared in over 160 films from 1927 to 1946.

==Professional career==
Ward was born in [[Franklin, Louisiana]] on May 3, 1891, but found his way to Hollywood during the height of the making of the black and white westerns appearing in over 160 such films as mostly an uncredited bit and background actor.  He was credited in ''The Ghost Rider'' (1935) as Henchman Chalky,  ''[[Texas Stampede]]'' (1939) as Ave Avery, ''[[Rainbow Riders]]'' (1934) as Texarkana Pete aka The Candy Kid and in ''[[Lightning Bill]]'' (1934) as Ranch hand Red.

Ward was a work horse appearing in 42 films during the years of 1931 and 1932 alone during the most grueling era of [[The Great Depression]] when people turned to the entertainment world of film as a diversion from that dark and uncertain time in America history.

==Real life shoot out==
In February 1940 Ward became involved in a real life shooting on Sunset Boulevard near Columbia Studios when he shot and killed fellow bit and background actor [[John Tyke]] after an altercation in which Ward claimed that Tyke had been threatening him for months.  When Tyke threatened him with a gun Ward pulled his gun and fired, killing Tyke.

On July 18, 1940, the Los Angeles District Attorney found that Ward had fired in self-defense and dismissed the charges.  Although it had no known bearing on the shoot out between Ward and Tyke, it was later learned that Tyke had been a suspect in a gas station robbery in the area.  The police had intention of questioning Tyke in the matter but did not get the chance.

== Death ==
Ward died in Los Angeles, California on April 29, 1954.
