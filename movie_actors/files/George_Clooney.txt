Clooney began appearing in films while working on ''ER''. His first major Hollywood role was in the horror comedy-crime thriller ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'', directed by [[Robert Rodriguez]] and co-starring [[Harvey Keitel]]. He followed its success with the romantic comedy ''[[One Fine Day (film)|One Fine Day]]'' with [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], and the action-thriller ''[[The Peacemaker (1997 film)|The Peacemaker]]'' with [[Nicole Kidman]]. Clooney was then cast as [[Batman]] in [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', which was a modest box office performer, but a critical failure (with Clooney himself calling the film "a waste of money"). In 1998, he co-starred in the crime-comedy ''[[Out of Sight]]'' opposite [[Jennifer Lopez]], marking the first of his many collaborations with director [[Steven Soderbergh]]. He also starred in ''[[Three Kings (1999 film)|Three Kings]]'' during the last weeks of his contract with ''ER''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

After leaving ''ER'', Clooney starred in the commercially successful films ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'' (2000), a disaster drama, and ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' (2000), a [[Coen brothers]]' adventure comedy. In 2001, he teamed up with Soderbergh again for the heist comedy ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'', a [[remake]] of the 1960s [[Rat Pack]] film [[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|of the same name]]. As of 2011, it was Clooney's most successful film, earning more than $450&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/?pagenum=2&p=.htm|title=All Time Worldwide Box Office Grosses|publisher=|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}</ref> The film spawned two sequels starring Clooney, ''[[Ocean's Twelve]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Ocean's Thirteen]]'' in 2007.

In 2001, Clooney and Soderbergh co-founded [[Section Eight Productions]], for which [[Grant Heslov]] was president of television. Clooney made his directorial debut in the 2002 film ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'', based on the autobiography of TV producer [[Chuck Barris]]. Though the film did not do well at the box office, critics stated that Clooney's directing showed promise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jackasscritics.com/movie.php?movie_key=275 |title=Jackass Critics – Confessions of a Dangerous Mind |publisher=Jack Ass Critics |accessdate=June 17, 2012}}</ref>

In 2005, Clooney starred in ''[[Syriana]]'', which was based loosely on former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] agent [[Robert Baer]]'s memoirs of his service in the Middle East. He suffered an accident on the set of ''Syriana'', which caused a brain injury with complications from a punctured [[dura mater|dura]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/clooney%20contemplated%20suicide%20over%20brain%20injury |title=George Clooney – Clooney Contemplated Suicide Over Brain Injury |publisher=Contact Music |accessdate=September 19, 2009}}</ref> The same year he directed, produced, and starred in ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'', a film about 1950s television journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]]'s famous war of words with Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. At the 2006 Academy Awards, Clooney was nominated for [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for ''Good Night, and Good Luck'', as well as [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for ''Syriana''. He won the Oscar for his role in ''Syriana''.

Clooney next appeared in ''[[The Good German]]'' (2006), a [[film noir]] directed by Soderbergh that is set in post-World War II Germany. In August 2006, Clooney and Heslov started the production company [[Smokehouse Pictures]]. In October 2006, Clooney received the [[American Cinematheque Award]], which honors someone in the entertainment industry who has made "a significant contribution to the art of motion pictures".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americancinematheque.com/ball/2006/2006georgeclooney.htm|title=The Presentation of the 21st Annual American Cinematheque Award.|publisher=|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}</ref> On January 22, 2008, Clooney was nominated for an Academy Award (and many other awards) for Best Actor for ''[[Michael Clayton (film)|Michael Clayton]]'' (2007). Later that year, he directed his third film, ''[[Leatherheads]]'', in which he also starred. On April 4, 2008, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Clooney had quietly resigned from the [[Writers Guild of America]] over a dispute concerning ''[[Leatherheads]]''. Clooney, who is the director, producer, and star of the film, claimed that he had contributed in writing "all but two scenes" of it, and requested a writing credit alongside Duncan Brantley and [[Rick Reilly]], who had worked on the screenplay for 17 years. Clooney lost an arbitration vote 2–1, and withdrew from the union over the decision. He became a "[[financial core]] status" non-member, meaning he no longer has voting rights, and cannot run for office or attend membership meetings, according to the WGA's constitution.<ref name="reuters1">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0239381220080404 |title=George Clooney in feud with writers union, |agency=Reuters |date=February 9, 2009 |accessdate=September 19, 2009}}</ref>
