He has an older brother, Phillip, and two younger half brothers, Paul and Michael. Peter took the name Brown from his stepfather, Albert Brown.

During his [[United States Army]] service in [[Alaska]] with the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)]], Brown became involved in writing, directing and acting in plays to entertain the other troops.  Upon his discharge, Brown studied Drama at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] and soon was appearing in plays and on ''NBC Matinee Theatre''.  Brown also supported himself by working in a [[gasoline station]] on the [[Sunset Strip]].  One night a man paid for his purchase with a credit card reading "[[Jack L. Warner]]".  Brown asked the customer whether he was one of the Warner Brothers, the man replied "I'm the last one left".<ref>[http://www.peterbrown.tv/bio.html Peter Brown Biography<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The next day Brown was offered a screen test at the studio.

==Career==
As a contract player for Warner Brothers, Brown appeared in the films ''[[Red Nightmare]]'' and ''[[Darby's Rangers (1958 film)|Darby's Rangers]]''.  Though his role in ''[[Onionhead]]'' was cut from the completed film, the producer Julius Schermer hired him for Deputy Johnny McKay in ''Lawman'', an important part that lasted from 1958 to 1962. Brown is the only surviving member of the series.  Brown also appeared in the 1962 film, ''[[Merrill's Marauders (film)|Merrill's Marauders]]''.

Brown appeared on dozens of other television shows and did several [[fictional crossover|crossovers]] with other western series as Johnny McKay, including ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', in the 1961 episode "Hadley's Hunters," featuring [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] as Bart Maverick, along with a host of characters from other Warner Brothers. westerns, including ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' ([[Clint Walker]]), ''[[Bronco (TV series)|Bronco]]'' ([[Ty Hardin]]), and ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' ([[Will Hutchins]]). In the ''Cheyenne'' episode "Renegades" (1958), Brown at twenty-two was cast as 17-year-old Jed Wayne, who enlists in the [[United States Army]] after his father is killed in an attack by [[Comanche people|Comanche]] renegades. Olive Sturgess played Kathy Donovan, who takes an interest in young Wayne and is the daughter of the fort commander, [[Colonel]] Ralph Donovan (Bartlett Robinson), who distrusts the Indians. The episode also focuses on the spirit and endurance of Wayne's mortally lame horse and the wisdom of the Comanche chief, Little Elk ([[Steve Darrell]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0540138/|title=Renegades: ''Cheyenne''|date=February 11, 1958|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=September 2, 2014}}</ref>

Brown twice guest-starred in another ABC/WB western, ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]'', with [[Wayde Preston]]. He appeared as Dave with [[Andrew Duggan]] and [[Bob Steele (actor)|Bob Steele]], who were cast as Jim Rexford and Sergeant Granger respectively in "The Peacemaker" or "Judgment Day", the series premiere in 1957. Thereafter that same season, he was cast as Jimmy Benedict opposite [[Charles Bronson]] as the outlaw Danny Arnold in the episode "Young Gun".

After his contract with Warner Brothers lapsed, Brown made two films for [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]]. He appeared in other television series too, such as ''[[Redigo (TV series)|Redigo]]'', starring [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] as a [[New Mexico]] rancher.

Brown began the 1970s in [[exploitation films]] such as ''[[Foxy Brown (film)|Foxy Brown]]'', ''Chrome and Hot Leather'', and ''Rape Squad'' and many soap operas. On ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', he played Dr. Greg Peters from 1972-1979 who was involved in a romance with Amanda Howard ([[Mary Frann]]).  He was Laurie Brooks' attorney, Robert Laurence on ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' (1981-1982) when she was on trial for the murder of her former mother-in-law, Vanessa Prentiss. After the storyline ended, he romanced Laurie's sister, Leslie Brooks, but that ended when his wife Claire came out of a long comatose state. He would return briefly to "Y&R" in between soap stints in the late 1980s. Peter replaced [[John Shearin]] as Roger Forbes on ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'' during its early days, but was written out after only a couple of months. From 1986-1987, he played Charles Sanders, former ambassador to Mendora on ''[[One Life to Live]]'' whose family briefly dominated the front-burner of the soap. His character memorably had a heart attack and died on the evening of his wedding to Lee Halpern.
