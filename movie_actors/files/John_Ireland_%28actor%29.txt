'''John Benjamin Ireland''' (January 30, 1914 &ndash; March 21, 1992) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] actor and film director.

==Early life==
Ireland was born '''John Benjamin Ireland''' in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] on January 30, 1914.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/john-ireland/ | title=John Ireland | publisher=[[LA Times]] | accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/499/000043370/ | title=John Ireland | publisher=[[NNDB]] | accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> He lived in [[New York City]] from a very early age. Ireland's formal education ended at the 7th grade and like many children he worked to help his family make ends meet. He never knew his father. His mother remarried and had three other children, a daughter Kathryn, a son named Tommy (became Tommy Noonan who co-starred in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"), and another son Michael. Their last name was Noone. Ireland never knew for sure where his last name came from. One of his jobs was in a water carnival where he wrestled a dead octopus. His discovery of acting was by accident but he fell in love with it and studied Shakespeare as his "formal" education. Tall and lean, he appeared on Broadway and toured in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s before entering film in the mid-1940s.<ref name=Lambert>[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/23/arts/john-ireland-78-longtime-actor-with-role-in-all-the-king-s-men.html "John Ireland, 78, Longtime Actor With Role in 'All the King's Men'"] Bruce Lambert, THE NEW YORK TIMES, March 22, 1992</ref>

==Career==
Ireland made his screen-debut as Private Windy, the thoughtful letter-writing GI, in the 1945 war film ''[[A Walk in the Sun (1945 film)|A Walk in the Sun]]''. This was followed by ''[[Wake Up and Dream (film)|Wake Up and Dream]]'' in 1946. A supporting actor in several notable Westerns including [[John Ford]]'s ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946) and [[Howard Hawks]]' 1948 film ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (the scene between Ireland and [[Montgomery Clift]], where they compare guns and take each other's measure by "walking" a can across the ground with their revolver shots, is a film classic). Having a lead in small noirs like ''[[Railroaded!]]'' (1947), Ireland was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] as [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his forceful performance as Jack Burden, the hard-boiled newspaper reporter who evolves from devotee to cynical denouncer of demagogue Willie Stark ([[Broderick Crawford]]) in ''[[All the King's Men (1949 film)|All the King's Men]]'' (1949), making him the first Vancouver-born actor to receive an Academy Award nomination.

During [[McCarthyism]] in the early 50s, he successfully sued two television producers for [[breach of contract]] and [[slander]], claiming that they reneged on roles promised to him due to his perceived political undesirability. He received an undisclosed but "substantial" cash settlement.<ref name=Lambert/>

A prolific performer in films and early television, Ireland had made the transition to supporting roles by the mid-1950s, playing cynical villains in films like ''[[Vengeance Valley]]'' (1951), ''[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]'' (1957). He had a large supporting part in ''[[55 Days at Peking]]'' (1963) under [[Charlton Heston]]. He also starred as an innocent man-on-the-run in the 1955 original ''[[The Fast and the Furious (1955 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' and had a key role as the gladiator Crixus in the [[Stanley Kubrick]] 1960 spectacle ''[[Spartacus]]'', co-starring with [[Kirk Douglas]].

In 1959, Ireland appeared as Chris Slade, with [[Karl Swenson]] as Ansel Torgin, in the episode "The Fight Back" of the [[NBC]] western series, ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]''. In the storyline, Tom Fowler ([[Tom Laughlin]]), the boss of the corrupt river town of Hampton near [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Mississippi]], blocks farmers from shipping their crops to market. In a dispute over a wedding held on the ''Enterprise'', a lynch-mob led by Fowler comes after series lead-character Grey Holden ([[Darren McGavin]]). [[Karl Swenson]] also was cast in this episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0687109/|title="The Fight Back", ''Riverboat'', October 18, 1959|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref>

In 1960, Ireland starred as Winch in the [[CBS]] western series, ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' episode "Incident of the Garden of Eden". 
In 1962, he portrayed the character Frank Trask in the episode "Incident of the Portrait" on CBS's ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''.

From 1960&ndash;1962, he starred in the British television series ''[[The Cheaters (TV series)|The Cheaters]]'', playing John Hunter, a claims investigator for an insurance company who tracked down cases of fraud. By the mid-1960s, he was seen as the star of [[B-movies]] such as ''[[I Saw What You Did]]'', In 1965, he played role of Jed Colby, a trail scout in ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' on American television. This was the last season for ''Rawhide''.

In 1967, he appeared on ''[[Bonanza]]'' with [[Michael Landon]] in the episode "Judgement at Red Creek". A few years later he again appeared with Landon on ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' as a drunk who saves Carrie Ingalls, who had fallen down an abandoned mine shaft.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/little-house-on-the-prairie/little-girl-lost/episode/63932/summary.html?tag=ep_guide;summary ''Little House on the Prairie'' episode profile]</ref> 
 
Ireland was seen in Italian productions like ''The House of the Seven Corpses'' (1974), ''[[Salon Kitty (film)|Salon Kitty]]'' (1976) and ''Satan's Cheerleaders'' (1977). He did, however, also appear in big-budget fare such as ''[[The Adventurers (1970 film)|The Adventurers]]'' (1970), also as a police lieutenant in the [[Robert Mitchum]] private-eye story ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]'' (1975). He was seen in the ''[[War of the Worlds (TV series)|War of the Worlds]]'' episode "Eye for an Eye" in 1988.

Ireland regularly returned to the stage throughout his career and co-directed two features in the 1950s: the acclaimed Western drama ''Hannah Lee'' (1953) and the carjacking B-movie ''[[The Fast and the Furious (1955 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' (1955).

==Personal life==
Occasionally Ireland's name was mentioned in tabloids of the times, in connection with much younger starlets, namely [[Natalie Wood]], [[Barbara Payton]], and [[Sue Lyon]]. He attracted controversy by dating 16-year-old actress [[Tuesday Weld]] when he was 45. Ireland also had an affair with co-star Joan Crawford while on the set of ''[[Queen Bee (film)|Queen Bee]]'' (1955). A decade later, Ireland and Crawford would co-star again in William Castle's horror flick ''[[I Saw What You Did]]''.

He was married three times; first from 1940â€“1949, to Elaine Sheldon, by whom he had two sons named John and Peter. Then, from 1949-1957, to [[Joanne Dru]]. Finally, from 1962 until his death, to Daphne Myrick Cameron, with whom he had a daughter named Daphne and a son named Cameron.<ref name=Lambert/>

In his later years, he owned a restaurant, ''Ireland's'', in [[Santa Barbara, California]].

==Death==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}

On March 21, 1992, Ireland died in [[Santa Barbara, California]] of [[leukemia]] at the age of 78.<ref name=Lambert/> He is buried at the Santa Barbara Cemetery.
