===''X-Men'' films===
{{Main|X-Men (film series)}}
Marsden was cast as [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]]. His character is prominent in the comics; his screen time in the films, however, is increasingly reduced, particularly in the sequels. Notably, Marsden also appeared in [[Bryan Singer]]'s ''[[Superman Returns]]''. Singer dropped out of the [[X-Men: The Last Stand|third installment]] to direct ''Superman'' and Marsden was cast as [[Lois Lane]]'s fiancé, Richard White, but due to schedule conflicts, Marsden's screen time in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' was reduced, stirring controversy from fans of the comics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/supermanreturns?q=Superman%20Returns|title=Superman Returns (2006): Reviews|date=June 28, 2006|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=November 14, 2008}}</ref> Marsden's portrayal of Cyclops in the films was well received and garnered him a [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster Award]] for Best Supporting Actor.<ref>{{cite news | title = Actor Cast As Scott Summers In Wolverine!? | work = X-Men Films.net | date = May 6, 2008 | url = http://xmenfilms.net/blog/2008/05/06/actor-cast-as-scott-summers-in-wolverine/ | accessdate=May 7, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080510121917/http://xmenfilms.net/blog/2008/05/06/actor-cast-as-scott-summers-in-wolverine/ |archivedate = May 10, 2008}}</ref>

In 2014, after his character had died in the ''The Last Stand'', Marsden reprised his role of Cyclops in a brief cameo for ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past (film)|X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', as did a few of the original actors from the first film including [[Anna Paquin]] and [[Famke Janssen]]. He has expressed interest in returning for future films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/JoshWildingNewsAndReviews/news/?a=91411|publisher=Comic Book Movie|title=James Marsden Expresses Desire To Return As 'Cyclops' In X-MEN: APOCALYPSE|author=Josh Wilding|date=December 11, 2013|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}</ref>
