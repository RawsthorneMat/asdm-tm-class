'''Harold Allen Ramis''' (November 21, 1944 – February 24, 2014) was an American actor, director, and writer specializing in comedy. His best-known film acting roles are as [[Egon Spengler]] in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984) and Russell Ziskey in ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' (1981); he also co-wrote both films. As a writer-director, his films include the [[comedy|comedies]] ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980), ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' (1983), ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' (1993) and ''[[Analyze This]]'' (1999).  Ramis was the original head writer of the television series ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'', on which he also performed, and one of three screenwriters of the film ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' (1978).

Ramis' films have influenced subsequent generations of comedians and comedy writers.<ref name="newyorker"/> Filmmakers including [[Jay Roach]], [[Jake Kasdan]], [[Adam Sandler]], and [[Farrelly brothers|Peter and Bobby Farrelly]] have cited his films as among their favorites.<ref name="newyorker"/> He won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for ''Groundhog Day''.

Afterward, Ramis worked in a mental institution in St. Louis for seven months. He later said of his time working there that it
{{quote|text=...prepared me well for when I went out to [[Hollywood]] to work with [[actor]]s. People laugh when I say that, but it was actually very good training. And not just with actors; it was good training for just living in the world. It's knowing how to deal with people who might be reacting in a way that's connected to anxiety or grief or fear or rage. As a [[film director|director]], you’re dealing with that constantly with actors. But if I were a businessman, I’d probably be applying those same principles to that line of work.<ref name=sacks />}}

==Career==

===Early years===
Ramis began writing [[parody|parodic]] plays in college, saying years later, "In my heart, I felt I was a combination of [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]] and [[Harpo Marx]], of Groucho using his wit as a weapon against the upper classes, and of Harpo’s antic charm and the fact that he was oddly sexy — he grabs women, pulls their skirts off, and gets away with it".<ref name="newyorker" /> He avoided the [[Vietnam War]] [[military draft]] by taking [[methamphetamine]] to fail his draft physical.<ref name="GQcs">{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Brett |date=July 2009 |title=Harold Ramis Gets the Last Laugh |journal=[[GQ]] |volume= |issue= |pages=64–67, 124–25 |id= |url=http://men.style.com/gq/features/full?id=content_9558&pageNum=5 |accessdate=August 15, 2009 |quote=}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Following his work in St. Louis, Ramis returned to Chicago, where by 1968, he was a substitute teacher at schools serving the inner-city [[Robert Taylor Homes]].<ref>Caldwell, Sara C., and Marie-Eve S. Kielson, ''So You Want to be A Screenwriter: How to Face the Fears and Take the Risks'' (Allworth Press, 2000), p. 75. ISBN 1-58115-062-8, ISBN 978-1-58115-062-9</ref> He also became associated with the [[guerrilla television]] collective [[TVTV (video collective)|TVTV]], headed by his college friend [[Michael Shamberg]], and wrote freelance for the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]''. "Michael Shamberg right out of college had started freelancing for newspapers and got on as a stringer for a local paper, and I thought, 'Well, if Michael can do that, I can do that'. I wrote a spec piece and submitted it to the ''Chicago Daily News'', the Arts & Leisure section, and they started giving me assignments [for] entertainment features."<ref name=fji>[[Frank Lovece|Lovece, Frank]], [http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/esearch/e3idff59d66183db8680e5f9b5f083fa8ab?pn=1 "Ramis's realm: Comedy creator surveys career from Second City to 'Year One'"], ''[[Film Journal International]]'' online, June 12, 2009</ref> Additionally, Ramis had begun studying and performing with Chicago's [[The Second City|Second City]] [[improvisational comedy]] troupe.<ref>[[Sheldon Patinkin|Patinkin, Sheldon]]. ''The Second City: Backstage at the World's Greatest Comedy Theater'' (Sourcebooks MediaFusion, 2000) ISBN 1-57071-561-0, ISBN 978-1-57071-561-7.{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref>

Ramis' newspaper writing led to his becoming joke editor at [[Playboy|''Playboy'' magazine]].<ref name=sacks/> "I called ... just cold and said I had written several pieces freelance and did they have any openings. And they happened to have their entry-level job, party jokes editor, open. He liked my stuff and he gave me a stack of jokes that readers had sent in and asked me to rewrite them. I had been in Second City in the workshops already and Michael Shamberg and I had written comedy shows in college".<ref name="fji"/> Ramis was eventually promoted to associate editor.<ref name="NYT obit">{{cite news|author=Martin, Douglas|date=February 24, 2014|title=Harold Ramis, 69, Dies; Alchemist of the Hilarious|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/25/movies/harold-ramis-who-helped-redefine-what-makes-us-laugh-on-screen-dies-at-69.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}</ref>

===National Lampoon and ''SCTV''===
After leaving Second City for a time and returning in 1972, having been replaced in the main cast by [[John Belushi]], Ramis worked his way back as Belushi's deadpan foil. In 1974, Belushi brought Ramis and other Second City performers, including Ramis's frequent future collaborator [[Bill Murray]], to [[New York City]] to work on  ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]''.<ref name="newyorker" />

During this time, Ramis, Belushi, Murray, [[Joe Flaherty]], [[Christopher Guest]], and [[Gilda Radner]] starred in the revue ''The National Lampoon Show'', the successor to ''[[National Lampoon's Lemmings]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Karp |first=Josh |title=A Futile and Stupid Gesture: How Doug Kenney and National Lampoon Changed Comedy Forever |location= |publisher=Chicago Review Press |year=2006 |page=219 |isbn=1-55652-602-4 |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> Later, Ramis became a performer on, and head writer of, the late-night sketch-comedy television series ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' during its first three years (1976–1979).<ref>Caldwell, Kielson, p. 77</ref> He was soon offered work as a writer at ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' but chose to continue with ''SCTV''.<ref name="NYT obit" /> Characterizations by Ramis on ''SCTV'' include corrupt ''[[Dialing for Dollars]]'' host/SCTV station manager Maurice "Moe" Green, amiable cop Officer Friendly, exercise guru Swami Bananananda, board chairman Allan "Crazy Legs" Hirschman and home dentist Mort Finkel. His celebrity impressions on ''SCTV'' included [[Kenneth Clark]] and [[Leonard Nimoy]].

===Film career===
Ramis left ''SCTV'' to pursue a film career and wrote a script with ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' magazine's [[Douglas Kenney]] which would eventually become ''[[Animal House|National Lampoon's Animal House]]''. They were later joined by a third collaborator, [[Chris Miller (writer)|Chris Miller]].  The 1978 film followed the struggle between a rowdy [[college fraternity]] house and the [[Dean (education)|college dean]]. The film's humor was raunchy for its time. ''Animal House'' "broke all box-office records for comedies" and earned $141 million.<ref name="newyorker" />

Ramis next co-wrote the comedy ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'', starring [[Bill Murray]]. The movie was a commercial success and became the first of six film collaborations between Murray and Ramis.<ref name="newyorker" /> His third film and his directorial debut was ''[[Caddyshack]]'', which he wrote with Kenney and [[Brian Doyle-Murray]].  It starred [[Chevy Chase]], [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Ted Knight]], and Bill Murray. Like Ramis's previous two films, ''Caddyshack'' was also a commercial success.

In 1982, Ramis was attached to direct the film adaptation of the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'' by [[John Kennedy Toole]].  The film was to star [[John Belushi]] and [[Richard Pryor]], but the project was aborted.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070610110538/http://www.premiere.com/features/3861/20-movies-not-coming-soon-to-a-theater-near-you-page4.html Saito, Stephen  "20 Movies Not Coming Soon to a Theater Near You"], Section: "A Confederacy of Dunces", ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'', no date</ref> In 1984, Ramis collaborated with [[Dan Aykroyd]] on the screenplay for ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', which became one of the biggest comedy hits of the summer, in which he also starred as Dr. Egon Spengler,<ref>{{cite web|title='Ghostbusters 3' in Theaters by Christmas 2012!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/20170/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting}}</ref> a role he reprised for the 1989 sequel, ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' (which he also co-wrote with Aykroyd). His later film ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' has been called his "masterpiece".<ref name="newyorker">{{cite news | last=Friend | first=Tad | authorlink=Tad Friend | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/04/19/040419fa_fact3?currentPage=all| title= Comedy First: How Harold Ramis’s movies have stayed funny for twenty-five years | work=[[The New Yorker]] | date= April 19, 2004|accessdate=August 28, 2007}}</ref>

His films have been noted for attacking "the smugness of institutional life ... with an impish good [will] that is unmistakably American". They are also noted for "Ramis's signature tongue-in-cheek pep talks”. Sloppiness and improv are also important aspects of his work. Ramis frequently depicts the qualities of "anger, curiosity, laziness, and woolly idealism" in "a hyper-articulate voice".<ref name="newyorker"/>

Ramis also occasionally acted in supporting roles in acclaimed films that he did not write or direct such as [[James L. Brooks]]' [[Academy Award]]-winning ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'' (1997) and [[Judd Apatow]]'s hit comedy ''[[Knocked Up]]'' (2007).

In 2004, Ramis turned down the opportunity to direct the [[Bernie Mac]]-[[Ashton Kutcher]] film ''[[Guess Who (film)|Guess Who]]'', then under the working title "The Dinner Party", because he considered it poorly written.  That same year, he began filming the low-budget ''[[The Ice Harvest]]'', "his first attempt to make a comic film noir".  Ramis spent six weeks trying to get the film [[Greenlight|greenlit]] because he had difficulty reaching an agreement about stars [[John Cusack]]'s and [[Billy Bob Thornton]]'s salaries. The film received mixed reviews. As of 2004, Ramis's typical directing fee was $5 million.<ref name="newyorker" />

In an interview in the documentary ''American Storytellers'', Ramis said he hoped to make a film about [[Emma Goldman]] (even pitching Disney with the idea of having Bette Midler star)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalstar.com/articles/2004/04/14/sunday_am/10048008.txt |title=An 'exceedingly dangerous woman':Emma Goldman's story | first=  L.

Ramis said in 2009 he planned to make a third ''Ghostbusters'' film for release either in mid-2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heebmagazine.com/blog/view/2471 | title = Ramis on 'Ghostbusters 3': 'Plans to Shoot Next Summer and Release in 2011' | first=Brian |last=Abrams | work = [[Heeb]] | date= December 28, 2009 | accessdate = February 24, 2014}}</ref> or for Christmas 2012.<ref>Ramis interview, [[WABC-TV]], via {{cite web|url= http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18543 | title = Harold Ramis Says 'Ghostbusters 3' in 2011! | publisher=BloodyDisgustng.com | date= December 30, 2009 | accessdate= 2014-02-24}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Ramis was married twice and was the father of three children. On July 2, 1967,<ref name=filmref /> he married [[San Francisco]] artist Anne Plotkin, with whom he had a daughter, Violet.<ref name="newyorker" /> Actor and ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' co-star [[Bill Murray]] is Violet's godfather.<ref name="newyorker"/> Ramis and Plotkin separated in 1984 and later divorced.<ref name="newyorker" /> In 1989 Ramis married Erica Mann, daughter of director [[Daniel Mann]] and actress Mary Kathleen Williams.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/23/theater/daniel-mann-79-the-director-of-successful-plays-and-films.html |title=Daniel Mann, 79, the Director Of Successful Plays and Films |date=November 23, 1991 |newspaper=The New York Times |first=William H. |last=Honan}}</ref> Together they had two sons, Julian Arthur and Daniel Hayes.<ref name=filmref /> Although Ramis maintained non-supernatural [[Humanism|Humanist]] beliefs, Erica's [[Buddhist]] upbringing was to be a huge influence on his philosophies for the rest of his life, and he became friends with the [[Dalai Lama]].

Ramis was a [[Chicago Cubs]] fan and attended games every year to conduct the [[seventh-inning stretch]] at [[Wrigley Field]].{{When|date=February 2014}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/golf-devil-ball-golf/remembering-harold-ramis-caddyshack-183328382--golf.html | publisher = [[Yahoo!]] | date = 24 February 2014 | accessdate= 24 February 2014 | title  = Remembering Harold Ramis and "Caddyshack" | first = Shane | last = Bacon}}</ref> His pastimes included [[fencing]], ritual [[drum]]ming, acoustic guitar, and making hats from felted fleece; he taught himself skiing by watching skiers on television.<ref name="newyorker" />

In May 2010, Ramis contracted an infection that resulted in complications from [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune]] inflammatory [[vasculitis]] and lost the ability to walk. After relearning to walk he suffered a relapse of the disease in late 2011.<ref name=chicagotribuneobit/>

He died of complications of the disease on February 24, 2014 at his home on Chicago's [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]], at age 69.<ref name=chicagotribuneobit>{{cite news|title=Harold Ramis, Chicago actor, writer and director, dead at 69|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-harold-ramis-dead-20140224,0,4983189,full.story | first=Mark |last=Caro|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref>

On the event of death, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] released a statement on Ramis, saying "when we watched his movies – from ''Animal House'' and ''Caddyshack'' to ''Ghostbusters'' and ''Groundhog Day'' – we didn’t just laugh until it hurt.  We questioned authority.  We identified with the outsider.  We rooted for the underdog.  And through it all, we never lost our faith in happy endings." <ref>http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/02/25/statement-president-passing-harold-ramis</ref> He ended his statement by saying he hoped Ramis "received total consciousness," in reference to a line from ''Caddyshack''.<ref>http://www.thewrap.com/president-obama-makes-caddyshack-joke-tribute-harold-ramis/</ref>
