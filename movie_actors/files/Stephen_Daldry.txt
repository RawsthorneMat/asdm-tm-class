After this, Daldry joined a youth theatre group in Taunton,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2002/dec/08/features.review | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Kate | last=Kellaway | title=Stephen Daldry: He'll turn his hand to anything | date=8 December 2002}}</ref> and also [http://www.tauntonthespians.org.uk/archive/plays/h/Hay_Fever_78.html performed as Sandy Tyrell in Hayfever for local amateur society Taunton Thespians] and then aged 18 won a [[Royal Air Force]] scholarship to [[University of Sheffield]] to study English, where he became chairman of SuTCo (Sheffield University Theatre Company).

After graduation, he spent a year travelling through [[Italy]], where he became a [[clown]]'s apprentice. Returning to Sheffield, he became an apprentice at the [[Crucible Theatre]] from 1985–1988. He then trained as an actor at [[East 15 Acting School]], London.

==Career==
Daldry began his career at the [[Sheffield Crucible]] with Artistic Director [[Clare Venables]] where he directed many productions. He also headed many productions at the Manchester Library Theatre, [[Liverpool Playhouse]], Stratford East, Oxford Stage, Brighton and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. He was also Artistic Director of the [[Royal Court Theatre]] from 1992–98, where he headed the £26 million development scheme. He was also Artistic Director of London's [[Gate Theatre (London)|Gate Theatre]] (1989–92) and the Metro Theatre Company (1984–86). He is currently on the Board of the Young and Old Vic Theatres and remains an Associate Director of the Royal Court Theatre. He was the [[Cameron Mackintosh]] Visiting Professor of Contemporary Theatre for 2002 at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]]. He won awards on Broadway as well as the West End.

Daldry made his feature film directorial debut in 2000 with ''[[Billy Elliot]]''. His next film was ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'', and it won Best Actress at the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Nicole Kidman]].

According to Chabon, production then stalled due to "studio-politics kinds of reasons that I'm not privy to," and as of April 2007 remains inactive.<ref name=deet>{{cite news |author=Timothy Hodler |title=Michael Chabon Q & A |url=http://men.style.com/details/features/landing?id=content_5477 |work=Details |year=2007 |accessdate=29 May 2008}}</ref>
