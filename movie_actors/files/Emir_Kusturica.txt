==Cinematic career==
In 1978, after graduating from the [[Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague|film school]] (FAMU) at the [[Academy of Performing Arts in Prague|Academy of Performing Arts]] in Prague, Kusturica began directing made-for-TV [[short film]]s in Yugoslavia.

Kusturica wrote the screenplays for both ''Do You Remember Dolly Bell?'' and ''When Father Was Away on Business''. In 1989 Kusturica earned more accolades for ''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'', a film about [[Romani people|Romani]] culture and the exploitation of their youth. In 1989 he was a member of the jury at the [[16th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name="Moscow1989">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |title=16th Moscow International Film Festival (1989) |accessdate=2013-02-24 |work=MIFF}}</ref>

===1990s===
Kusturica continued to make highly regarded films into the next decade, including his American debut, the absurdist comedy ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' (1993). He won the [[Palme d'Or]] for his black comedy epic, ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'' (1995), based upon a scenario of [[Dušan Kovačević]], a noted Serbian playwright.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kustu.com/w2/en:biography|title=Kusturica biography|publisher=Kustu.com |accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> He also taught Film Directing at Columbia University's Graduate Film Division.

In 1998, he won the Venice Film Festival's Silver Lion for Best Direction for ''[[Black Cat, White Cat]]'', a farcical comedy set in a Gypsy ([[Romani people|Romany]]) settlement on the banks of the [[Danube]]. The music for the film was composed by the Belgrade-based band [[No Smoking Orchestra]].

===2000s===
In 2001, Kusturica directed ''[[Super 8 Stories]]'', a documentary road and concert movie about [[Zabranjeno Pušenje#The No Smoking Orchestra (Belgrade)|The No Smoking Orchestra]], of which he is a band member.

On 8 September 2007, Kusturica was appointed a [[UNICEF]] National Ambassador for Serbia, alongside [[Ana Ivanovic]], [[Jelena Janković]] and [[Aleksandar Đorđević]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Since January 2008 he has organized the annual private [[Küstendorf Film Festival]]. Its first installment was held at [[Drvengrad]], a village built for his film ''[[Life Is a Miracle]]'', from 14 to 21 January 2008.<ref>{{Wayback |date=20080214194548 |url=http://www.pressonline.co.yu/vest4.jsp?id=25799&sectionId=42 |title=Emir Kusturica i Voja Brajović najavili su prvi filmski festival "Kustendorf" u Drvengradu na Mokroj Gori}}, PRESS, 14 December 2007</ref> His next film, ''Cool Water'', is a comedy set against the background of a [[Middle East conflict]]. Filming started in November 2010 in Germany. It is the first time Emir Kusturica directed a film which he did not write.

===2010s===
During the promotion of his autobiography in 2010, Kusturica was asked why he thinks his cinematic style translates well in the [[Western World|West]] when so many Eastern European, Yugoslav or Serbian authors never managed to do the same: {{cquote|My oeuvre was born while moving around from Sarajevo to Prague via Belgrade, at the exact spot where communism started to disintegrate. While at the same time in parallel a mythical projection of that downfall was being created with stuff like [[Pope John Paul II|Karol Wojtyła]] being elected to be the new Pope to steer things down that road. And I entered that corridor like [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] entered the revolution and I came out through a door where my movies that feature love-filled depictions of some of these things happened to find a receptive audience. I underscore love here because I was never anti-communist. Quite the contrary, some of my deepest personal convictions were shaped and molded in that system though I obviously don't put much from that system into practice when it comes to my own life. So I sort of entered into that mythical projection of the tear-down of communism with my first two feature films, which communicated through poetic narrative, but without a trace of hate, unlike say [[Yugoslav Black Wave]] that actually disqualified communism in every way possible. I on the other hand, out of affection for my father who was a staunch communist and my family that fought in [[World War II]] on the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisan]] side, extended that love into those movies as well. And the West took to it because the West isn't one big monolithic entity. I realize that to many ordinary people in Serbia, the West is [[Olli Rehn]] or some other similar fat and balding EU bureaucrat, but fortunately there's more to it. Another thing is this. When I submitted ''[[When Father Was Away on Business]]'' to the Cannes Film Festival back in 1985 it was one of 700 films the selectors had to sift through and choose some dozen or so for the competition program. When I did the same with ''Underground'' a decade later it was one of 1,200 films. Nowadays, we're talking 2,500 to 3,000 films every year submitted at Cannes. So in that gargantuan quantity, your quality really has to shine through. And for me quality was fierce authenticity. So to recap, why do I think the West is receptive to me? First and foremost, I got in at a good moment during the tear-down of communism or more specifically the tear-down of [[Bolshevism]]. And secondly, no less importantly, they respond to my genuine commitment to the basic authentic motifs that have been existing here in the Balkans for centuries.<ref>{{YouTube|JUu4G4AQ9pM}}</ref>}}

At the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival|64th Cannes Film Festival]], held 11–22 May 2011, Kusturica presided over the jury of the ''[[Un Certain Regard]]'' section of the festival's official selection. On 14 May, in [[Cannes]], he was invested with the insignia of Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]], the highest [[Order (honour)|decoration]] in [[France]].<ref>"[http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/58442.html Emir Kusturica named Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur]".

During the festival Kusturica also performed for the residents and guests of Saint Petersburg with his band "The No Smoking Orchestra"

During the last months of 2013, Kusturica started shooting a [[documentary film]] on the life of the Uruguayan president [[José Mujica]], whom he considers "the last hero of politics".<ref name="docukusturica">{{cite web |url=http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/275329/documental-de-kusturica-tiene--sus-primeras-imagenes-locales-/ |title=Local images of Kusturica's documentary |date=2 April 2014 |publisher=El Observador (Uruguay)|language=es}}</ref>

===Acting===
After numerous film cameo appearances over the years, Kusturica's first sizable acting role took place in ''[[The Widow of St. Pierre]]'', a 2000 movie by director [[Patrice Leconte]], where he played a convict on the French island colony of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint Pierre]].

==Musical career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2014}}
[[File:Emir Kusturica1.jpg|thumb|upright|Performing with [[Zabranjeno Pušenje#The No Smoking Orchestra (Belgrade)|The No Smoking Orchestra]] in March 2009.]]
In mid-1986, Kusturica, already an accomplished film director at the time, started playing [[bass guitar]] in [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], a Sarajevan punk rock outfit that was the main driving force behind the [[New Primitivism]] movement. In addition to being on friendly terms with the guys and admiring their work, Kusturica's inclusion in the group had to do with the difficult situation Zabranjeno Pušenje found itself in following the political and media scandal caused by the verbal offence committed by their frontman [[Nele Karajlić]]. The so-called 'Marshal affair' that played out throughout late 1984 and early 1985 severely limited the band's access to media, causing its second album to sell poorly; additionally, three of the six members left the group in light of its bleak commercial prospects. Therefore, in 1986 as the band was still reeling from the scandal and devising strategy for the future, the thinking behind Kusturica's arrival on board was that having the famous and celebrated film director affiliated with Zabranjeno Pušenje will help it get over the media bans it faced. Kusturica played bass on three track on the band's third studio album ''[[Pozdrav iz zemlje Safari]]'' and also contributed by composing the music for the track "Probušeni dolar" on the same album. Furthermore, he directed the video for the track "Manijak", which was deemed controversial, receiving a television ban due to vague visual allusions to the [[Agrokomerc Affair]],
{{Citation needed|reason=The song of the video is sang from the point of a rapist, singing a love letter to his future victim. Any vague allusions to Agrokomerc would be from the scene in which the rapist leaves a box of cookies on a park bench, which are noticed by a girl who bends over to pick them up. At which point the rapist jumps from behind the bush, grabs her from behind by the hips, presses his pelvis to her behind and thrusts it forward. Cut to girls face acting surprised and amazed. Cut to her hand crumpling the box of cookies. So please, do provide the source that the video was banned for displaying a box of cookies, and not for displaying RAPE AS ENJOYABLE. I'd really like to read that source.|date=August 2014}} yet another political scandal brewing in Bosnia at the time. Still, with hit songs like "Balada o Pišonji i Žugi", "Hadžija il bos", and "Dan Republike", the band managed to regain its popularity and commercial success. Though never fully involved in the band's day-to-day life, Kusturica left Zabranjeno Pušenje in 1988.

Kusturica returned to the group following the ''[[Black Cat, White Cat]]'' film and the band's name changed to '''Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra'''. In 1999, the No Smoking Orchestra recorded a new album, ''Unza Unza Time'', produced by the Universal record company, as well as a music video, directed by Emir Kusturica. The band has been touring internationally since 1999. The musician and composer [[Goran Bregović]] has composed music for three of Kusturica's films: ''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'', ''[[Arizona Dream]]'', which featured [[Iggy Pop]]; and ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]''.

===''Time of the Gypsies'' punk opera===
During 2007, Kusturica and Nele Karajlić prepared a punk opera, ''Time of the Gypsies''. The initial idea came five years earlier in 2002 from Kusturica's collaborator [[:fr:Marc di Domenico|Marc di Domenico]] while the support of the [[Paris Opera]] director [[Gérard Mortier]] got the project rolling. Basing the production on his eponymous 1988 film, Kusturica wrote the [[libretto]] by adapting the story of the Gypsy youth from the Balkans relocating to Italy in order to obtain money for his ill sister's surgery. The director cast young Serbian folk singers Stevan Anđelković and Milica Todorović in the roles of Perhan and Azra, respectively, while the experienced Karajlić took the role of Ahmed Đida. The music in the original movie had been composed by [[Goran Bregović]]; however, since Kusturica and he have not been on speaking terms since the late 1990s, those songs couldn't be used.<ref name="bloomberg-2007">[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aksivviuScus Kusturica's 'Time of the Gypsies' Gets Opera Staging in Paris];Bloomberg, 27 June 2007</ref> The all-new score was composed by Dejan Sparavalo of The No Smoking Orchestra.

Despite the aforementioned conflict of religion, Kusturica refused to see himself as either a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] or [[Serbs|Serb]].

==Controversy==

===Work===
Kusturica and his work have provoked controversy at home and abroad.<ref name="experiencefestival.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Emir_Kusturica_-_Controversy/id/5020343|title=Emir Kusturica controversy, Encyclopedia II|publisher=Experiencefestival.com|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'', scripted by Dušan Kovačević, was partly financed by state-owned [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] television. It recounted the history of Yugoslavia from World War II until the conflict in the 1990s. Some {{Who|date=December 2011}} Bosnian and French critics claimed the film contained pro-Serb propaganda.<ref name="guardian">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/may/15/film.cannes20041 Serb director tries for third triumph], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2004</ref><ref name="nytimes">[http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/05/movies/dispute-leads-bosnian-to-quit-films.html Dispute Leads Bosnian to Quit Films], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 5 December 1995</ref>

French philosopher and writer [[Alain Finkielkraut]], a supporter of the Croatian nationalist leader [[Franjo Tuđman]],<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=KZf7iYGxTfIC&lpg=PA120&ots=Q7FhIC_Mfc&dq=finkielkraut%20tudjman&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q=finkielkraut%20tudjman&f=false</ref> denounced the Cannes Film Festival's jury award, saying:<blockquote>In recognizing "Underground", the Cannes jury thought it was honouring a creator with a thriving imagination. In fact, it has honoured a servile and flashy illustrator of criminal clichés. The Cannes jury&nbsp;... praised a version of the most hackneyed and deceitful Serb propaganda. The devil himself could not have conceived so cruel an outrage against Bosnia, nor such a grotesque epilogue to Western incompetence and frivolity.<ref name="nytimes"/></blockquote> It was later revealed that Finkielkraut had not seen the film before writing his criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kustu.com/w2/en:polemics|title=The polemic 'Underground'|publisher=Kustu.com |accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/faut-il-bruler-underground_610275.html|title=Faut-il brûler Underground?|work=L'Express|location=France|date=19 October 1995|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IDktuer8qcAC&lpg=PA42&ots=aRXRSjyxtH&dq=finkielkraut%20underground&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q=finkielkraut%20underground&f=false|title=Notes from the underground: the&nbsp;... – Google Books|publisher=Google Books|date=2 June 1995|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> 
French philosopher [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]] made a film criticizing ''Underground''.<ref name="guardian"/> In a discussion with Levy, the Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] said:<blockquote>I hope we share another point, which is – to be brutal – hatred of [director] Emir Kusturica. ''Underground'' is one of the most horrible films that I've seen. What kind of Yugoslav society do you see in Kusturica's ''Underground''?

[[Sarajevo]]-born novelist [[Aleksandar Hemon]], who emigrated to the United States before the war, said ''Underground'' downplayed [[Serbia in the Yugoslav Wars|Serbian atrocities]] by presenting "the Balkan war as a product of collective, innate, savage madness."<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/magazine/08EMIR.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=The (Mis)Directions of Emir Kusturica|first=Dan|last=Halpern|date=8 May 2005|accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref>

===Libel cases===

====Andrej Nikolaidis====
[[Andrej Nikolaidis]], a [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] writer and columnist, criticized Kusturica for appearing to agree with [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s propaganda during the [[Bosnian War]].

In May 2004, Nikolaidis wrote in the ''[[Monitor (magazine)|Monitor]]'' magazine:
<blockquote>Considering he proclaimed his dead father a Serb, and himself, Emir, an Orthodox Christian, he easily chose his own in the Bosnian War. He recognized them in Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić. He wasn't there to fire cannon barrages, but whenever he could, with his artistic and media get-up he provided them an alibi for every killed Muslim who didn't want to admit that he was originally an "Orthodox Christian".{{Cite quote|date=November 2011}}</blockquote>

Kusturica sued Nikolaidis and the ''Monitor'' newspaper for civil damages at the Supreme Court of Montenegro. In the end, Nikolaidis was ordered to pay $6,490 to Kusturica for calling the famed director a "media star of Milosevic's war machinery".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=VA&p_theme=va&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1066699784919DBF&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Victoria Advocate|publisher=Newsbank|accessdate=2 April 2010|date=17 November 2004}}</ref> The judge ruled that the evidence was not credible enough.<ref name="The case of Kusturica">[http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/ita/aree/Montenegro/Il-caso-Kusturica Il caso Kusturica], 23 February 2005 (in Italian)</ref> In the end Nikolaidis and the paper were fined 12,000 euros for breaking the code of journalism by calling Kusturica "stupid, ugly and corrupt" in the article.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/hronika.php?id=110061 |title=Blic Online &#124; Vrhovni sud Crne Gore presudio u korist Kusturice|publisher=Blic.rs|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>

===2010 Antalya festival===
In October 2010 Kusturica withdrew from the jury of [[47th Antalya "Golden Orange" International Film Festival|Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival]] after being publicly criticized and accused by Turkish director [[Semih Kaplanoğlu]] and Turkey's minister of culture [[Ertuğrul Günay]] over his alleged remarks and opinions about the [[Bosnian War]].<ref name=abc>[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=11843737 "Kusturica Quits Film Festival Jury in Turkey"], ABC News, Retrieved on 11 October 2010.</ref>

The criticism of Kusturica was started by an organization called the Turkish-Bosnian Cultural Federation as soon as Kusturica was announced as a jury member.<ref>[http://www.blic.rs/Kultura/Vesti/208018/Kritike-Kusturice-u-Turskoj Kritike Kusturice u Turskoj];''Blic'', 20 September 2010</ref> Turkish media reported that Kusturica repeatedly downplayed the number of killed people and the rape of Muslim women during the war.<ref name=abc/> It was not clear when Kusturica was supposed to have made those comments, but the daily ''[[Milliyet]]'' said Kusturica denied the allegations.<ref name=abc/>

Public sentiment in Turkey and in Serbia were such that a couple of days after Kusturica left Turkey, there were news reports by Serbian [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]] claiming that a mob of Turkish youths in [[Antalya]] physically assaulting Swiss actor Michael Neuenschwander (in town to promote his movie ''180° – Wenn deine Welt plötzlich Kopf steht'') because they mistook him for Kusturica due to apparent physical resemblance between the two.<ref>[http://www.blic.rs/Zabava/Vesti/212171/Kusta-Dobro-je-da-sam-otisao-iz-Turske Prebijen glumac koji liči na slavnog reditelja – Kusta: Dobro je da sam otišao iz Turske]; ''Blic'', 16 October 2010</ref> Later, Neuenschwander's press agent said there was no physical assault and that Neuenschwander was verbally abused by a small group.<ref>[http://www.haberturk.com/yasam/haber/561959-saldiriya-ugramadi-sozlu-tepki-gordu Saldırıya uğramadı, sözlü tepki gördü]; ''Haberturk'', 16 October 2010{{tr icon}}</ref>

Kusturica later commented on the incident: {{cquote|I did receive a sincere apology from the mayor of Antalya [[Mustafa Akaydın]] over what happened. Essentially, I became collateral damage in the ongoing political fight between the central powers from the ruling coalition in Istanbul and the municipal authorities in Antalya where the local power is held by a [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|social-democrat party]]. But regardless of everything, this is completely unacceptable on a basic level – when you're an invited guest somewhere, your hosts simply cannot behave in this manner. And this run-in I had was with a part of Turkish society, the part that consists of highly-evolved primitives. I am not a politician and I'm not obliged to comment on and dissect every crime or genocide around the world. And then I got very angry and I told them if they're so sensitive about genocide it would be much better for them to publicly condemn the [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]] they committed against the [[Armenians|Armenian people]], before having a go at me with accusatory statements. I clearly condemned the crimes in Bosnia, but the 'problem' is that I condemned the crimes committed by all sides, which makes me incompatible with the strategy they have for Bosnia.<ref>{{YouTube|65hCPfBNcH4}}</ref>}}
