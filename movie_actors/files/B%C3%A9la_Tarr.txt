'''Béla Tarr''' (born July 21, 1955) is an acclaimed Hungarian [[film director]]. Much of his work is marked by [[philosophical]] elements and a [[pessimistic]] view of humanity. His films utilize unconventional storytelling methods, such as long takes and/or non-professional actors to achieve [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. 

Debuting with his film ''[[Family Nest]]'' in 1979, Tarr underwent a period of what he refers to as "social cinema", aimed at telling mundane stories about ordinary people, often in the style of [[cinema vérité]]. Over the next decade, the cinematography of Tarr's films  gradually changed; ''[[Damnation (film)|Damnation]]'' (1988) was shot with languid camera movement aimed at establishing ambience. It marked Tarr's earliest experimentation with philosophical themes, focused mostly on bleak and desolate representations of reality. ''[[Sátántangó]]'' (1994) and ''[[Werckmeister Harmonies]]'' (2000) continued this approach; both are considered by some critics to be among the [[Greatest film of all time|greatest films ever made]]. Tarr would later compete in the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]] with his film ''[[The Man from London|The Man From London]]''. 

Frequent collaborators of Tarr include his wife Ágnes Hranitzky, novelist [[László Krasznahorkai]], film composer [[Mihály Víg]], [[cinematographer]] [[Fred Kelemen]], and actress Erika Bók. After the release of his film ''[[The Turin Horse]]'' (2011), Tarr announced his definitive retirement from film direction. He has been teaching at the Sarajevo Film School since.

==Life==
Tarr was born in [[Pécs]], but grew up in [[Budapest]].<ref name="Bingham2011">{{cite book

|pages=206–}}</ref> His parents were both in the theatre and film industry: his father designed scenery, while his mother worked as a prompter at a theatre for more than 50 years. At the age of 10, Tarr was taken to a casting session run by Hungarian National Television (MTV) by his mother, and he ultimately won the role of the protagonist's son in a TV drama adaptation of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''. Other than a small role in [[Miklós Jancsó]]'s film ''Szörnyek évadja'' (''Season of Monsters'', 1986) and few one-glimpse cameos (such as in [[Gábor Bódy]]'s ''Dog's Night Song'' [1983]), Tarr has sought no other acting roles. By his own account, initially he sought to become a philosopher, and considered film-making as something of a hobby. However, after making his 8mm short films, the Hungarian government would not allow Tarr to attend university so he instead chose to pursue film production.

==Early work==
Tarr began to realize his interest in filmmaking at the age of 16 by making amateur films and later working as a caretaker at a national House for Culture and Recreation.<ref name=ankeny/> Most of his amateur works were documentaries, mostly about the life of workers or poor people in urban Hungary. His amateur work brought him to the attention of the [[Béla Balázs Studios]] (named in honor of the Hungarian cinema theorist, [[Béla Balázs]]), which helped fund Tarr's 1977 feature debut ''Családi tűzfészek'' (''Family Nest''), which Tarr began making at the age of 22.<ref name=ankeny/> Tarr shot the film without any budget and with non-professional actors (participating in the film only in "friendship" and without any salary) and on original locations in six days. The film was faithful to the "[[Budapest school]]" or "documentarist" style popular at the time within Béla Balázs Studios, maintaining absolute [[social realism]] on screen. Critics found the film to suggest the influence of the American director [[John Cassavetes]],<ref name=ankeny/><ref name=wilmington/> though Tarr denied having seen any of Cassavetes's films prior to shooting ''Családi tűzfészek''. The film was eventually released in 1979.

After completing "Családi tűzfészek," Tarr began his studies in the Hungarian School of Theatrical and Cinematic Arts. The 1980 film ''Szabadgyalog'' (''The Outsider'') and the following year's ''Panelkapcsolat'' (''The Prefab People'') continued in much the same vein, with small changes in style. The latter was the first film by Tarr to feature professional actors in the leading roles. With a 1982 television adaptation of ''[[Macbeth]]'', his work began to change dramatically.  The film is composed of only two shots:  the first shot (before the main title) is five minutes long, the second 67 minutes long.<ref name=ankeny/> In his later films, Tarr's visual sensibility moves from a preference for raw close-ups to more abstract medium and long shots, while his philosophical sensibility shifts from grim realism to a more metaphysical outlook that is in some ways similar to that of [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]. However, Tarr himself considers [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] and not Tarkovsky as his main influence.

==Later work==
After 1984's ''Őszi almanach'' (''Almanac of Fall''), Tarr (who had written his first four features alone) began collaborating with Hungarian novelist [[László Krasznahorkai]] for 1988's ''[[Kárhozat]]'' (''Damnation''). A planned adaptation of Krasznahorkai's epic novel ''[[Sátántangó]]'' took over seven years to realize; the 415-minute film was finally released to international acclaim in 1994.<ref name=ankeny/> After this epic he released the 35-minute ''Journey on the Plain'' in 1995, but fell into silence until 2000's ''[[Werckmeister Harmóniák]]'' (''Werckmeister Harmonies''), occasionally shot under very intense circumstances.{{fix|text=such as?}} It was acclaimed by critics and the Festival circuit in general.

Many, if not most, of the shots in these later films are around six to eleven minutes long. It is possible that for some, a month was spent on a single shot. In many of these shots the camera swoops, glides, pans, and/or cranes. Often it circles the characters, and sometimes even spans multiple scenes. A shot may, as in the opening of ''Sátántangó'', travel with a herd of cows around a village, or follow the nocturnal peregrinations of a drunkard who is forced to leave his house because he's run out of alcohol. [[Susan Sontag]] has championed Tarr as one of the saviors of the modern cinema, saying she would gladly watch ''Sátántangó'' once a year.

After ''Werckmeister Harmonies'' he began filming ''[[A Londoni férfi]]'' (''The Man From London'') an adaptation of a [[Georges Simenon]] novel. It was scheduled to be released at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] in May, but production was postponed because of the February suicide of producer [[Humbert Balsan]]. Additionally, there were disputes with other producers regarding a possible change in the film's financing.<ref name=variety/> It premiered at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name=cannes007/> and was released worldwide in 2008. Tarr then began working on a film called ''[[A torinói ló]]'' (''The Turin Horse'') which he has said will be his last.

For many years, none of his work was available on DVD (except in Japan), but ''Werckmeister Harmonies'' and ''Damnation'' have been made available on a two-disc DVD in Europe, courtesy of [[Artificial Eye]] (who have also issued ''The Man From London'') and both films are now available in [[North America]] on separate DVDs from Facets Video. Tarr's early works; ''Family Nest'', ''The Outsider'', and ''The Prefab People'' are also available on DVD in the USA, courtesy of Facets. Facets was supposed to release ''Sátántangó'' on DVD on November 28, 2006, but was delayed until July 22, 2008. Artificial Eye released the film on November 14, 2006. A comparison of the two DVD editions has been posted at DVD Beaver.<ref name=beaver/>

In September 2012, he received the BIAFF special award for lifetime achievement<ref>{{cite web|title=FESTIVALS: BIAFF Grand Prix award goes to In Darkness|url=http://www.filmneweurope.com/news/georgia/103798-festivals-biaff-grand-prix-award-goes-to-in-darkness/menu-id-154}}</ref>

==Cine Foundation International==
In January 2011, Tarr joined the Board of Directors of the recently formed cinema foundation and [[NGO]] for human rights [[Cine Foundation International]]. In a press release dated January 24, 2011 Tarr made the following statement regarding the imprisonment of filmmakers [[Jafar Panahi]] and [[Mohammad Rasoulof]]:
:Cinematography is an integral part of universal human culture! An attack against cinematography is desecrating universal human culture! This cannot be justified by any notion, ideology or religious conviction! Our friend, brother and esteemed colleague Jafar Panahi is in prison today, based on conjured and fictional accusations! Jafar did not do anything else than what is the duty of all of us; to talk honestly, fairly about our own country and loved ones, to show everything that surrounds us with tender tolerance and harsh austerity! Jafar’s real crime is that he did just that; gracefully, elegantly and with a roguish smile in his eyes! Jafar made us love his heroes, the people of Iran; he achieved that they have become members of our families! WE CANNOT LOSE HIM! This is our common responsibility, as despite all appearances we belong together.<ref name=garage/><ref name=cinefo/>

==Influence==
[[Gus Van Sant]] often cites Tarr as a huge influence on his later work,<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Jenny|title=Gus Van Sant in the light of Béla Tarr|url=http://blogs.walkerart.org/filmvideo/2008/03/17/gus-van-sant-light-bela-tarr/|work=blogs.walkerart.org|accessdate=21 February 2011|date=March 17, 2008|quote=I have been influenced by Béla Tarr’s films and after reviewing the last three works Damnation, Satantango, and Werckmeister Harmonies, I find myself attempting to rethink film grammar and the effect industry has had on it.}}</ref>  beginning with ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'' when Van Sant began using very long uninterrupted takes.
