'''Thomas Noel Rettig''', known as '''Tommy Rettig''' (December 10, 1941&nbsp;&ndash; February 15, 1996), was an [[United States|American]] [[child actor]], [[computer]] [[software engineer]], and [[author]]. Rettig is remembered for portraying the character "Jeff Miller" in the first three seasons of [[CBS]]'s ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'' [[television series]], from 1954 to 1957, later seen in [[Television syndication|syndicated]] re-runs as ''Jeff's Collie''. He also co-starred with another former child actor, [[Tony Dow]], in the mid-1960s television teen soap opera ''[[Never Too Young]]'' and recorded the song by that title with the group The TR-4.

==Early life and acting career==
Rettig was born to a [[Jewish]] father, Elias Rettig, and a [[Christian]] Italian American mother, Rosemary Nibali, in [[Jackson Heights, Queens|Jackson Heights]] in the [[Queens, New York|Queens]] borough of [[New York City]].<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67773716.html "TOMMY RETTIG, PLAYED JEFF IN ORIGINAL CAST OF TELEVISION'S 'LASSIE'"], ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', February 18, 1996. Accessed December 10, 2007.</ref> He started his career at the age of six, on tour with [[Mary Martin]] in the play ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', in which he played Little Jake.

Before his famous role as Jeff Miller in the first ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'' [[television series]], Rettig also appeared in about 18&nbsp;[[feature film]]s including ''[[So Big (1953 film)|So Big]]'', ''[[The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T]]'' (written by [[Dr. Seuss]]) and ''[[River of No Return]]'' with [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Robert Mitchum]]. It was his work with a dog in ''The 5000 Fingers Of Dr. T.'' that led [[animal training|animal trainer]] [[Rudd Weatherwax]] to urge him to audition for the ''Lassie'' role,  for which Weatherwax supplied the famous [[Rough Collie|collies]].

Rettig later told interviewers that he longed for a life as a normal teenager, and after four seasons he was able to get out of his contract. He was also critical of the treatment and compensation of child actors of his day. He reportedly received no residual payments from his work in the ''Lassie'' series, even though it was syndicated and widely shown under the title ''[[Jeff's Collie]]''.

On October 28, 1958, Rettig guest-starred in the episode "The Ghost" of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', with [[Will Hutchins]] in the title role. In the segment, Rettig played Steve Carter, a troubled youth whom Sugarfoot is taking to [[Missouri]] to collect an inheritance. In this episode, Rettig sang "[[The Streets of Laredo]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Sugarfoot_02_(1958-59).htm|title=The Ghost|publisher=Classic Television Archives|accessdate=December 11, 2013}}</ref>

He graduated in 1959 from [[University High School (Los Angeles, California)|University High School]] in Los Angeles.

At eighteen, he was cast as Pierre in the 1959 episode "The Ghost of Lafitte", set in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], of the ABC western series ''[[The Man from Blackhawk]]'', starring [[Robert Rockwell]] as a roving insurance investigator. The black actress [[Amanda Randolph]] was cast in the same episode as Auntie Cotton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/ManFromBlackhawk.htm|title=''The Man from Blackhawk''|publisher=Classic Television Archive|accessdate=January 30, 2013}}</ref>
 
In 1964&ndash;65, he co-starred with another former child actor, [[Tony Dow]], in the ABC television [[soap opera]] for teens ''[[Never Too Young]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Never Too Young on ABC|publisher=''[[TV Guide]]''|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/young/203375|accessdate=2008-10-15}}</ref> He was cast as Frank in the 1965 "The Firebrand" of the NBC education drama series ''[[Mr. Novak]]'', starring [[James Franciscus]].

With the group "The TR-4", he recorded the song by that title on the [[Velvet Tone Records|Velvet Tone label]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Jimmy Velvet|title=Inside the Dream|url=http://www.insidethedream.net|publisher=Velvet-Roese|year=2007}}</ref> While he was the TR-4 group's co-manager, he did not sing with them. Rettig only co-wrote the song in hopes of the TV soap using it as their theme. It was not chosen.<ref>http://www.break-a-way.de/pages/ringers/story.htm</ref>

==Post-acting career==
As an adult, Rettig preferred to be called "Tom." He found the transition from child star difficult, and had several well-publicized legal entanglements relating to illegal [[recreational drug]]s (a conviction for growing [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] on his farm, and a [[cocaine]] possession charge of which he was exonerated). Some years after he left acting, he became a [[motivational speaker]], which&mdash;through work on computer mailing lists&mdash;led to involvement in the early days of [[personal computer]]s.

For the last 15&nbsp;years of his life, Rettig was a well-known [[database]] [[software engineer|programmer]], [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3ATom+Rettig&qt=advanced&dblist=638 author], and expert. He was an early employee of [[Ashton-Tate]], and specialized in (sequentially) [[dBASE]], [[Clipper programming language|Clipper]], [[FoxBASE]] and finally [[FoxPro]]. Rettig moved to [[Marina del Rey]] in the late 1980s.<ref>[http://blog.seniorsafety.com/public/item/95580 Jeff Miller reminiscence]</ref>

==Later years and death==
Rettig made a guest appearance in an episode of the later television series ''[[The New Lassie]]'', with [[Jon Provost]], which aired on October 25, 1991. The series featured appearances from two other Lassie veterans, [[Roddy McDowall]], who had starred in the first movie ''[[Lassie Come Home]]'' (1943) and [[June Lockhart]], who had starred in the 1945 movie ''[[Son of Lassie]]'', and the television series (as Timmy's mother in the years after Rettig left the show).   
 
He died at fifty-four of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. His memorial service in [[Marina del Rey, California]] was attended by [[Roger Clinton, Jr.]], the [[half-brother]] of then [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]]; and several former child stars, who were featured in a photo spread in ''[[The National Enquirer]]''.
