'''Helen Mack''' (November 13, 1913 &ndash; August 13, 1986) was an American actress. Mack started her career as a [[child actress]] in [[silent film]]s, moving on to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays, and touring the [[vaudeville]] circuit. Her greater success as an actress was as a leading lady in the 1930s. Eventually Mack transitioned into performing on radio, and then into writing, directing, and producing some of the best known radio shows during the [[Golden Age of Radio]]. Later in life, Mack billed herself as a professional writer, writing for Broadway, stage, and [[television]].  Her career spanned the infancy of the motion picture industry, the beginnings of Broadway, the final days of Vaudeville, the transition to "[[talking pictures]]", the Golden Age of Radio, and the rise of television.

== Youth and stage ==
Helen Mack, born '''Helen McDougall''' was the daughter of William George McDougall, a barber,  and Regina (née Lenzer) McDougall,  who had a repressed desire to become an actress. She obtained her education (1921–29) as a youth at the Professional Children's School of [[New York City]]. Vera Gordon was a friend who helped her along as a child actress. She appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], in vaudeville (1926–28) and in stock, as well as in silent films. Mack debuted on stage in ''The Idle Inn'' with Jacob Benami. She performed with [[Roland Young]] in ''The Idle Inn'' and toured America (1928–29) with William Hodge in ''Straight Through The Door''.

== Film actress ==
Her [[Fox Film]] screen test came in March 1931 and within three weeks she was on the studio lot. Mack began her film career, first billed as Helen Macks, in ''Success''. The motion picture featured Brandon Tynan, [[Naomi Childers]], and [[Mary Astor]]. In ''Zaza'', Mack worked with [[Gloria Swanson]]. She also had a small role in [[D. W. Griffith]]'s last film ''[[The Struggle (film)|The Struggle]]'' (1931).

She made her debut as a leading lady opposite [[Victor McLaglen]] in ''While Paris Sleeps'' (1932) and was cast with [[John Boles (actor)|John Boles]] in his initial Fox Film venture, ''Scotch Valley''. Mack played in several westerns in the early 1930s. Among these are ''Fargo Express'' (1933) with [[Ken Maynard]] and ''The California Trail'' with [[Buck Jones]].

Reviewer Norbert Lusk commented favorably regarding Mack's performance in the 1933 motion picture, ''Sweepings'' (1933). He said "she has a lively personality, appreciated all the more in a heavy, loomy picture, and she plays her shopgirl role with understanding and finesse."{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Prior to this film Mack's career had declined for three years. Three of her productions failed. One reason for this career downturn is that she was usually a character star. Her employers had used Mack as an [[ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]]. [[RKO Radio Pictures Inc.]] offered her a second chance as Mamie Donahue in ''Sweepings''.

She may be best remembered for the 1933 movie sequel ''[[The Son of Kong]]'', as [[Harold Lloyd]]'s sister in ''[[The Milky Way (1936 film)|The Milky Way]]'' (1936) and as the suicidal Molly Malloy in ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940). She also played an important role as Tanya in [[Merian C. Cooper]]'s production of [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' (1935) opposite [[Randolph Scott]], [[Nigel Bruce]], and [[Helen Gahagan]] (who did the title role as ''She, who must be obeyed''). Other roles for Mack included the bank-robbing ingenue opposite [[Richard Cromwell (actor)|Richard Cromwell]] and [[Lionel Atwill]] in 1937's ''The Wrong Road'' for [[RKO]].

== WAMPAS wrangle ==
In 1931, thirteen members of the Fox Film Company publicity department resigned in protest after WAMPAS (Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers) did not include a Fox starlet on their annual list of ''baby stars''. [[Linda Watkins]] missed by one vote and Mack was a bit farther down the list of those omitted. In response Fox named Mack, Watkins, and [[Conchita Montenegro]] as rival debutantes or budding stars. Fox proposed to name ''baby stars'' for each year after, by a vote of its executives.

== Later career ==
In the 1940s and 1950s, Mack worked as a producer and director of radio programs including such series as ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]'' and ''[[Leslie Charteris|The Saint]]''. As TV succeeded radio as the prevalent entertainment medium, she continued to write plays and TV episodes until her death.

In 1949, she collaborated with [[Roger Price (comedy)|Roger Price]] in writing the children's record ''[[Gossamer Wump]]'', narrated by [[Frank Morgan]] and released by [[Capitol Records]].

== Private life ==
Mack married lawyer Charles Irwin in [[San Francisco, California]], in February 1935 at age 21. Irwin was a bankruptcy trustee for Fox Film West Coast Theaters. By this time Mack was under contract to [[Paramount Pictures]]. They had a son in 1936 and divorced in 1938.

In 1940 she married Thomas McAvity in Santa Barbara, California. McAvity later became Vice President in Charge of Television Network for NBC. They had one son. McAvity died in 1974.

In 1986, Mack died after a battle with [[cancer]].
