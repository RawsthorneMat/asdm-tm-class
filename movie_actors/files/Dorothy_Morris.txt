'''Dorothy Morris''' (February 23, 1922 – November 20, 2011) was an American film and television actress known for her "girl next door" persona.

== Early life ==
Morris was born '''Dorothy Ruth Morris''' and raised in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of a [[Methodist]] minister.
She was the younger sister of [[Caren Marsh Doll]], who later became a dancer and [[stand-in]] for [[Judy Garland]]. Morris studied acting under famed drama teacher [[Maria Ouspenskaya]]. She did a screen test for the female lead in ''The Courtship of Andy Hardy'' (1942), but lost to [[Donna Reed]].

== Career ==
Appearing in bit parts in several of the studio's more successful films, Morris was signed to an [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] contract in 1942. For one of her early film roles, ''[[Cry 'Havoc']]'' (1943), she affected a British accent.   Her next picture was the well-received drama ''[[The Human Comedy (film)|The Human Comedy]]'', which featured a star cast, headed by [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[James Craig (actor)|James Craig]] and [[Marsha Hunt (actress)|Marsha Hunt]].  Morris' role was Mary Arena; the girlfriend of [[Van Johnson]]'s character.   The highlight of her career, however, came in 1945 when she starred as the doomed Ingeborg Jensen in ''[[Our Vines Have Tender Grapes]]''. Other screen roles included ''Someone to Remember'' (1943), ''[[Pilot No. 5]]'' (1943), ''[[Rationing (1944 film)|Rationing]]'' (1944) and ''[[None Shall Escape]]'' (1944).

Morris is often remembered for her featured appearances in MGM short subjects. She appeared in several of the studio's short films including the ''[[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith Specialties]]'', ''[[The Passing Parade#Parade on film|The Passing Parade]]'', and ''Crime Does Not Pay'' series. The ''Crime'' short turned out so well that MGM expanded it into a full-length feature, ''Main Street After Dark'' in 1945. (Morris reminisces about her short-subjects experience in the [[Turner Classic Movies]] documentary  ''Added Attractions: The Hollywood Shorts Story'', first broadcast in 2002.)

== Later career ==
After she married in 1946, she took a hiatus from movie making. In the late 1950s, she made guest appearances on television series such as ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', ''[[Casey Jones]]'', and ''[[Wagon Train]]''. She made one film appearance during the 1950s in ''[[Macabre (1958 film)|Macabre]]'' (1958). Her last film role was in ''[[Seconds (film)|Seconds]]'' (1966) starring [[Rock Hudson]]. Her last television appearance was in a 1971 episode of ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]''.

== Personal life ==
Morris was married twice. Her first marriage was to math professor Marvin Moffie in 1946. They had two children. The marriage ended in divorce in 1966. Her second marriage was to church minister Roger E. Miller in 1969, but their union was short-lived and ended in a 1972 divorce.

== Death ==
Morris resided in [[Palm Springs, California]] until her death on November 20, 2011 at the age of 89.
