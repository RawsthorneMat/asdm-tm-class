Shantaram, fondly known as '''Annasaheb''', had an illustrious career as a filmmaker for almost six decades. He was one of the early filmmakers to realize the efficacy of the film medium as an instrument of social change and used it successfully to advocate humanism on one hand and expose bigotry and injustice on the other.

Some of his songs had to rehearsed several times before which they were approved by V. Shantaram.
