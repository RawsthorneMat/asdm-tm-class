Streep's father was of [[Swiss people|Swiss]]-German ancestry. Her father's lineage traces back to [[Loffenau]], [[Germany]], from where her second great-grandfather, Gottfried Streeb, emigrated to the United States, and where one of her ancestors served as mayor (the surname was later changed to "Streep").{{Sfn|Louis Gates Jr.|p=40}} Another line of her father's family was from [[Giswil]], [[Switzerland]].

However, despite her talent, she remarked that "I was singing something I didn't feel and understand. That was an important lesson—not to do that. To find the thing that I could feel through".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=7}} She quit after four years. She had many [[catholic]] school friends, and regularly attended [[Mass (religion)|mass]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/meryl-streep-movies-marriage-and-turning-sixty-1488485.html|title=Meryl Streep: Movies, marriage, and turning sixty|work= The Independent| date=24 January 2009|accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref>

Although in high school Streep appeared in numerous school plays, she was uninterested in serious theatre until acting in the play ''Miss Julie'' at [[Vassar College]] in 1969, in which she gained attention across the campus.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=8}} Vassar drama professor Clinton J Atkinson noted, "I don't think anyone ever taught Meryl acting. She really taught herself".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=8}} She demonstrated an early ability to mimic accents and to quickly memorize her lines. She received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] at the college in 1971, before applying for an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from the [[Yale School of Drama]]. At Yale she supplemented her course fees by waitressing and typing, and appeared in over a dozen stage productions a year, to the point that she became overworked, developing ulcers, which led her to contemplate quitting acting and switching to study law.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=8}} She played a variety of roles onstage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.yale.edu/humanities/theater/Meryl_Streep's_roles.doc |title=Yale library's list of all roles played at Yale by Meryl Streep |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref> from  [[Helena (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Helena]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' to an 80-year-old woman in a wheelchair in a comedy written by then-unknown playwrights [[Christopher Durang]] and [[Albert Innaurato]].{{Sfn|Gussow|1998|p=265}}<ref>{{cite news| author = [[Mel Gussow|Gussow, Mel]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/07/movies/critic-s-notebook-luring-actors-back-to-the-stage-they-left-behind.html?pagewanted=1 | title = Critic's Notebook; Luring Actors Back to the Stage They Left Behind |work= The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=7 January 1991 |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref> One of her teachers was Robert Lewis, one of the co-founders of the [[Actors Studio]], yet Streep disapproved of some of the acting exercises she was asked to do, feeling that the professors "delved into personal lives in a way I find obnoxious".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=10}}{{sfn|Pfaff|Emerson|1987|p=16}} She received her MFA from Yale in 1975.<ref name=originalprofiles/> Streep later enrolled as a visiting student at  [[Dartmouth College]] from where she received an Honorary Doctor of Arts degree in 1981.<ref name=originalprofiles>{{cite book|title=Contemporary Biography, Women: Original profiles|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bnBmAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=American Biography Service, Inc.|p=290}}</ref>

==Career==

===1970s===

====Theater and film debut====
Streep moved to New York City in 1975 where she was cast by [[Joseph Papp]] in ''[[Trelawny of the Wells]]'' opposite [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[John Lithgow]] at the Public Theater.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=10}} She went to appear in five more roles in her first year in New York, including in Papp's [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] productions of ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' with [[Raúl Juliá]], and ''Measure for Measure'' opposite [[Sam Waterston]] and [[John Cazale]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Henry V Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival|url=http://www.lortel.org/LLA_archive/index.cfm?search_by=show&id=2928|publisher=[[Lortel Archives]].

Although she had not set out for a film career, [[Robert de Niro]]'s performance in ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' had a profound impact on the young actress who said to herself, "that's the kind of actor I want to be when I grow up".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=10}} Streep began auditioning for film roles, and underwent an unsuccessful audition for the lead role in [[Dino De Laurentiis]]'s ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]''. Laurentiis stated in Italian to his son: "This is so ugly. Why did you bring me ''this''".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=7}} Unknown to Laurentiis, Streep understood Italian and she remarked, "I'm very sorry that I'm not as beautiful as I should be but, you know—this is it. This is what you get".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=8}} In New York City, she continued to work on stage. She appeared in the 1976 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] double bill of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[One act plays by Tennessee Williams#27 Wagons Full of Cotton|27 Wagons Full of Cotton]]'' and [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[A Memory of Two Mondays]]''. For the former, she received a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play]] nomination.<ref name="Lowell">{{cite book|author=Lowell, Katherine|title=Show Business|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TzymQOKwgYsC&pg=PA2001|publisher=Clinton Gilkie|page=2001|id=GGKEY:XQ5TU8D6L6X}}</ref> Her other Broadway credits include [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' and the [[Bertolt Brecht]]-[[Kurt Weill]] musical ''[[Happy End (musical)|Happy End]]'' in which she originally appeared off-Broadway at the [[Chelsea Theater Center]]. She received [[Drama Desk Award]] nominations for both productions.{{Sfn|Fisher|2011|p=772}}

Streep's first feature film role came opposite [[Jane Fonda]] in the 1977 film ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'', in which she had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress: "I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene. I thought, I've made a terrible mistake, no more movies. I hate this business".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=10}}

====Breakthrough====
Robert de Niro, who had spotted Streep in her stage production of ''The Cherry Orchard'' suggested that she play the role of his girlfriend in the war film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978).{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=21}} Cazale, who had been diagnosed with [[bone cancer]], was also cast in the film, and Streep took on the role the "vague, stock girlfriend" to remain with Cazale for the duration of filming.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|pp=19-21}}<ref>{{cite news |first=Paul |last=Gray |title=Cinema: A Mother Finds Herself |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,948649-3,00.html |work =[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |page=3 |date=3 December 1979 |accessdate=16 February 2011}}</ref>{{sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=81}} Longworth notes that Streep "made a case for female empowerment by playing a woman to whom empowerment was a foreign concept—a normal lady from an average American small town, for whom subservience was the only thing she knew".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=19}} [[Pauline Kael]], who would later become a strong critic of Streep's, stated that Streep was a "real beauty" who brought much freshness to the film with her performance.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=32}} The film's success exposed  Streep to a wider audience and earned her a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscar.go.com/nominees/actress-in-a-leading-role/meryl-streep?|title=Meryl Streep Oscar Nominations|publisher=Oscar.go.com|accessdate=2 January 2015}}</ref>

Later in 1978, Streep played a leading role in the television [[miniseries]] ''[[Holocaust (miniseries)|Holocaust]]'' as a German woman married to a [[Judaism|Jewish]] artist in [[Nazi era]] Germany. She found the material to be "unrelentingly noble" and professed to have taken on the role for financial gain.<ref name="SimplyStreepHorizonMagazine1978">{{cite web |title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.www.simplystreep.com/magazines/197808horizon.htm |accessdate=7 June 2009}} citing {{cite journal |work=Horizon Magazine |date=August 1978 |title=Star Treks}}</ref> Streep travelled to Germany and Austria for filming while Cazale remained in New York. Upon her return, Streep found that Cazale's illness had progressed, and she nursed him until his death on March 12, 1978.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=26}}{{Sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=81}} With an estimated audience of 109 million, ''Holocaust'' brought a wider degree of public recognition to Streep, who was found herself "on the verge of national visibility". She won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie]] for her performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/meryl-streep |title=Meryl Streep Emmy Award Winner |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref> Despite the awards success, Streep was not enthusiastic of a film career and preferred acting on stage.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=44}}

Hoping to divert herself from the grief of Cazale's death, Streep accepted a role in ''[[The Seduction of Joe Tynan]]'' (1979) as the chirpy love interest of [[Alan Alda]], later commenting that she played it on "automatic pilot". She performed the role of [[Kate (The Taming of the Shrew)|Katherine]] in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' for [[Shakespeare in the Park]], and also played a supporting role in ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979) for [[Woody Allen]]. Streep later said that Allen did not provide her with a complete script, giving her only the six pages of her own scenes,<ref>{{cite web |title=Magazines Archive |publisher=SimplyStreep.com |url=http://www.www.simplystreep.com/magazines/197903lookmagazine.htm |accessdate=7 June 2009}} citing {{cite journal |work=Look Magazine |date=March 1979 |title=Streep Year}}</ref> and did not permit her to improvise a word of her dialogue.{{sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=71}} In the drama ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'', Streep was cast opposite [[Dustin Hoffman]] as an unhappily married woman who abandons her husband and child. Streep thought that the script portrayed the female character as "too evil" and insisted that it was not representative of real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles. The makers agreed with her, and the script was revised.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=41}} In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a wife with a career,{{Sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=75}} and frequented the [[Upper East Side]] neighborhood in which the film was set, watching the interactions between parents and children.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=41}} The director [[Robert Benton]] allowed Streep to write her own dialogue in two key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman, who "hated her guts".{{Sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=77}} The film was controversial among feminists, but it was a role which film critic [[Stephen Farber]] believed displayed Streep's "own emotional intensity", writing that she was one of the "rare performers who can imbue the most routine moments with a hint of mystery".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=46}}

For ''Kramer vs. Kramer'', Streep won both the Academy Award and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The 52nd Academy Awards {{!}} 1980|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1980|publisher=Oscars.

====Rise to stardom====
[[File:Meryl Streep (2071470089) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Streep at the [[61st Academy Awards]], March 1989]]
In 1979, Streep began workshopping ''Alice in Concert'', a musical version of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' with writer and composer [[Elizabeth Swados]] and director Joseph Papp; the show was put on at New York's Public Theater from December 1980. [[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to Streep as the "one wonder" of the production. but questioned why she had devoted so much energy to it.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=44}} By 1980, Streep had progressed to leading roles in films. She was featured on the cover of ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine with the headline "A Star for the 80s", with [[Jack Kroll]] commenting, "There's a sense of mystery in her acting; she doesn't simply imitate. (although she's a great mimic in private). She transmits a sense of danger, a primal unease lying just below the surface of normal behavior".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=49}} Streep denounced the fervent media coverage of her at this time as "excessive hype".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=49}}

The [[story within a story]] drama ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman (film)|The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1981) was Streep's first leading role. The film paired Streep with [[Jeremy Irons]] as contemporary actors, telling their modern story as well as the [[Victorian era]] drama they were performing.

[[Vincent Canby]], writing for ''The New York Times'', noted that the film was an homage to the works of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], but that one of its main weaknesses was a lack of chemistry between Streep and Scheider, concluding that Streep "is stunning, but she's not on screen anywhere near long enough".<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title='Still of the Night', in Hitchcock Manner |work= The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=20 September 1985 |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E2D8123BF93AA25752C1A964948260 |accessdate=6 June 2009}}</ref>

Greater success came later in 1982, when Streep starred in the drama ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982), portraying a [[Poland|Polish]] [[holocaust survivor]] caught in a love triangle between a young naive writer ([[Peter MacNicol]]) and a Jewish intellectual ([[Kevin Kline]]). Streep's emotional dramatic performance and her apparent mastery of a Polish accent drew praise.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Eric D.

She obtained a pirated copy of the script, and threw herself on the ground begging the director [[Alan J.

There is hardly an emotion that Streep doesn't touch in this movie, and yet we're never aware of her straining. This is one of the most astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances I can imagine."{{Sfn|Ebert|2010|p=222}} Pauline Kael on the contrary called the film an "infuriatingly bad movie" and thought that Streep "decorporealizes" herself, which she believed explained why her movie heroines "don't seem to be full characters, and why there are no incidental joys to be had from watching her".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|pp=62, 53}}

The year 1983 saw Streep play her first real-life character, the [[nuclear whistleblowers|nuclear whistleblower]] and a [[labor union]] [[activist]] who died in a suspicious [[car accident]] while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the [[Kerr-McGee]] [[plutonium]] plant, in [[Mike Nichols]]'s biographical film ''[[Silkwood]]''. Streep felt a personal connection to Silkwood, believing herself to be very close to her with her background,{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=69}} and in preparation she met with people close to Silkwood and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality.{{sfn|Ebert|2006|p=64}} She said, "I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside."{{Sfn|Ebert|2006|p=64}} Jack Kroll of ''Newsweek'' considered Streep's characterization to have been "brilliant", adding that "we feel [her] awakening in our own nonradioactive bones", although Pauline Kael believed that Streep had been miscast.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=78}} Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens expressed approval in that Streep had played Karen as a human being rather than a myth, although Karen's father Bill thought that Streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=78}} She next played opposite Robert De Niro in the romance ''[[Falling in Love (1984 film)|Falling in Love]]'' (1984) and portrayed a fighter for the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]] in the British drama ''[[Plenty (film)|Plenty]]'' (1985). For the latter, Roger Ebert wrote that she conveyed "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms."<ref>{{cite news |last=Ebert |first=Roger |title='Plenty' review |work=Chicago Sun Times |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19850920/REVIEWS/509200303/1023 |date=19 November 1982 |accessdate=6 June 2009}}</ref> In 2008, Molly Haskell praised Streep's performance in ''Plenty'', believing it to be "one of Streep's most difficult and ambiguous" films and "most feminist" role.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=92}}

====''Out of Africa'' and backlash====
Longworth considers Streep's next release,  ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985), to have established her as a Hollywood superstar. In the film, Streep starred as the Danish writer [[Karen Blixen]] opposite  [[Robert Redford]]'s [[Denys Finch Hatton]]. Director [[Sydney Pollack]] was initially dubious about Streep in the role as he didn't think she was sexy enough, and had considered [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] for the part. Pollack recalls that Streep impressed him in a different way: "She was so direct, so honest, so without bullshit. There was no shielding between her and me.".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=81}} Streep and Pollack often clashed during the 101-day shoot in Kenya, particularly over Blixen's voice. Streep had spent much time listening to tapes of Blixen and began speaking in an old-fashioned and aristocratic fashion, which Pollack thought excessive.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=88}} A significant commercial and critical success, the film earned Streep another Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, also winning Best Picture.  Critic [[Stanley Kaufmann]] wrote, "Meryl Streep is back in top form. This means her performance in ''Out of Africa'' is at the highest level of acting in film today".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=93}}

Longworth notes that the dramatic success of ''Out of Africa'' led to a backlash of critical opinion against Streep in the years that followed, especially as she was now demanding $4 million a picture. Unlike other stars at the time such as [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Tom Cruise]], Streep "never seemed to play herself", and certain critics felt her technical finesse led people to ''see'' her acting.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=97}} Her next films did not appeal to a wide audience; she co-starred with [[Jack Nicholson]] in the dramas ''[[Heartburn (film)|Heartburn]]'' (1986) and ''[[Ironweed (film)|Ironweed]]'' (1987), in which she sang onscreen for the first time since the television movie, ''Secret Service'' (1977). In ''[[Evil Angels (film)|A Cry in the Dark]]'', she played [[Lindy Chamberlain]], an Australian woman who had been convicted of the [[Death of Azaria Chamberlain|murder of her infant daughter]] despite claiming that the baby had been taken by a [[dingo]]. Filmed in Australia, Streep won the [[Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]],{{sfn|Waldo|2006|p=209}}{{sfn|Speed|Wilson|1989|p=38}}{{sfn|Eberwein p.217|2010|p=217}}{{sfn|Newsweek|1988|p=85}} a [[Prix d'interprétation féminine|Best Actress]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]].{{Sfn|Eberwein|2010|p=221}}

In 1989, Streep lobbied to play the lead role in [[Oliver Stone]]'s adaption of the play ''Evita'', but two months before filming was due to commence she dropped out, citing "exhaustion" initially, although it was later revealed that there was a dispute over her salary.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=99}} By the end of the decade, Streep actively looked to star in a comedy. She found the role in ''[[She-Devil (film)|She-Devil]]'' (1989), a satire that parodied Hollywood's obsession with beauty and cosmetic surgery, in which she played a glamorous writer.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=106}} Though not a success, [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' wrote that Streep was the "one reason" to see the film and observed that it marked a departure from the dramatic roles she was known to play.<ref>{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |title=Warty Worm, "She-Devil" review |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959340,00.html |work=Time magazine |date=11 December 1989 |accessdate=7 June 2009}}</ref> Reacting to her string of poorly received films, Streep said: "Audiences are shrinking, As the marketing strategy defines more and more narrowly who they want to reach—males from 16 to 25—it's become a chicken-and-egg syndrome. Which came first? First they release all these summer movies, then do a demographic survey of who's going to see them".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=99}}

===1990s===
====Unsuccessful comedies; ''The Bridges of Madison County''====
[[File:Meryl in 1990.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Meryl Streep at the [[32nd Grammy Awards]] in 1990]]
Biographer Karen Hollinger described the early 1990s as a downturn in the popularity of Streep's films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious but commercially unsuccessful dramas, and more significantly to the lack of options available to an actress in her forties.{{Sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=78}} Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family,{{Sfn|Hollinger|2006|p=78}} a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, "By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in her anymore. And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've got to pick your parts with great care."<ref name="NewYorkMagazineSep1981" /> At the [[Screen Actor's Guild]] National Women's Conference in 1990, Streep keynoted the first national event, emphasizing the decline in women's work opportunities, pay parity, and role models within the film industry.<ref name="SAG timeline">{{cite web |title=SAG History - SAG Timeline |url=http://www.sag.org/content/womens-committee |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120125115603/http://www.sag.org/content/womens-committee |archivedate=2012-01-25 |accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> She criticized the film industry for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off.{{sfn|Eberwein|2010|p=221}}

After roles in the comedy-drama ''[[Postcards from the Edge (film)|Postcards from the Edge]]'' (1990) and the comedy-fantasy ''[[Defending Your Life]]'', Streep starred with [[Goldie Hawn]] in farcical black comedy, ''[[Death Becomes Her]]'' (1992), with [[Bruce Willis]] as their co-star. Streep persuaded writer [[David Koepp]] to rewrite several of the scenes, particularly the one in which her character has an affair with a younger man, which she believed was "unrealistically male" in its conception. The seven-month shoot was the longest of Streep's career, during which got into character by "thinking about being slightly pissed off all of the time".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|pp=100, 103}} Due to Streep's allergies to numerous cosmetics, special prosthetics had to be designed to age her by ten years to look 54, although Streep believed that it made her look nearer 70.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=103}} Longworth considers ''Death Becomes Her'' to have been "the most physical performance Streep had yet committed to screen, all broad weeping, smirking, and eye-rolling".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=100}} Although it was a commercial success, earning $15.1 million in just five days, Streep's contribution to comedy was generally not taken well by critics.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=107}}  ''Time''{{'}}s Richard Corliss wrote approvingly of Streep's "wicked-witch routine" but dismissed the film as "''She-Devil'' with a make-over" and one which "hates women".<ref>{{cite news |last=Corliss |first=Richard |title=Beverly Hills Corpse, "Death Becomes Her" review |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976129,00.html |work=Time |date=3 August 1992 |accessdate=7 June 2009}}</ref>{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=107}}

[[File:Meryl Streep - Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]'']]

In 1993, Streep appeared with [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Glenn Close]] and [[Winona Ryder]] in ''[[The House of the Spirits (film)|The House of the Spirits]]'', set during the military dictatorship of Chile. The film was not well received by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_house_of_the_spirits/|title=The House of the Spirits|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]. [[Flixster]]|accessdate=9 April 2015}}</ref> The following year, she featured in ''[[The River Wild]]'', as the mother of children on a whitewater rafting trip who encounter two violent criminals ([[Kevin Bacon]] and [[John C. Reilly]]) in the wilderness. Though critical reaction was generally mixed, [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' found her to be "strong, sassy and looser than she has ever been onscreen".<ref>{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|title=The River Wild|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-river-wild-19940930|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=September 20, 1994|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref>

Streep's most successful film of the decade came in the 1995 romance ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (film)|The Bridges of Madison County]]'' from director [[Clint Eastwood]], who adapted the film from [[Robert James Waller]]'s novel of the same name.{{Sfn|McGilligan|1999|p=492}} It relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', who has a love affair with a middle-aged Italian farm wife in [[Iowa]] named Francesca (Streep). Though Streep disliked the novel it was based on, she found the script to be a special opportunity for an actress her age.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|pp=111-12}} She gained weight for the part, and dressed differently than the character in the book to emulate the voluptuous Italian film stars such as [[Sophia Loren]]. Both Loren and [[Anna Magnani]] were an influence in her portrayal, and Streep viewed [[Pier Paolo Passolini]]'s ''[[Mamma Roma]]'' (1962) prior to filming.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=115}} The film was a box office hit and grossed over $70 million in the United States.{{Sfn|McGilligan|1999|p=503}} The film, unlike the novel, was warmly received by critics. Janet Maslin of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Eastwood had managed to create "a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Waller's self-congratulatory overkill", while [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' described it as "one of the most pleasurable films in recent memory".{{Sfn|McGilligan|1999|p=503}} Longworth believes that Streep's performance was "crucial to transforming what could have been a weak soap opera into a vibrant work of historical fiction implicitly critiquing postwar America's stifling culture of domesticity".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}} She believes that it was a role in which Streep became "arguably the first middle-aged actress to be taken seriously by Hollywood as a romantic heroine".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=117}}

====Career struggles====
In 1996, Streep played the estranged sister of Bessie ([[Diane Keaton]]), a woman battling [[leukemia]],  in ''[[Marvin's Room (film)|Marvin's Room]]'', an adaptation of the play by Scott McPherson. Streep recommended Keaton for the role.{{Sfn|Mitchell|2001|p=139}} The film also starred a young [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Streep's character's rebellious son. Roger Ebert stated that "Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970110/REVIEWS/701100302/1023 |title=Review- Marvin's Room|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=10 January 1997|accessdate=25 March 2006}}</ref> The film was critically acclaimed, and Streep earned another Golden Globe nomination for her performance.<ref name=GoldenGlobes />

In 1998, Streep played an Irishwoman opposite [[Michael Gambon]] and [[Catherine McCormack]] in  [[Pat O'Connor (director)|Pat O'Connor]]'s ''[[Dancing at Lughnasa (film)|Dancing at Lughnasa]]''. It was entered into the [[Venice Film Festival]] of 1998, and Streep was nominated for a [[Cinema of Ireland#Irish Film & Television Awards|Irish Film and Television Best Actress Award]]. Later that year, she played a cancer sufferer caught in a difficult family situation, playing the mother of [[Renée Zellweger]] and wife of [[William Hurt]] in ''[[One True Thing]]''. The film was well received by critics. [[Mick LaSalle]] in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' declared, "After 'One True Thing', critics who persist in the fiction that Streep is a cold and technical actress will need to get their heads examined. She is so instinctive and natural - so thoroughly in the moment and operating on flights of inspiration - that she's able to give us a woman who's at once wildly idiosyncratic and utterly believable."<ref name="LaSalle">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/09/18/DD59798.DTL|title=Home Is a Beautiful `Thing' / Streep shines in drama about ailing mother|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|date=18 September 1998|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' film critic Kenneth Turan noted that Streep's role "is one of the least self-consciously dramatic and surface showy of her career, but that she "adds a level of honesty and reality that makes [her performance] one of her most moving."<ref name="Turan">{{cite news|title=One True Thing|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|date=18 September 1998|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> In 1999, Streep portrayed [[Roberta Guaspari]], a real-life New Yorker who found passion and enlightenment teaching violin to inner-city kids in [[East Harlem]], in the music drama ''[[Music of the Heart]]''.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that "Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she may be the most versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents.

==Artistry==
Streep has stated that she grew up listening to artists such as  [[Barbra Streisand]], [[The Beatles]] and [[Bob Dylan]],and she learned a lot about how to use her voice, her instrument, by listening to Barbra Streisand's albums.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Barbra Streisand music inspired Meryl Streep|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/02/06/146362798/meryl-streep-the-fresh-air-interview?ft=1&f=13 | publisher = examiner.com | accessdate=February 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Meryl Streep: The Fresh Air Interview|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/02/06/146362798/meryl-streep-the-fresh-air-interview?ft=1&f=13 | publisher = [[National Public Radio]] | accessdate=February 6, 2015}}</ref> She brought up them in an NPR interview called "Fresh Air." Meryl was promoting her new film, "The Iron Lady," in which she played the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher"That's my way in, the very beginning, how to enter it. Very quickly in the process, I don't think of voice as being separate from the way you hold your head or the way you sit or the way you put on lipstick. It's all a piece of a person, and it's all driven by conviction. All the physical manifestations — you need your way in. When I was a kid — 16, 17 — I'd come home from high school, and my dad collected all of [[Barbra Streisand]]'s records. She probably had three records out and she was 21. And I knew every single song, every breath, every elision, every swell. And I sang along to it. But for me, it was a way for me to get out the feeling in the song, and the feelings in high school that ... I had no other way of expressing.I was 13. I didn't like opera. Ew. I liked cheerleading and boys — that was what I was interested in, and [[Barbra Streisand]], [[The Beatles]] and [[Bob Dylan]]. But I loved singing. I loved it. And I did have a very good coloratura. I listened to my high school Music Man just as I was getting ready to get the Kennedy Center Honors with Barbara Cook, because I had been to see her when I was a kid in The Music Man on Broadway. And I had sung the part in my high school production and it's very good, but it's a voice I don't have anymore. It was very high and light and free."<ref>{{cite news |title=How Barbra Streisand music inspired Meryl Streep|url=http://www.npr.org/2014/12/19/371657834/meryl-streep-the-fresh-air-intervie | publisher = [[National Public Radio]]| accessdate=February 7, 2012}}</ref>

==Acting style and legacy==

{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="Women are better at acting than men. Why? Because we have to be. If successfully convincing somebody bigger than you of something he doesn't know is a survival skill, this is how women have survived through the millennia. Pretending is not just play. Pretending is imagined possibility. Pretending or acting is a very valuable life skill, and we all do it. All the time."|source=—Streep on acting.
{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=7}}}}
Despite her success, Streep has always been modest about her own acting and achievements in cinema. She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she can't be articulate. She said in 1987, "I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say 'Now which one would you like'? Nothing I can count on and that makes it more dangerous. But then the danger makes it more exciting.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}} She has stated that her ideal director is one which gives her complete artistic control, and allowing a degree of improvization and her to learn from her own mistakes. Karina Longworth notes how "external" Streep's performances are, "chameleonic" in her impersonation of characters, "subsuming herself into them, rather than personifying them".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}} In her early roles such as ''Manhattan'' and ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' she was compared to both [[Diane Keaton]] and [[Jill Clayburgh]], in that her characters were "baldy unsympathetic", which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and are devoid of a mutual emotional understanding with others.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=12}} Streep has stated that many consider her to be a technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, "I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}} 
[[File:Meryl streep (8507558610).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Streep at the [[85th Academy Awards]] in February 2013]]
Mike Nichols, who directed Streep in ''Silkwood'', ''Heartburn'' and ''Postcards from the Edge'' praised Streep's ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that "in every role she becomes a totally new human being. As she becomes the person she is portraying, the other performers begin to react to her as if she were that person".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=70}}  He said that directing her is "so much like falling in love that it has the characteristics of a time which you remember as magical but which is shrouded in mystery".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=73}} He also noted that Streep's acting ability had a profound impact on her co-stars and that one could improve by 1000% purely by watching her. {{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=70}} 
Longworth believes that in nearly every film, Streep has "sly infused" a feminist point of view in her portrayals.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=15}}  However, film critic [[Molly Haskell]] has stated, "None of her heroines are feminist, strictly speaking. Yet they uncannily embody various crosscurrents of experience in the last twenty years, as women have redefined themselves against the background of the women's movement".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=16}}

In the 1988 film ''[[Evil Angels (film)|A Cry in the Dark]]'', in which she portrays a New Zealand transplant to Australia, Streep perfected a hybrid of Australian & New Zealand English.

==Personal life==
Streep lived with actor [[John Cazale]] for three years until his death in March 1978. [[Al Pacino]] remarked that "I've hardly ever seen a person so devoted to someone who is falling away like John was. To see her in that act of love for this man was overwhelming."<ref name=EW>{{cite web|author1=Fretts, Bruce|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,422759,00.html|title=Unfortunate Son|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc.||date=21 February 2003}}</ref> Streep said of his death, "I didn't get over it. I don't want to get over it. No matter what you do, the pain is always there in some recess of your mind, and it affects everything that happens afterwards. I think you can assimilate the pain and go on without making an obsession of it".{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=46}}

Streep married sculptor [[Don Gummer]] six months after Cazale's death on September 30, 1978.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Hw4gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pmUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1223,438388&dq=meryl+streep+don+gummer&hl=en The Lewiston Daily Sun, October 3, 1978].

Author Karina Longworth notes that despite her "high level of stardom" for decades, Streep has managed to maintain a relatively normal personal life.{{sfn|Longworth|2013|p=7}}

When asked if religion plays a part in her life in 2009, Streep replied: "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an [[ashram]]."<ref>"Movies, Marriage, and Turning Sixty'. ''[[The Independent]]''. 24 January 2009.</ref> In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: "So I've always been really, deeply interested, because I think I can understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe in the power of prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there."<ref name="The Telegraph" />

When asked from where she draws consolation in the face of aging and death, Streep responded: "Consolation? I'm not sure I have it. I have a belief, I guess, in the power of the aggregate human attempt – the best of ourselves. In love and hope and optimism – you know, the magic things that seem inexplicable. Why we are the way we are. I do have a sense of trying to make things better.
