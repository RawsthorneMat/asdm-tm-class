Butler was head boy at [[St Mirin's Academy|St Mirin's & St Margaret's High School]] in Paisley and achieved respectable grades—good enough to win a place to study [[University of Glasgow School of Law|law]] at the [[University of Glasgow]].<ref name=dailyrecord>{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Stephen|title=Gerard Butler's school pal on how Hollywood star phoned to grovel after branding her a flirt on TV |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/gerard-butlers-school-pal-on-how-1054405 |accessdate=1 February 2013|newspaper=Daily Record|date=28 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=mensjournal>{{cite news|last=Hedegaard|first=Erik|title=Gerry the Sinner, Gerry the Saint|url=http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/gerry-the-sinner-gerry-the-saint-gerard-butler-20121031?page=3|accessdate=1 February 2013 |newspaper=Men's Journal|date=April 2010}}</ref> He also attended [[Scottish Youth Theatre]] while a teenager. Butler did not see his father again until he was 16 years old, when Edward Butler called to meet him at a Glasgow restaurant. After this meeting, Butler cried for hours, and recalled of it later: "That emotion showed me how much pain can sit in this body of yours; pain and sorrow that you don’t know you have until it is unleashed."<ref name="telegraph" />

Butler became close to his father after this reunion. Around the same time, he also accepted Glasgow University's offer to study law. During his time as a student, he became the President of the university law society,<ref name="paisley">{{cite web|url=http://www.paisley.org.uk/famous-people/gerard-butler/ |title=Gerard Butler &#124; Paisley Scotland |publisher=Paisley.org.uk |date= |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref> a position Butler later said he "kind of blagged my way into".<ref name=esq/> He also sang in a rock band called Speed.<ref>{{cite web|author=LadyThrills |url=http://ladythrills.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/gerard-butler.html |title=LadyThrills.com: Gerard Butler |publisher=Ladythrills.blogspot.co.uk |date=14 October 2007 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref> While Butler was a 22-year-old student, his father was diagnosed with cancer and died. He would say of this period in his life: "I had gone from a 16-year-old who couldn't wait to grasp life to a 22-year-old who didn't care if he died in his sleep."<ref name="telegraph_a">{{cite news |author=Stars and Stories |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/5836476/Gerard-Butler-interview-for-The-Ugly-Truth.html |title=Gerard Butler interview for The Ugly Truth |publisher=Telegraph |date= 20 July 2009|accessdate=7 May 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

Before his final year of law school, Butler took a year off to live in [[California]]. He mostly lived in [[Venice Beach]], working at different jobs, travelling often, and, according to him, drinking heavily, at one point being arrested for alcohol-related disorderly conduct.<ref name=esq/> Butler later described this year as, "I was out of control, and justifying it with this idea that 'I'm young, this is life. This is me just being boisterous." After his time off in America, he returned to Scotland to finish his final year at law school.<ref name=esq/>

==Career==
===Legal career and early acting career===
Upon graduation, he won a position as a trainee lawyer at an [[Edinburgh]] law firm. However, his lifestyle remained unrestrained and he frequently missed work due to his partying antics. One week before he qualified as a lawyer, he was fired. At the age of 25, and an unqualified lawyer, Butler moved to London to pursue his dream of becoming famous. He admitted, "When I started out, I'm not sure I was actually in it for the right reasons. I wanted very much to be famous."<ref name="telegraph" />

Unable to win any acting roles initially, he worked in a variety of jobs including as a waiter, a telemarketer and a demonstrator of how toys work at fairs. Whilst in London, he met an old friend from his teenage days in the Scottish Youth Theatre, who was now a London casting agent. At that time, he was her boyfriend and her assistant. She took him to an audition for [[Steven Berkoff]]'s play of ''[[Coriolanus]]''.<ref name="paisley" /> The director said of Butler's audition, "When he read, he had such vigour and enthusiasm—so much that it made the other actors seem limp—that I decided to cast him in the ensemble."<ref name="telegraph_a" />

Now aged 27, Butler had his first professional acting job. Less than a year later, he won a part in a theatre adaptation of ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', which he performed at the Edinburgh Festival. Aged 30, Butler decided to move to Los Angeles; there he won parts in ''[[Dracula 2000]]'', ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life|Tomb Raider 2]]'', ''[[Dear Frankie]]'', and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]''.<ref name="telegraph_a" />

===Acting career===
In [[London]], Butler held a series of odd jobs until being cast by actor and director [[Steven Berkoff]] (who later appeared alongside him in ''[[Attila (TV miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001)) in a stage production of ''[[Coriolanus]]''. He was cast as [[Ewan McGregor]]'s character Renton in the stage adaptation of ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', the same play that had inspired him to become an actor.<ref name="film"/> His film debut was as [[Billy Connolly]]'s character's younger brother in ''[[Mrs. Brown]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs Brown|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0078lkb|publisher=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>

His film career continued with small roles, first in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997)<ref name="film">{{cite web|title=Gerard Butler Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gerard-butler-20808745|publisher=biography.com|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> and then [[Russell Mulcahy]]'s ''[[Tale of the Mummy]]'' (1998). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being Attila the Hun in the American TV miniseries ''[[Attila (TV miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001). The film's producers wanted a known actor to play the part but eventually chose Butler.<ref>{{cite web|title=Attila: hot babes, baths and, erm, birth control|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/28/reel-history-attila-gerard-butler|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=28 January 2010}}</ref> He was cast as Dracula in ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' (2000).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Graph Of Manliness: Gerard Butle|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/graph-of-manliness-gerard-butler/|publisher=empireonline.com|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>

In 2003, director [[Joel Schumacher]] was deciding on the principal casting for the film ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', a film adaptation of the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|musical of the same name]], and thought of Butler, whom he had seen earlier in the film ''Dracula 2000'', to play the title character. Butler, who had had no musical experience other than singing in a rock band while he was studying to be a lawyer, was surprised at the interest, but immediately began taking singing lessons with a [[vocal coach]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/12/08/gerard_butler_the_phantom_of_the_opera_interview.shtml Gerard Butler phantom of the opera] Stella Papamichael, 2004</ref> He then did an acting audition with Schumacher, and a singing audition with Lloyd Webber, both of whom were impressed by his performance.<ref>[http://www.femail.com.au/phantom-of-the-opera-gerard-butler-pf.htm Gerard Butler – Phantom of the Opera interview], Paul Fischer, ''femail.com.au'', 2004</ref> Despite the film receiving mixed reviews, Butler was praised for his performance.

Other projects that followed include ''[[Dear Frankie]]'' (2005), ''[[The Game of Their Lives (2005 film)|The Game of Their Lives]]'' (2005) and ''[[Beowulf & Grendel]]'' (2005).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Murray|first1=Rebecca|title=Gerard Butler Talks About The Phantom and "Beowulf and Grendel"|url=http://movies.about.com/od/dearfrankie/a/frankiegb030205_4.htm|accessdate=25 February 2015|publisher=About.com}}</ref>
