==Style and themes==
Ceylan's films deal with the estrangement of the individual, existentialism, the monotony of human lives, and the details of everyday life. He uses [[Dutch angle|static shot]]s and [[long take]]s, usually in natural settings, as well as play with sound, including the use of menacing silences.  He is known for filming his [[protagonist]] from behind, which, in his view, leaves the audiences to speculate on the brooding emotions of characters whose faces are obscured. Ceylan makes films on an extremely low budget. His casts generally consist of amateur actors, most of whom are his family members, including his mother and father.

Ceylan named his ten favorite films in the 2012 Sight & Sound Greatest Films Poll: 
''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966), ''[[Au Hasard Balthazar]]'' (1966), ''[[L'Avventura]]'' (1960), ''[[L'Eclisse]]'' (1962), ''[[Late Spring]]'' (1949), ''[[A Man Escaped]]'' (1956), ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' (1975), ''[[Persona (film)|Persona]]'' (1966), ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]'' (1968), and ''[[Tokyo Story]]'' (1953).<ref>[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/1095 Nuri Bilge Ceylan | BFI | BFI].
