==Career==

===Overview===
Gibson gained very favorable notices from film critics when he first entered the cinematic scene, as well as comparisons to several classic movie stars. In 1982, [[Vincent Canby]] wrote that "Mr. Gibson recalls the young [[Steve McQueen]]... I can't define "star quality," but whatever it is, Mr. Gibson has it."<ref>{{cite news | title = New Faces Brighten a Mixed Batch of Movies | author=Vincent Canby |work=The New York Times| date = August 29, 1982 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/29/movies/film-view-new-faces-brighten-a-mixed-batch-of-movies.html }}</ref> Gibson has also been likened to "a combination [[Clark Gable]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]."<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite news | title = Mel Gibson: Australia's new hunk | author=Vernon Scott | agency=[[United Press International]] | date = February 24, 1983}}</ref> Gibson's roles in the ''Mad Max'' series of films, [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'', and the ''Lethal Weapon'' series of films earned him the label of "action hero".<ref name="Cagle">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998731-1,00.html|title=Cinema: A Softer Side of Mel|last=Cagle|first=Jess|date=December 11, 2000|work=Time|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref> Later, Gibson expanded into a variety of acting projects including human dramas such as ''[[Hamlet]]'', and comedic roles such as those in ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'' and ''[[What Women Want]]''.

In 1982 Gibson again attracted critical acclaim in [[Peter Weir]]'s romantic thriller ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''.

{{Main|Mad Max (franchise)}}
Gibson got his breakthrough role as the leather-clad post-apocalyptic survivor in [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]]'s ''[[Mad Max]]''. The independently financed blockbuster helped to make him an international star everywhere but in the United States, where the actors' Australian accents were dubbed with American accents.<ref name="Gilbey">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=201887|title=Been to hear any good films lately?|last=Gilbey|first=Ryan|date=July 25, 2001|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref> The original film spawned two sequels: ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' (known in North America as ''The Road Warrior''), and ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome|Mad Max 3]]'' (known in North America as ''Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'').

===''Gallipoli''===
{{Main|Gallipoli (1981)}}
The 1981 [[Peter Weir]] film, ''Gallipoli'' is about a group of young men from rural [[Western Australia]] who enlist in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I]]. They are sent to invade the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they take part in the 1915 [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. During the course of the movie, the young men slowly lose their innocence about the war. The climax of the movie centers around the catastrophic AIF offensive known as the [[Battle of the Nek]].

[[Peter Weir]] cast Gibson in the role of Frank Dunne, an [[Irish-Australian]] drifter with an intense [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] about fighting for the [[British Empire]]. Newcomer [[Mark Lee (actor)|Mark Lee]] was recruited to play the idealistic Archy Hamilton after participating in a photo session for the director. Gibson later recalled:
<blockquote>"I'd auditioned for an earlier film and he told me right up front, 'I'm not going to cast you for this part. You're not old enough. But thanks for coming in, I just wanted to meet you.' He told me he wanted me for ''Gallipoli'' a couple of years later because I wasn't the archetypal Australian. He had [[Mark Lee (actor)|Mark Lee]], the angelic-looking, ideal Australian kid, and he wanted something of a modern sensibility. He thought the audience needed someone to relate to<!-- OK here: don't correct it--> of their own time."<ref>{{cite news | title = Mel's Movies | author = Michael Fleming | publisher = Movieline |date=July 2000}}</ref></blockquote>

Gibson later said that ''Gallipoli'' is, "Not really a war movie. That's just the backdrop. It's really the story of two young men."

The critically acclaimed film helped to further launch Gibson's career.<ref>{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Thomas |title='Gallipoli' an Australian project |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19810921&id=6owxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oQIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4621,4985783 |newspaper=The Blade |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Google News Archive |date=September 21, 1981 |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>Davies, Greg.

===''The Year of Living Dangerously''===
{{Main|The Year of Living Dangerously (film)}}
Gibson played a naïve but ambitious journalist opposite [[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[Linda Hunt]] in [[Peter Weir]]'s atmospheric 1982 film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'', based on the novel of the same name by [[Christopher Koch]]. The movie was both a critical and commercial success, and the upcoming Australian actor was heavily marketed by [[MGM]] studio. In his review of the film, Vincent Canby of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr. Gibson, then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence."<ref>{{cite news | title = Year of Living Dangerously | author=Vincent Canby |work=The New York Times| date = January 21, 1983 | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9951A0C0173BF932A35750C8BF67 }}</ref> According to John Hiscock of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the film did, indeed, establish Gibson as an international talent.<ref name="Hiscock">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/7044121/Mel-Gibson-interview.html|title=Mel Gibson interview|last=Hiscock|first=John|date=January 21, 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=July 20, 2010 }}</ref>

Gibson was initially reluctant to accept the role of Guy Hamilton. "I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way."<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite news | title = Mel's Movies | author=Michael Fleming | publisher=Movieline |date=July 2000}}</ref> Gibson saw some similarities between himself and the character of Guy.

===''The Bounty''===
{{Main|The Bounty}}
Gibson followed the footsteps of [[Errol Flynn]], [[Clark Gable]], and [[Marlon Brando]] by starring as [[Fletcher Christian]] in a cinematic retelling of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]]. The resulting 1984 film ''[[The Bounty]]'' is considered to be the most historically accurate version. However, Gibson has expressed a belief that the film's revisionism did not go far enough. He has stated that his character should have been portrayed as the film's [[antagonist]]. He has further praised [[Anthony Hopkins]]'s performance as Lieutenant [[William Bligh]] as the best aspect of the film.<ref name="autogenerated3" />

===''Lethal Weapon'' series===
{{Main|Lethal Weapon (film series)}}
Gibson moved into more mainstream commercial filmmaking with the popular [[buddy cop]] ''Lethal Weapon'' series, which began with the 1987 original. In the films he played [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective [[Martin Riggs]], a recently widowed [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran with a death wish and a penchant for violence and gunplay. In the films, he is partnered with a reserved family man named [[Roger Murtaugh]] ([[Danny Glover]]). Following the success of ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'', director [[Richard Donner]] and principal cast revisited the characters in three sequels, ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'' (1989), ''[[Lethal Weapon 3]]'' (1993), and ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'' (1998). With its fourth installment, the ''Lethal Weapon'' series embodied "the quintessence of the [[Buddy cop film|buddy cop pic]]".<ref name="Klady">{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117477677.html |title=Lethal Weapon 4 Review|last=Klady|first=Leonard|date=July 8, 1998|work=Variety |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref>

===''Hamlet''===
{{Main|Hamlet (1990 film)}}
Gibson made the unusual transition from action to classical drama, playing  [[William Shakespeare]]'s Danish prince in [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s [[Hamlet (1990 film)|''Hamlet'']]. Gibson was cast alongside experienced [[Shakespearean]] actors [[Ian Holm]], [[Alan Bates]], and [[Paul Scofield]]. He compared working with Scofield to being "thrown into the ring with [[Mike Tyson]]".<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1582308/Paul-Scofields-career-highlights.html Paul Scofield's career highlights], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', March 20, 2008.

===''Braveheart''===
{{Main|Braveheart}}
In 1995, Mel Gibson directed, produced, and starred in ''[[Braveheart]]'', a [[biopic]] of Sir [[William Wallace]], a Scottish nationalist who was executed in 1305 for "[[high treason]]" against King [[Edward I of England]]. Gibson received two [[Academy Award]]s, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], for his second directorial effort. In winning the Academy Award for Best Director, Gibson became only the sixth actor-turned-filmmaker to do so.<ref name=AW95>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/aa95.html |title=1995 Academy Awards |publisher=Filmsite.org |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Braveheart]]'' influenced the Scottish nationalist movement and helped to revive the film genre of the historical epic; the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] sequence is considered by critics to be one of the all-time-best-directed battle scenes.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/29/movie.battles/] The best&nbsp;– and worst&nbsp;– movie battle scenes April 2, 2007</ref>

The film's depiction of the [[Edward II of England|Prince of Wales]] as an effeminate [[homosexual]] caused the film to be attacked by the Gay Alliance. The Gay Alliance was especially enraged by a scene in which King Edward I murders his son's male lover by throwing him out of a castle window.

Gibson, who had previously been reported making several homophobic statements,<ref name="sfbay" /> now replied, "The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody."<ref>{{citation

Gibson asserted that the reason that king Edward I kills his son's lover is because the king is a "[[Psychopathy|psychopath]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/Issues/1995-05-25/film/film_3.html | title=Mel Gibson talks about Braveheart, movie stardom, and media treachery | author=Matt Zoller Seitz | publisher=Dallas Observer | accessdate=January 27, 2008}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> Gibson also expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers laughed at this murder:

===''The Passion of the Christ''===
{{Main|The Passion of the Christ}}
Gibson directed, produced, co-wrote, and funded the 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]],'' which chronicled the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] and death of [[Jesus]] ([[Jim Caviezel]]). The film was shot exclusively in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Latin]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Although Gibson originally intended to release the film without subtitles; he eventually relented for theatrical exhibition. The film sparked divergent reviews, ranging from high praise to criticism of the violence.

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] accused Gibson of [[anti-semitism]] over the film's unflattering depiction of [[Caiaphas]] and the [[Sanhedrin]].

In ''[[The Nation]]'', reviewer [[Katha Pollitt]] said, "Gibson has violated just about every precept of the (United States Conference of Catholic Bishops) conference's own 1988 'Criteria' for the portrayal of Jews in dramatizations of the Passion (no bloodthirsty Jews, no rabble, no use of Scripture that reinforces negative stereotypes of Jews, etc.) ... The priests have big noses and gnarly faces, lumpish bodies, yellow teeth; [[Herod Antipas]] and his court are a bizarre collection of oily-haired, [[epicene]] perverts. The 'good Jews' look like Italian movie stars (Italian sex symbol [[Monica Bellucci]] is [[Mary Magdalene]]); Mary, who would have been around 50 and appeared 70, could pass for a ripe 35."<ref name="pollitt">{{cite news

Among those to defend Gibson were [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] Rabbi [[Daniel Lapin]] and radio personality [[Michael Medved]]. Referring to ADL National Director [[Abraham Foxman]], Rabbi Lapin said that by calling ''The Passion of the Christ'' [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], "what he is saying is that the only way (for Christians) to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate (their own) faith."

In an interview with the ''[[Globe and Mail]]'', Gibson stated, "If anyone has distorted Gospel passages to rationalize cruelty towards Jews or anyone, it's in defiance of repeated Papal condemnation. The [[Papacy]] has condemned [[racism]] in any form... Jesus died for the sins of all times, and I'll be the first on the line for culpability".<ref>{{cite news | title=Mel Gibson Interview | publisher=Globe and Mail|date=February 14, 2004}}</ref>

Eventually, the continued media attacks began to anger Gibson. After his father's Holocaust denial was sharply criticized in print by ''The New York Times'' writer [[Frank Rich]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/03/arts/03RICH.html |title=Mel Gibson's Martyrdom Complex |author=Frank Rich |date=August 3, 2003 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> Gibson retorted, "I want to kill him.

Gibson's [[Traditionalist Catholic]] upbringing was also the target of criticism. In a 2006 interview with [[Diane Sawyer]], Gibson stated that he feels that his "human rights were violated" by the often vitriolic attacks on his person, his family, and his religious beliefs which were sparked by ''The Passion''.<ref name=2004prime />

Gibson himself has stated that the film is an attempt at making a deliberate point about great civilizations and what causes them to decline and disintegrate. Gibson said, "People think that modern man is so enlightened, but we're susceptible to the same forces – and we are also capable of the same heroism and transcendence."<ref name="wildaboutmovies">{{cite web|url=http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/movies/ApocalyptoMovieTrailerPosterMelGibson.php |title=''Apocalypto'' First Look |publisher=WildAboutMovies}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15001985/ |title=Mel Gibson criticizes Iraq war at film fest – Troubled filmmaker draws parallels to collapsing Mayan civilization |agency=Associated Press |date=September 25, 2006 }}</ref> This theme is further explored by a quote from [[Will Durant]], which is superimposed at the very beginning of the film: "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."

In April 2011, Gibson finally broke his silence about the incident in question. In an interview with [[Deadline.com]], Gibson expressed gratitude to longtime friends [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Jodie Foster]], both of whom had spoken publicly in his defense. About the recordings, Gibson said, {{quote|I've never treated anyone badly or in a discriminatory way based on their gender, race, religion or sexuality – period. I don't blame some people for thinking that though, from the garbage they heard on those leaked tapes, which have been edited. You have to put it all in the proper context of being in an irrationally, heated discussion at the height of a breakdown, trying to get out of a really unhealthy relationship. It's one terribly awful moment in time, said to one person, in the span of one day and doesn't represent what I truly believe or how I've treated people my entire life.<ref name="deadline.com" />}}

In the same interview, Gibson stated, {{quote|I was allowed to end the case and still maintain my innocence. It's called a [[Nolo contendere#California|West Plea]]<ref>The People of the State of California v. Dale West, 3 Cal. 3d 595; 477 P.2d 409 (California Supreme Court, 1970)</ref> and it's not something that prosecutors normally allow. But in my case, the prosecutors and the judge agreed that it was the right thing to do. I could have continued to fight this for years and it probably would have come out fine. But I ended it for my children and my family. This was going to be such a circus. You don't drag other people in your life through this sewer needlessly, so I'll take the hit and move on.<ref name="deadline.com" />}}

In August 2011, Gibson settled with Grigorieva and she was awarded $750,000, joint legal custody and a house in Sherman Oaks, California until their three-year-old daughter Lucia turns 18. In 2013, Grigorieva sued her attorneys accusing them of advising her to sign a bad agreement, including one with Gibson that holds her taking legal action against him would compromise her financial settlement.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/18/oksana-grigorieva-mel-gibson_n_2505374.html Oksana Grigorieva, Mel Gibson's Ex-Girlfriend, Suing Her Former Attorneys], [[Huffington Post]], January 18, 2013.</ref>

Gibson questioned the [[Iraq War]] in March 2004.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/18/1079199319258.html "Mel Gibson joins stars to question Iraq war."] ''Sydney Morning Herald''.

In a 2011 interview, Gibson stated:
<blockquote>The whole notion of politics is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why do you have to adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch [[Fox News|Fox]] claw [[CNN]], and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.<ref name="deadline.com"/></blockquote>

===Alcohol abuse and legal issues===
Gibson has said that he started drinking at the age of 13.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21062683-5005961,00.html "Rant aftermath a gift, says Gibson."]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} ''Herald Sun''. January 15, 2007.</ref> In a 2002 interview about his time at [[National Institute of Dramatic Art|NIDA]], Gibson said, "I had really good highs but some very low lows.

Gibson was banned from driving in Ontario for three months in 1984, after rear-ending a car in Toronto while under the influence of alcohol.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mel Gibson talks about Braveheart, movie stardom, and media treachery |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/Issues/1995-05-25/film/film_3.html |author=Seitz, Matt Zoller |work=Dallas Observer |date=May 25, 1995 |accessdate=July 29, 2006}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> He retreated to his Australian farm for over a year to recover, but he continued to struggle with drinking. Despite this problem, Gibson gained a reputation in Hollywood for professionalism and punctuality such that ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'' director [[Richard Donner]] was shocked when Gibson confided that he was drinking five pints of beer for breakfast.<ref name=2004prime /> Reflecting in 2003 and 2004, Gibson said that despair in his mid-30s led him to contemplate suicide, and he meditated on [[Christ's Passion]] to heal his wounds.<ref name=2004prime /><ref name=pboyer /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/02/22/news/index2.html |title=Mel Gibson's Passion |author=Ryan, Tim |work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=February 22, 2004}}</ref> He took more time off acting in 1991 and sought professional help.<ref name="Wright">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/youre-not-a-jew-are-you/2006/08/04/1154198332750.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|title=You're not a Jew, are you?|last=Wright|first=Gerard|date=August 5, 2006|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref> That year, Gibson's attorneys were unsuccessful at blocking the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' from publishing what Gibson shared at [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meetings.<ref>''The Advertiser''.

It's something that's close to me. People do come back from it, and it's a miracle."<ref>Higgins, Bill. ''Los Angeles Times''. December 14, 1992.</ref>

On July 28, 2006, Gibson was arrested for [[driving under the influence]] (DUI) while speeding in his vehicle with an open container of alcohol, which is illegal in much of the [[United States]]. According to a 2011 article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Gibson first told the arresting officer, "My life is over. I'm fucked. Robyn's going to leave me."<ref name="Vanity Fair, March 2011">{{cite web|author=Peter BiskindIllustration by Andr&#233; Carrilho |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2011/03/mel-gibson-201103#gotopage3 |title=Vanity Fair, March 2011 |publisher=Vanityfair.com |accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref> According to the arrest report, Gibson exploded into an angry tirade when the arresting officer would not allow him to drive home. Gibson climaxed with the words, "Fucking Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Are you a Jew?"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/us/30gibson.html | work=The New York Times | title=Mel Gibson Apologizes for Tirade After Arrest | date=July 30, 2006}}</ref><ref name=tmz>[http://www.tmz.com/2006/07/28/gibsons-anti-semitic-tirade-alleged-cover-up/ "Gibson's Anti-Semitic Tirade"].

On August 17, 2006, Gibson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor drunken-driving charge and was sentenced to three years probation.<ref name="first role" /> He was ordered to attend self-help meetings five times a week for four and a half months and three times a week for the remainder of the first year of his probation. He was also ordered to attend a First Offenders Program, was fined $1,300, and his license was restricted for 90 days.<ref name="first role" />

At a May 2007 progress hearing, Gibson was praised for his compliance with the terms of his probation and his extensive participation in a self-help program beyond what was required.<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/5/11/153226.shtml "Mel Gibson Praised for Progress in Alcohol Rehab."] ''Newsmax''. May 12, 2007.</ref>

In October 2011, [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], who has a history of overcoming legal problems and drug addiction, was honored at the 25th [[American Cinematheque]] Awards. Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work. After Gibson's introduction, Downey did not discuss himself but instead explained he had chosen Gibson since he had helped Downey through his hardships. Downey then told the audience: "I humbly ask that you join me, unless you are completely without sin, and in which case you picked the wrong fucking industry, in forgiving my friend of his trespasses and offering him the same clean slate that you have me and allowing him to continue his great and ongoing contribution to our collective art without shame."  After the speech, the two friends hugged onstage to applause.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/10666801-robert-downey-jr-stands-up-for-mel-gibson|title=Robert Downey Jr. Stands Up for Mel Gibson|accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref>

==Controversies==

The [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) accused Gibson of [[homophobia]] after a December 1991 interview in the Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' in which he made derogatory comments about [[homosexual]]s.<ref name="sfbay">Wockner, Rex. [http://www.sfbaytimes.com/index.php?sec=article&article_id=5399 "Mel Gibson, Circa 1992, "Refuses to Apologize to Gays"."] ''San Francisco Bay Times''. August 17, 2006. Quote: Asked what he thought of gay people, he said, "They take it up the ass." Gibson then proceeded to point at his posterior and said: "This is only for taking a shit." When reminded that he had worked closely with gay people at drama school, Gibson said, "They were good people, kind, I like them. But their thing is not my thing." When the interviewer asked if Gibson was afraid that people would think he is gay because he's an actor, Gibson replied, "Do I sound like a homosexual? Do I talk like them? Do I move like them? What happens is when you're an actor, they stick that label on you."</ref><ref name="deangelis" /> Gibson later defended his comments<ref name="sfbay" /> and rejected calls to apologize even as he faced fresh accusations of homophobia in the wake of his film ''Braveheart''.<ref name=pb /> However, Gibson joined GLAAD in hosting 10 [[lesbian]] and gay filmmakers for an on-location seminar on the set of the movie ''[[Conspiracy Theory (film)|Conspiracy Theory]]'' in January 1997.<ref>[http://www.glaad.org/media/archive_detail.php?id=181 "Mel Gibson to Meet Up-and-Coming Lesbian and Gay Filmmakers."]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} glaad.org.</ref> In 1999 when asked about the comments to ''El País'', Gibson said, "I shouldn't have said it, but I was tickling a bit of [[vodka]] during that interview, and the quote came back to bite me on the ass."<ref name="NutTeKoha" />

Gibson's 2004 film ''The Passion of the Christ'' sparked a fierce debate over alleged antisemitic imagery and overtones. Gibson denied that the film was antisemitic, but critics remained divided. Some agreed that the film was consistent with the [[Gospel]]s and traditional Catholic teachings, while others argued that it reflected a selective reading of the Gospels.

In July 2010, it was alleged that Gibson had been recorded during a phone call with Oksana Grigorieva suggesting that if she got "raped by a pack of niggers," she would be to blame.<ref name="guardianjuly2">{{cite news | first = Ed | last = Pilkington | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/jul/02/mel-gibson-racist-rant | title = Mel Gibson faces flak again after alleged racist rant | date = July 2, 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate =July 2, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="telegraphjuly15">{{cite news | last = | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/7891640/Mel-Gibson-threatens-to-burn-house-down-in-new-tape.html | title = Mel Gibson 'threatens to burn house down in new tape' | date = July 15, 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | accessdate =July 15, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="hitting">{{cite news | first = Anthony | last = McCartney | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/12/AR2010071202673.html | title = Gibson tape mentions alleged hitting of girlfriend | date = July 12, 2010 | agency=Associated Press | publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate =July 12, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/07/world-exclusive-audio-mel-gibsons-explosive-racist-rant-listen-it-here |title=Original Internet posting of Gibson's alleged words |publisher=Radaronline.com|date=July 12, 2010|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref> Gibson was barred from coming near Grigorieva or her daughter due to a [[domestic violence]]-related [[restraining order]].<ref name="guardianjuly2" /> The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department launched a domestic violence investigation against Gibson,<ref name="abuseinvestigation2" /> later dropped when Gibson pled no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge.<ref name=nocontest/>
