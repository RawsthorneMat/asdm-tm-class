==Personal life==
Chow was born in [[Lamma Island]], [[Hong Kong]] to a mother who was a cleaning lady and vegetable farmer, and a father who worked on a [[Shell Oil Company]] tanker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/2/Yun-Quite-Chow.html |title=Yun-Fat Chow Biography (1955-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&p_theme=kc&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF46E2D345CD11&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=A man of melodrama: Action films made Chow Slightly-Fat famous, but 'The Corruptor' star says he's an actor |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}</ref> Of [[Hakka people|Hakka]] origins,<ref>{{cite web | title = Honorary Doctor of Letters - Mr CHOW Yun-fat | url=https://www.cityu.edu.hk/cityu/about/honorary/doc/chow-en.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title =Martial parts	|first=Jim|last=Slotek|work=[[Jam!|Jam.canoe.ca]]|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/Y/Yun_Fat_Chow/2003/04/13/762802.html }}</ref> he grew up in a farming community on [[Lamma Island]] in a house with no electricity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-100226992.html |title=Film chat: Chow Yun-Fat - Chowing the Fat; How Eastern hero Chow Not-Fat came to hold the West hostage.

At seventeen, he left school to help support the family by doing odd jobs including bellboy,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/travel/articles/2007/07/15/hong_kong_feels_like_a_movie_set_because_it_is/ |title='&#39;The Boston Globe'&#39;: "Hong Kong feels like a movie set because it is", July 15, 2007 |publisher=Boston.com |date=2007-07-15 |accessdate=2010-09-23 | first=Rory | last=Boland}}</ref> postman, camera salesman and taxi driver. His life started to change when he responded to a newspaper advertisement and his actor-trainee application was accepted by [[TVB]], the local [[television station]]. He signed a three-year contract with the studio and made his acting debut. Chow became a heartthrob and a familiar face in soap operas that were exported internationally.

Chow has been married twice; first in 1983, to [[Candice Yu]], an actress from [[Asia Television]]; the marriage lasted nine months. In 1986, Chow married Singaporean [[Charaine Zheng]]. The couple have no children, although Chow has a goddaughter, Celine Ng, a former child model for Chickeeduck, McDonald's, Toys'R'Us and other companies.

==Career==
When Chow appeared in the 1980 TV series ''[[The Bund (TV series)|The Bund]]'' on [[TVB]], it did not take long for him to become a household name in Hong Kong. The series, about the rise and fall of a gangster in 1930s [[Shanghai]], was a hit throughout Asia and made Chow a star.

Although Chow continued his TV success, his goal was to become a big-screen actor. However, his occasional ventures into low-budget films were disastrous. Success finally came when he teamed up with director [[John Woo]] in the 1986 gangster action-melodrama ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'', which swept the box offices in Asia and established Chow and Woo as megastars. ''A Better Tomorrow'' won him his first Best Actor award at the Hong Kong Film Awards. It was the highest grossing film in Hong Kong history at the time, and set a new standard for Hong Kong gangster films. Taking the opportunity, Chow quit TV entirely. With his new image from ''A Better Tomorrow'', he made many more '[[gun fu]]' or '[[heroic bloodshed]]' films, such as ''[[A Better Tomorrow 2]]'' (1987), ''[[Prison on Fire]]'', ''[[Prison on Fire II]]'', ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'' (1989), ''[[A Better Tomorrow 3]]'' (1990), ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' (1992) and ''[[City on Fire (1987 film)|City on Fire]]’', an inspiration for [[Quentin Tarantino|Quentin Tarantino's]] ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''.

Chow may be best known for playing honorable tough guys, whether cops or criminals, but he has also starred in comedies like ''Diary of a Big Man'' (1988) and ''[[Now You See Love, Now You Don't]]'' (1992) and romantic blockbusters such as ''[[Love in a Fallen City (film)|Love in a Fallen City]]'' (1984) and ''[[An Autumn's Tale]]'' (1987), for which he was named best actor at the [[Golden Horse Awards]]. He brought together his disparate personae in the 1989 film ''[[God of Gamblers]]'' (''Du Shen''), directed by the prolific [[Wong Jing]], in which he was by turns suave charmer, a broad comedian and an action hero. The film surprised many, became immensely popular, broke Hong Kong's all-time box office record, and spawned a series of gambling films as well as several comic sequels starring [[Andy Lau]] and [[Stephen Chow]].  The often tough demeanor and youthful appearance of Chow Yun-Fat's characters has earned him the nickname "Babyface Killer".

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' proclaimed Chow Yun-Fat "the coolest actor in the world."<ref>{{cite news |title=the coolest actor in the world : In This Country, Chow Yun-fat Is Only a Cult Figure. But the Hong Kong Action Star Has a Global Audience That Has Made His Movies International Blockbusters.

His first two films, ''[[The Replacement Killers]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Corruptor]]'' (1999), were box office disappointments. In his next film ''[[Anna and the King]]'' (1999), Chow teamed up with [[Jodie Foster]], but the film suffered at the box office. Chow accepted the role of Li Mu-Bai in the (2000) film ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]].'' It became a winner at both the international box office and the [[Oscars]]. In 2003, Chow came back to Hollywood and starred in ''[[Bulletproof Monk]]''. In 2006, he teamed up with [[Gong Li]] in the film, ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]],'' directed by [[Zhang Yimou]].

In 2007, Chow was cast as the pirate captain [[Sao Feng]] in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''. However, his part was omitted when the movie was shown in [[mainland China]], where government censors felt that Chow's character "vilified and humiliated" Chinese people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-06-18/chows-pirates-scenes-cut-in-china/71638|title=Chow's 'Pirates' scenes cut in China|date= 17 Jun 2007|work=Abc.net.au}}</ref>

In the poorly received film ''[[Dragonball Evolution]]'', Chow Yun-fat played Master Roshi.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/04/11/movies/11drag.html| title = Possess Glittery Magic Orb, Do Martial Arts, Save World| last = Lee | first = Nathan| work = [[The New York Times]]| date = April 10, 2009}}</ref>

In 2014, Chow returned to Hong Kong cinema in "[[From Vegas to Macau]]".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://hk.movies.yahoo.net/movie/details/22489-%E8%B3%AD%E5%9F%8E%E9%A2%A8%E9%9B%B2|work=Yahoo.net|title=From Vegas to Macau}}</ref> For the part, he lost 13&nbsp;kg within 10 months.<ref>{{ cite web | url= http://ent.takungpao.com.hk/star/q/2014/0125/2241708.html | title = 周潤發公開減肥秘訣 10個月激減13公斤 I last = 張 I first = 潔 | work = 信息時報 | date = 2014-01-25}}</ref> 

In October 2014, Chow supported the [[Umbrella Movement]], a civil rights movement for universal suffrage in Hong Kong. His political stance eventually resulted in censorship by the Chinese government.<ref>{{ cite web | url= http://www.ntdtv.com/xtr/b5/2014/10/28/a1149517.html | title=Ntdtv.com| date = 2014-10-28}}</ref>

In February 2015, Chow reprised his role as Ken in the sequel ''[[From Vegas to Macau II]]''. He was paid 5 million USD (39 million HKD) for the film.<ref>{{ cite web | url= http://www.jaynestars.com/news/chow-yun-fat-louis-koo-chilam-cheung-digging-gold-mines | title = Chow Yun Fat, Louis Koo, Chilam Cheung Digging Gold Mines | work = JayneStars.com | date = 2014-12-26}}</ref>

==Book==
On June 26, 2008, Chow released his first [[photo]] collection in [[Hong Kong]], which includes pictures taken on the sets of his films. Proceeds from the book's sales were donated to [[Sichuan earthquake]] victims. Published by [[Louis Vuitton]], the books were sold in [[Vuitton]]'s Hong Kong and Paris stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/103489/Crouching-Tiger-actor-launches-book-for-benefit-of-Chinese-earthquake-victims |publisher=gmanews.tv |title=Crouching Tiger actor launches book for benefit of Chinese earthquake victims |publisher=Gmanews.tv |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref><ref>[http://www.pr-inside.com/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon-star-r664705.htm PR-inside.com| 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' star Chow Yun-fat publishes photo collection]</ref>
