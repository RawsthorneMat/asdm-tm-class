Johnson directed ''[[The Brothers Bloom]]'' (2008) and ''[[Looper (film)|Looper]]'' (2012), as well as three episodes of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' ("[[Fly (Breaking Bad)|Fly]]", "[[Fifty-One]]", and "[[Ozymandias (Breaking Bad)|Ozymandias]]").

In June 2014, it was reported that Johnson had signed to write a treatment for ''[[Star Wars Episode IX]]''. In March 2015, it was confirmed that Johnson would write and direct ''[[Star Wars Episode VIII]]''.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in [[Maryland]]. He was raised in [[San Clemente, California]], and attended [[San Clemente High School (San Clemente, California)|San Clemente High School]], where ''[[Brick (film)|Brick]]'' was predominantly filmed. He then attended the [[University of Southern California]] and graduated from the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] in 1996.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Johnson's first short film, ''[[Evil Demon Golfball from Hell!!!]]'', which is loosely based on [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]", was included as an easter egg on the [[Looper (film)|Looper]] Blu-ray.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/7924/looper.html |title=Blu-ray.com |publisher=Bluray.highdefdigest.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>

==Career==
Johnson's film career, as told to [[Robert K. Elder]], author of ''[[The Film That Changed My Life]]'', was largely inspired by ''[[Annie Hall]]'', a film that he said "broke so many rules in terms of film narrative". He stated: "It moved me in a way that very few other films have moved me. That's something that, I pray to God, if I am able to keep making movies, I can only hope, twenty years down the line maybe, I'll be able to approach."<ref>Johnson, Rian. Interview by Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life. By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p17. Print.</ref>

His debut film, made for just under $500,000, ''[[Brick (film)|Brick]]'' is a crime drama. Johnson has often said that he looked to the novels of [[Dashiell Hammett]] as inspiration for the film's unique use of language. While the film is classified as a [[film noir]], Johnson claims that no references were made to film noir during production, so as to focus the production away from reproducing a genre piece. ''Brick'' was released on DVD by [[Focus Features]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Joseph Gordon-Levitt Is a Teenage Bogart at Noir High in 'Brick'|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/movies/31bric.html|accessdate=October 10, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 31, 2006|author=Stephen Holden}}</ref>

Johnson directed the video for [[The Mountain Goats]]' song "Woke Up New" in 2006. He is a professed fan of the band, and was asked to direct the video when bandleader [[John Darnielle]] noticed a reference to them in the credits for ''Brick''. A song is credited to "The Hospital Bombers Experience", which is a reference to the Mountain Goats song titled "The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton". Johnson also directed a live performance film of the Mountain Goats' 2009 album ''The Life of the World to Come''. The film consists of a single shot, depicting Darnielle performing the entire album on guitar and piano with minimal accompaniment. This film was screened in New York City, Chicago, Seattle, and Portland, Oregon upon its completion, and was released as a limited edition DVD on [[Record Store Day]] (April 17, 2010).

Johnson's second film, ''[[The Brothers Bloom]]'', is a con-man story released in theaters in May 2009, and later on DVD by [[Summit Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite news|title=My Brother, My Partner in Crime|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/05/15/movies/15bloo.html|accessdate=October 10, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 14, 2009|author=Stephen Holden}}</ref>

Johnson's third film, ''[[Looper (film)|Looper]]'', began shooting in [[Louisiana]] on January 24, 2011 and was released on September 28, 2012 by [[TriStar Pictures]] and [[FilmDistrict]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loopermovie.tumblr.com/post/2908571344/day-one-shot-one |title=Official Looper production blog}}</ref> Set in the near future, it has been described as dark science fiction, and involves hitmen whose victims are sent from the future.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chud.com/articles/articles/19420/1/RIAN-JOHNSON-LETS-SLIP-A-FEW-MORE-DETAILS-ABOUT-LOOPER/Page1.html |title=Rian Johnson lets slip a few more details about Looper |author= Fischer, Russ |date=May 13, 2009 |work=Chud.com |accessdate=May 18, 2009}}</ref> The film opened the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]]<ref name="OpeningFilm">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18967125 |title=Looper to launch Toronto film festival |accessdate=July 25, 2012|work=BBC News}}</ref> and the 2012 [[Palo Alto International Film Festival]].<ref name="PAIFF">{{cite web|url=http://paiff.net/pdf/press/8-16-12.pdf|title=PALO ALTO INT'L FILM FESTIVAL RETURNS SEPT. 27–30 2012|accessdate=September 4, 2012|work=Palo Alto International Film Festival}}</ref> ''Looper'' was a surprise success at the box office.

Johnson has made a number of short films, some of which are available on his website. His short film from high school titled ''Ninja Ko'' is available as an [[easter egg (virtual)|easter egg]] on the ''Brick'' DVD. The ''Brothers Bloom'' DVD features a short, [[Buster Keaton]]-esque silent film he made in college. After working with [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] on ''Brick'', the two shot a short film in [[Paris, France]] titled ''Escargots''. In 2002, he directed a short film titled ''The Psychology of Dream Analysis'', which is available to view on his Vimeo account.<ref>{{cite web|author=from rcjohnso Plus 5 years ago Not Yet Rated |url=http://vimeo.com/1559454 |title=Vimeo.com |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2008-08-19 |accessdate=2014-03-05}}</ref>
