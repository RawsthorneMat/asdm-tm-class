==Career==

===Early career in journalism===
He first worked as a director in the 1980s, for the [[ITV Network|ITV]] [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] programme ''[[World in Action]]''; his investigation of timber-framed house construction has been cited as preventing its widespread adoption in England.<ref>{{cite web|title=The timber-frame two and the wild, wild net|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/the-timber-frame-two-and-the-wild-wild-net/141010.article|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref> At the same time he co-authored the notorious book ''[[Spycatcher]]'' with [[Peter Wright]], former assistant director of [[MI5]], which contained enough sensitive information that the [[British Government]] made an unsuccessful attempt to ban it.<ref>{{cite news | author=Thorpe Vanessa | title=Hollywood's Favourite Brit | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2141993,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=5 August 2007 | accessdate=2009-02-16 | location=London}}</ref>

===Film===
[[File:Bloody Sunday movie poster.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Bloody Sunday (film)|Bloody Sunday]]]]
;Early films
He then moved into drama, directing non-fiction made-for-television films such as ''[[The One That Got Away (1996 film)|The One That Got Away]]'', based on [[Chris Ryan]]'s book about [[Special Air Service|SAS]] actions in the [[Gulf War]] and [[The Fix (TV film)|''The Fix'']], based on the story of the [[1964 British betting scandal|betting scandal]] which shook British football in 1964.

His 1998 film ''[[The Theory of Flight]]'' starred [[Kenneth Branagh]] and [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who played a woman with motor neurone disease. The film dealt with the difficult issue of the sexuality of people with disabilities.

Greengrass co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[Omagh (film)|Omagh]]'', which depicted the 1998 [[Omagh bombing|bombing]] of [[Omagh]] and directed ''The Murder of Stephen Lawrence'' (1999), which told the story of [[Stephen Lawrence]], a black youth whose murder was not properly investigated by the [[Metropolitan Police]], and his mother's investigations, which led to accusations about [[institutional racism]] in the police.

;''[[Bloody Sunday (film)|Bloody Sunday]]''
''[[Bloody Sunday (film)|Bloody Sunday]]'' (2002), depicted the 1972 [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] [[shooting]]s of [[Irish people|Irish]] anti-[[internment]] activists by British soldiers in an almost documentary style; it shared First Prize at the 2002 [[Berlin Film Festival]] with [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Spirited Away]]''. ''Bloody Sunday'' was inspired by Don Mullan's politically influential book ''Eyewitness Bloody Sunday'' (Wolfhound Press, 1997). Mullan was a schoolboy witness of the events of Bloody Sunday. The book is credited as a major catalyst in the establishment of the new [[Bloody Sunday Inquiry]] chaired by [[Mark Saville, Baron Saville of Newdigate|Lord Saville]]. The inquiry, the longest running and most expensive in British legal history, led to an historic apology by [[Prime Minister of the UK|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] on 15 June 2010. Mullan was co-producer and actor in ''Bloody Sunday''.

;''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]''
Based on that film, Greengrass was hired to direct 2004's ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]'', a sequel to the 2002 film ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'', after the first film's director, [[Doug Liman]], left the project. The film starred [[Matt Damon]] as [[Jason Bourne]], an amnesiac who realises he was once a top [[CIA]] assassin and is now being pursued by his former employers. It proved to be an unexpectedly enormous financial and critical success, and secured Greengrass's reputation and ability to get his smaller, more personal films made.
[[File:United93.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]]]
;''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]''
In 2006, Greengrass directed ''[[United 93 (film)|United 93]]'', a film based on the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|11 September 2001]] hijacking of [[United Airlines Flight 93]].  The film received immense critical acclaim, particularly for Greengrass' again quasi-documentary-style directing. After receiving many Best Director awards and nominations from critics' circles (including the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]]), Greengrass won the [[BAFTA]] award for [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]] at the [[60th British Academy Film Awards]] and received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Achievement in Directing]] at the [[79th Academy Awards]]. For his role in writing the film, he earned the [[Writers Guild of America]] Award and BAFTA nominations for Best Original Screenplay.

;''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]''
He followed this with a return to the Bourne franchise. ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum (film)|The Bourne Ultimatum]]'', released in 2007, was an even bigger success than the previous two films and provided him with yet another BAFTA nomination for [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction|Best Director]] at the [[61st British Academy Film Awards]].

;''[[Green Zone (film)|Green Zone]]''
''Green Zone'' stars [[Matt Damon]] as the head of a U.S. military team on an unsuccessful hunt for [[weapons of mass destruction]] in [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|post-war Iraq]]. It was filmed in [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]] and released in 2010.<ref>{{cite news | author=Diane Garrett | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117966380.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Damon, Greengrass re-teaming | work=Variety | date=6 June 2007 | accessdate=2008-01-22 }}</ref> The film was first announced as being based on the bestselling, award-winning non-fiction book ''[[Imperial Life in the Emerald City]]'', by the [[Washington Post]]'s Baghdad bureau chief, [[Rajiv Chandrasekaran]]. However the final film is a largely fictionalized action thriller only loosely inspired by events in the book.
[[File:Captain Phillips Poster.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Captain Phillips (film)|Captain Phillips]]]]
;''[[Captain Phillips (film)|Captain Phillips]]''
''Captain Phillips'', Greengrass's film about the [[Maersk Alabama hijacking]] in 2009, was based on the book ''[[A Captain's Duty]]'', and starred [[Tom Hanks]], [[Barkhad Abdi]] and [[Faysal Ahmed]]. It was shot in the summer of 2012 in [[Massachusetts]], [[Virginia]] and [[Malta]] and was released on 11 October 2013.<ref>{{IMDb title|1535109|Captain Phillips}}</ref>

===Future projects===
;''The Fear Index''
He is next set to direct an adaptation of [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]'s bestselling novel ''[[The Fear Index]]'', a thriller centring on the connection of a fictional [[Geneva]] hedge fund to the [[2010 Flash Crash]]. The film will be produced by [[Twentieth Century Fox]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Greengrass In ‘Fear Index,’ Robert Zemeckis Out Of ‘Replay’ As He Takes ‘Flight’ With Denzel Washington|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/paul-greengrass-in-fear-index-robert-zemeckis-out-of-replay-as-he-takes-flight-with-denzel-washington/|publisher=Deadline}}</ref>

It was announced in late July 2013 that Greengrass was in final talks to direct [[Aaron Sorkin]]'s script about the [[Chicago Seven]], a project to which [[Steven Spielberg]] had been attached.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/paul-greengrass-talks-aaron-sorkin-590983|title=Paul Greengrass in Talks for Aaron Sorkin-Penned 'The Trial of the Chicago 7'|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|date=23 July 2013}}</ref>

;''Bourne 5''
[[Universal Pictures]] stated at a media conference in [[Los Angeles]], that they are likely to release more ''Bourne'' films, despite ''The Bourne Legacy'' being given mixed reviews by critics.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19597043 Universal Pictures say they will make more bourne films: BBC News]</ref> In a December 2012 interview, [[Matt Damon]] has revealed that he and Greengrass are interested in returning for the next film as Jason Bourne and the director respectively. Damon is reported stating that although he had not seen ''Legacy'', he intends to do so because not only is he curious to see it, but also because he has enjoyed [[Jeremy Renner]] in everything he has seen him in. Damon does however believe that if he is to return for the next film, Renner would not likely be in it too and would not have Bourne and Cross joining forces and working together.<ref>http://movies.msn.com/movies/article.aspx?news=780494&ocid=rr-mov-news</ref> On 21 February 2013 it was confirmed that a Bourne 5 was being planned.<ref>[http://screenrant.com/bourne-5-snow-white-huntsman-sequel-fifty-shades-grey-movie-release-date-2014/ Bourne 5 and Snow White Sequel Updates; Fifty Shades of Grey in Summer 2014?]</ref><ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=36574 Universal Boss Talks Up Bourne 5]</ref> On 2 August 2013, Universal has hired [[Tony Gilroy]] to pen the film's script and Renner will be returning as Cross.<ref>[http://deadline.com/2013/08/new-bourne-chapter-in-works-at-universal-for-jeremy-renners-aaron-cross-character/ New ‘Bourne’ Chapter In Works At Universal For Jeremy Renner’s Aaron Cross Character]</ref>
On 10 October 2014 it was confirmed by Matt Damon that he is returning for the fifth Jason Bourne movie with Paul Greengrass in the directors seat. In a statement Matt Damon said that "It'll be in 2016 when the movie will actually come out. [Director] Paul Greengrass is going to do another one and that's all I ever said. I just needed him to say yes".<ref>[http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Matt-Damon-Jason-Bourne-Again-Here-Details-68124.html]</ref>

;''1984''
[[Sony Pictures]] has announced that Greengrass will be the director of an upcoming version of the [[George Orwell]] novel [[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]].  James Graham will write the screenplay.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/films/paul-greengrass-to-direct-1984-adaptation | title=Paul Greengrass To Direct 1984 Adaptation | accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref>

===Directors UK===
In June 2008, he was one of many British directors to set up [[Directors UK]] and is currently the president of the board.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.directors.uk.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=9 |title=Paul Greengrass - President |work=[[Directors UK]] |accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/inside-story-in-the-right-direction--the-cream-of-britains-television-directing-talent-848048.html |title=Inside Story: In the right direction - the cream of Britain's television directing talent |work=[[The Independent]] |date=16 June 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}</ref>

===Unmade projects===
Greengrass was initially attached to direct the film adaptation of ''[[Watchmen]]''. Greengrass's version was not set in the alternate 1980s of the graphic novel, but in the modern world. However the production was shut down a few weeks before filming was due to start and the eventual ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' film, far closer to the graphic novel, was directed by [[Zack Snyder]].
