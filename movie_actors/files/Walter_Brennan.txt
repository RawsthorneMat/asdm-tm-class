'''Walter Andrew Brennan''' (July 25, 1894&nbsp;– September 21, 1974) was an American actor.<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', September 25, 1974.</ref> Brennan is one of three men to win three acting [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] (the other two being [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]), having won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] in 1936, 1938 and 1940.

==Early life==
Walter Andrew Brennan was born in [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], less than two miles from his family's home in [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]].<ref name="ReferenceA">World War I Draft Records, Essex County, Massachusetts; Roll: 1684678; Draft Board: 24.</ref> He was the second of three children born to [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants William John Brennan and Margaret Elizabeth Flanagan. The elder Brennan was an engineer and inventor and young Walter studied [[engineering]] at [[Cambridge Rindge and Latin School|Rindge Technical High School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

While in school, Brennan became interested in acting and began to perform in [[vaudeville]] at the age of fifteen. While working as a bank clerk, he enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]] and served as a private with the [[101st Field Artillery Regiment]] in [[France]] during [[World War I]].<ref name="ReferenceA" /><ref>[http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/research/r_a_bren.html WALTER BRENNAN PAPERS, 1895-1974], Donald C. & Elizabeth M. Dickinson Research Center, [[National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum]]</ref>  Following the war, he moved to [[Guatemala]] and raised [[pineapple]]s before settling in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]]. During the 1920s, he made a fortune in the [[real estate]] market, but he lost most of his money during the [[Great Depression]].

==Career==
Finding himself broke, he began taking extra parts in 1925 and then bit parts in as many films as he could, including ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933), the Three Stooges short ''[[Woman Haters]]'' (1934), and ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), in which he enjoyed a brief speaking part, and also worked as a stunt man. In the 1930s, he began appearing in higher-quality films and received more substantial roles as his talent was recognized. This culminated with his receiving the very first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role as Swan Bostrom in the period film ''[[Come and Get It (film)|Come and Get It]]'' (1936). Two years later he portrayed town drunk and accused murderer Muff Potter in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938 film)|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]''.

Throughout his career, Brennan was frequently called upon to play characters considerably older than he was in real life. The loss of many teeth in a 1932 accident, rapidly thinning hair, thin build, and unusual vocal intonations all made him seem older than he really was. He used these features to great effect. In many of his film roles, Brennan wore dentures; in ''[[Northwest Passage (film)|Northwest Passage]]'' — a film set in the late 18th century—he wore a special dental prosthesis which made him appear to have rotting and broken teeth.

For director [[Jean Renoir]]'s first American film, Brennan played the top-billed lead in ''[[Swamp Water]]'' (1941), a drama also featuring [[Walter Huston]] and starring Dana Andrews.
[[File:Walter brennan affairs of cappy ricks ss3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Brennan in ''[[Affairs of Cappy Ricks]]'']]
In ''[[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]]'' (also 1941), he played a sympathetic preacher and dry goods store owner who advised the title character, played by [[Gary Cooper]]. Brennan and Cooper appeared in six films together. In 1942 he played reporter Sam Blake who befriended and encouraged [[Lou Gehrig]] (also played by Cooper) in ''[[Pride of the Yankees]]''. He was particularly skilled in playing the sidekick to the protagonist or as the "grumpy old man" in films like ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' (1944), the [[Humphrey Bogart]] vehicle which introduced [[Lauren Bacall]]. Though he was hardly ever cast as the villain, notable exceptions were his roles as [[Judge Roy Bean]] in ''[[The Westerner (film)|The Westerner]]'' (1940) with Gary Cooper, for which he won his third best supporting actor Academy Award, 'Old Man' Clanton in ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946) opposite [[Henry Fonda]], and the [[Cinerama]] production ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962) as the murderous Colonel Jeb Hawkins in the [[James Stewart]] episode.

From 1957&ndash;1963, he starred in the popular [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television series]] ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', a [[situation comedy]] about a poor [[West Virginia]] family that relocated to a farm in southern California. After five years on ABC, ''The Real McCoys'' switched to [[CBS]] for a final season. Brennan joined with the series creator, [[Irving Pincus]], to form Brennan-Westgate Productions. The series was co-produced with Danny Thomas's Marterto Productions, and also featured [[Richard Crenna]], [[Kathleen Nolan]], [[Lydia Reed]], and [[Michael Winkelman]]. In morning CBS reruns from 1962–66, the series was re-titled: "The McCoys." "The Real McCoys" can currently (2014) be seen on the COZI cable television network.

Brennan appeared in several other movies and television programs, usually as an eccentric "old timer" or "prospector". Prior to the launching of ''The Real McCoys,'' Brennan appeared as himself as a musical judge in the 1953-1954 ABC series ''[[Jukebox Jury]]''. On May 30, 1957, he guest starred on NBC's ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/MusicVariety/TennesseeErnieFordShow.htm|title=The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=November 25, 2010}}</ref> He also made a few recordings, the most popular being "[[Old Rivers]]" about an eccentric but much-beloved farmer; it was released as a single in 1962 by Liberty Records with "The Epic Ride Of [[John H. Glenn]]" on the flip side, and peaked at number 5 in the U.S. [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts. In his music, Brennan sometimes worked with [[Allen "Puddler" Harris]], a [[Louisiana]] native who was a member of the original [[Ricky Nelson]] Band. He appeared as an extremely cantankerous [[sidekick]] with [[John Wayne]] and [[Dean Martin]] in [[Howard Hawks]]' 1959 western ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' and also co-starred with [[James Garner]] a decade later in ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', playing the head of the Danby Family.

Brennan starred as wealthy executive Walter Andrews, derived from his real name, in the short-lived 1964&ndash;1965 ABC series ''[[The Tycoon (TV series)|The Tycoon]]'', with [[Van Williams]]. In 1967, he starred in another ABC series, ''[[The Guns of Will Sonnett]]'' as an older man in search of his gunfighter son, James Sonnett, with his grandson, Jeff, played by [[Dack Rambo]]. After the series went off the air in 1969, Brennan continued working in both television and feature films. He received top billing over [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]] in the [[TV-movie]] ''[[The Over-the-Hill Gang]]'' (1969) and [[Fred Astaire]] in ''[[The Over-the-Hill Gang Rides Again]]'' the following year. From 1970 to 1971, he was a regular on the CBS sitcom ''[[To Rome with Love (TV series)|To Rome with Love]]'', with [[John Forsythe]]. This was Brennan's last television program as a member of the permanent cast.

==Legacy==
Film historians and critics have long regarded Brennan as one of the finest [[character actors]] in motion picture history. While the roles he was adept at playing were extremely diverse, he is probably best remembered for his portrayals in movie [[Western (genre)|westerns]], such as Judge Roy Bean in ''The Westerner'',  trail hand Nadine Groot in ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' and Deputy Stumpy in ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'', the last two directed by [[Howard Hawks]]. He was the first actor to win three [[Academy Awards]] and remains the only person to have won three [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] awards. However, even he remained somewhat embarrassed as to how he won the awards. In the early years of the Academy Awards, extras were given the right to vote. Brennan was extremely popular with the Union of Film Extras, and since their numbers were overwhelming, he won each time he was nominated. Though he was never thought undeserving of these awards, his third win led to the disenfranchisement of the Extras Union from Oscar voting.

In all, he would appear in more than 230 film and television roles during a career that spanned nearly five decades. For his contributions to the television industry, Walter Brennan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6501 Hollywood Blvd. In 1970, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], where his photograph hangs prominently.

==Private life==
Brennan was married to the former Ruth Wells (December 8, 1897&nbsp;– January 12, 1997),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi?lastname=Brennan&firstname=Ruth&start=101 |title=Social Security Death Index |publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry |accessdate=2009-10-26}}</ref> whom he married in 1920. The Brennans had a daughter, Ruth Caroline, and two sons, Arthur 'Mike' and Andy.

Brennan bought the 12,000-acre Lightning Creek Ranch 20 miles south of [[Joseph, Oregon]], in 1940. Brennan built the Indian Lodge Motel, a movie theater and a variety store in Joseph, and continued going there between film roles until his death in 1974 at age 80. Some of Brennan's family continue to live in the area.

Brennan was politically [[Conservatism|conservative]]. In 1963 and 1964, Brennan joined fellow actors [[William Lundigan]], [[Chill Wills]], and [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]] in making appearances on behalf of [[U.S. Senator]] [[Barry M. Goldwater]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[nominee]] in the campaign against [[U.S. President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ashbrook.org/articles/hartz-draftgoldwater.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010303213814/http://www.ashbrook.org/articles/hartz-draftgoldwater.html |archivedate=2001-03-03 |title=The Impact of the Draft Goldwater Committee on the Republican Party |publisher=ashbrook.org(archive.org) |accessdate=2013-08-24}}</ref>

In 1964, Brennan spoke at "Project Prayer" rally attended by 2,500 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The gathering, which was hosted by [[Anthony Eisley]], a star of the former ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'' series on ABC, sought to flood the [[United States Congress]] with letters in support of [[school prayer]], following two decisions in 1962 and 1963 of the [[United States Supreme Court]] which struck down the practice of enforced prayer in public schools as in conflict with the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=pearson>{{cite web |url=http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/50658/b18f14-0514zdisplay.pdf |format=PDF |title="The Washington Merry-Go-Round", Drew Pearson column, May 14, 1964 |publisher=dspace.wrlc.org |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-02-10}}</ref>

Joining Brennan and Eisley at the rally were [[Rhonda Fleming]], [[Lloyd Nolan]], [[Dale Evans]], [[Pat Boone]], and [[Gloria Swanson]]. Brennan, a Roman Catholic, did not publicize his own religious affiliation, declared, "I'm too old not to be a religious fella. ... It appears we are losing something a lot of people made a lot of sacrifices for."<ref name=pearson/>

During the 1960s he became convinced that the anti-war and civil rights movements were being aided by overseas [[Communists]] from  [[Soviet Union]] through their support of  local, homegrown communist sympathizers and agitators, and said as much in interviews.<ref name="allmovie">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/8313/Walter-Brennan/biography |title=Walter Brennan: Biography |first=Bruce |last=Eder |publisher=All Movie |date=2015 |accessdate=April 15, 2015}}</ref> He told reporters that he believed the civil rights movement—in particular, the riots in places like [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] and demonstrations in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]—had been the result of otherwise content "[[Negroes]]" being stirred up by a small number of "troublemakers" with anti-American agendas.<ref name="allmovie"/> He reportedly expressed glee on the set of his final series ''[[The Guns of Will Sonnett]]'' upon hearing the news that [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], had been assassinated.<ref name="allmovie"/> In 1972, he supported the presidential campaign of conservative California Congressman [[John Schmitz]] over that of [[Richard Nixon]], whom he believed was too moderate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/21833%7C153238/Walter-Brennan/ |title=Walter Brennan |website=Turner Classic Movies |publisher=Turner Entertainment Networks, Inc. |date=2015 |accessdate=April 15, 2015}}</ref>

==Death==
Upon his death from [[emphysema]] at the age of 80 in [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]] in [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]],<ref>Chawkins, Steve (October 8, 1999) [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/08/local/me-19944 "Camarillo Decides on the 'Real McCoy'"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref> Brennan's remains were interred at [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.
