On a [[Channel 4]] trailer that aired in the UK, Holloway stated "I do enjoy my beer," and opined that the greatest invention of all time was "distilled alcohol," while his ''Lost'' colleagues selected "pen and paper," "the wheel," and "the guitar."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWYrssuKLTE|title=Celeb Best Inventions|publisher=YouTube|date=2006-11-22|accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref>
