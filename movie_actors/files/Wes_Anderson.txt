He graduated from [[St. John's School (Texas)|St. John's School]] in Houston in 1987, which he later used as a prominent location throughout ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Tour Wes Anderson's High School AKA the Set of Rushmore | url = http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/06/tour-wes-andersons-high-school-aka-the-set-of-rushmore/258752/ | publisher = The Atlantic | accessdate = October 18, 2013}}</ref> As a child, Anderson made silent films on his father's [[Super 8 film cameras|Super 8 camera]], starring his brothers and friends, although his first ambition was to be a writer.<ref name="telegraph2014"/><ref name="wildwildwes"/> Anderson attended college while working part-time as a cinema projectionist.

==Film career==
Anderson's first film, ''[[Bottle Rocket]]'' (1996), based on a short film that he made with [[Luke Wilson|Luke]] and [[Owen Wilson]], was a crime caper focused on a group of young Texans aspiring to achieve major heists. Though well reviewed, it performed poorly at the box office.<ref name = "Mojo">{{cite web| title = Bottle Rocket| publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]]| url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bottlerocket.htm| accessdate = August 7, 2007}}</ref><ref name=rtbottle>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bottle_rocket/ |title=Bottle Rocket |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.empireonline.com/features/wes-anderson|title= Film By Film: Wes Anderson On Wes Anderson|date=March 2014|work=Empire Magazine|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>

Anderson's next film, ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'' (1998), a quirky comedy about a high school student's crush on an elementary school teacher, starring [[Bill Murray]] and [[Jason Schwartzman]], was a critical success.<ref name=rtrushmore>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rushmore/ |title=Rushmore |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref> Murray has since appeared in every Anderson film to date. In 2000, filmmaker [[Martin Scorsese]] praised ''Bottle Rocket'' and ''Rushmore''.<ref name = "Martin Scorsese">{{cite web | last = Scorsese | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Scorsese | title = Wes Anderson | url = http://www.esquire.com/features/wes-anderson-0300 | publisher = Esquire | date=March 2000 | accessdate = July 31, 2011}}</ref>

''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'' (2001), Anderson's next comedy-drama film about a successful artistic New York City family and its ostracized patriarch, represented Anderson's greatest success until ''[[Moonrise Kingdom]]'' in 2012. Earning more than $50 million in domestic box office receipts, the film was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] and ranked by an ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' poll as the 159th greatest film ever made.<ref>{{cite web | title = EMPIRE's 500 Greatest Movies of All Time | url = http://www.empireonline.com/500/ | publisher = EMPIRE | accessdate = July 5, 2012}}</ref>

Anderson's next feature, ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]'' (2004), about a [[Jacques Cousteau]]-esque documentary filmmaker played by Bill Murray, serves as a classic example of Anderson's style but its critical reception was less favorable than his previous films and its box office did not match the heights of ''The Royal Tenenbaums''.<ref>{{cite web
| title = Wes is having trouble with the reception | url = http://www.screenmachine.tv/2012/issue/walmsley-evans1/ | publisher = SCREEN Machine | accessdate = July 5, 2012}}</ref> In September 2006, following the disappointing commercial and critical reception of ''The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou'', [[Steely Dan]]'s [[Walter Becker]] and [[Donald Fagen]] released a tongue-in-cheek "letter of intervention" for Anderson's artistic "malaise". Proclaiming themselves to be fans of "World Cinema" and Anderson in particular, they offered Anderson their soundtrack services for his ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]'', including lyrics for a title track.<ref name = "Steely Dan">{{cite web | last = Becker | first = Walter | authorlink = Walter Becker | author2=[[Donald Fagen]] | title = Attention Wes Anderson | url = http://www.steelydan.com/heywes.html | publisher = [[Steely Dan]] | date=August 2006 | accessdate = August 22, 2007}}</ref>

''The Darjeeling Limited'' (2007), about three emotionally distant brothers traveling together on a train in [[India]], reflected the more dramatic tone of ''The Royal Tenenbaums'', but faced similar criticisms to ''The Life Aquatic''. Anderson has acknowledged that he went to India to film the 2007 movie, partly as a tribute to the Indian filmmaker [[Satyajit Ray]], whose "films have also inspired all my other movies in different ways" (the film is dedicated to him).<ref name = "The Statesman">{{cite web | title = On Ray's Trail | url = http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=30&id=172929&usrsess=1 | publisher = The Statesman | accessdate = October 19, 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080103071501/http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=30&id=172929&usrsess=1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = January 3, 2008}}</ref> The film starred Anderson staples [[Jason Schwartzman]] and [[Owen Wilson]] in addition to [[Adrien Brody]], and the script was co-written by Anderson, Schwartzman and [[Roman Coppola]].<ref name = "Production Weekly">{{cite web | title = Wilson & Anderson reminisce over a cup of Darjeeling | url = http://productionweekly.com/2006/08/02/wilson-and-anderson-reminisce-over-a-cup-of-darjeeling/ | publisher = Production Weekly | date=August 2006 | accessdate = August 22, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 2008, Anderson was hired to write the screenplay of the American adaptation of ''[[Mon Meilleur Ami|My Best Friend]]'', a French film, for producer [[Brian Grazer]]; Anderson's first draft was titled "The Rosenthaler Suite".

Anderson's [[Stop motion|stop motion animation]] [[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|adaptation]] of the [[Roald Dahl]] book ''[[Fantastic Mr Fox]]'' was released in 2009. Although not earning much more than its production budget, the film was highly praised and nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].

Following the critical success of ''Fantastic Mr. Fox'', Anderson made ''[[Moonrise Kingdom]]'', which opened the [[Cannes Film Festival]] 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/03/wes-anderson-moonrise-kingdom-opening-cannes.html|title= Wes Anderson|accessdate=May 20, 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 8, 2012}}</ref> The film, emblematic of Anderson's style, was a financial success and earned Anderson another Academy Award nomination for his screenplay.

Anderson's latest film, ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' (2014), starred [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[Jude Law]], [[F. Murray Abraham]], and [[Saoirse Ronan]], among many others, along with several of his regular collaborators including Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Jason Schwartzman.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eisenberg|first=Eric|title=Wes Anderson Says The Grand Budapest Hotel Is Mostly Set in the Late 1920s|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Wes-Anderson-Says-Grand-Budapest-Hotel-Mostly-Set-Late-1920s-33862.html|publisher=Cinema Blend|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}</ref> Set in the 1930s, it followed the adventures of M. Gustave, the hotel's concierge, making "a marvelous mockery of history, turning its horrors into a series of graceful jokes and mischievous gestures", according to ''The New York Times''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A.

Anderson has also created several notable short films. In addition to the original ''Bottle Rocket'' short, he made the [[Paris]]-set ''[[Hotel Chevalier]]'' (2007), which was created as a prologue to ''The Darjeeling Limited'' and starred Jason Schwartzman and [[Natalie Portman]], and the [[Italy]]-set ''[[Castello Cavalcanti]]'' (2013),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/11/13/wes_anderson_new_short_film_castello_cavalcanti_starring_jason_schwartzman.html|title= Wes Anderson Honors Fellini in a Delightful New Short Film|accessdate=November 12, 2013 | work=Slate|date=November 12, 2013}}</ref> which was produced by [[Prada]] and starred Jason Schwartzman as an unsuccessful race-car driver. Additionally, he has directed a number of television commercials for companies such as [[Stella Artois]] and Prada, including an elaborate [[American Express]] ad, in which he starred as himself.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/wes-andersons-5-best-commercials-20130501?page=2#blogPostHeaderPanel|title= Wes Anderson's 5 Best Commercials|accessdate=November 12, 2013 | work=Indiewire|date=May 1, 2013}}</ref>

==Directing techniques==

===Themes and stories===
Anderson has chosen to direct mostly fast-paced comedies marked by more serious or melancholic elements, with themes often centered on grief, loss of innocence, parental abandonment, adultery, sibling rivalry and unlikely friendships. His movies have been noted for being unusually character-driven, and by turns both derided and praised with terms like "literary geek chic". The plots of his movies often feature thefts and unexpected disappearances, with a tendency to borrow liberally from the caper genre.<ref>{{cite web|last=Klein et al |first=Joshua |url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/andersonwes.htm |title=Wes Anderson |publisher=They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

===Visual style===
Anderson has been noted for his extensive use of flat space camera moves, obsessively symmetrical compositions, snap-zooms, slow-motion walking shots, a deliberately limited color palette, and hand-made art direction often utilizing miniatures.<ref>{{cite web|last=Buono |first=Alex |url=http://www.alex-buono.com/how-we-did-it-snl-the-midnight-coterie-of-sinister-intruders/ |title=How We Did It: The Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders |publisher=www.alex-buono.com |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref> These stylistic choices give his movies a highly distinctive quality that has provoked much discussion, critical study, supercuts and mash-ups, and even parody. Many writers, critics and even Anderson himself have commented that this gives his movies the feel of being "self-contained worlds", or a "scale model household". According to [[Michael Chabon]], with "a [[baroque pop]] bent that is not realist, surrealist or magic realist", but rather might be described as "fabul[ist]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Chabon |first=Michael |url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/jan/31/wes-anderson-worlds/ |title=Wes Anderson's Worlds | publisher=New York Review of Books |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref> {{failed verification|date=December 2014}}

From ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou|The Life Aquatic]]'' on, Anderson has relied more heavily on stop motion animation and miniatures, even making an entire feature with stop motion animation with ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vera |first=Noel |url=http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=86473 |title=Courtesan au chocolat |publisher=Businessworld |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

===Soundtracks===
Anderson frequently uses pop music from the 1960s and 70s on the soundtracks of his films, and one band or musician tends to dominate each soundtrack. In ''[[Rushmore (film)|Rushmore]]'', [[Cat Stevens]] and [[British Invasion]] groups featured prominently, ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]'' included multiple songs recorded by Nico and [[The Velvet Underground]], ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou|The Life Aquatic]]'' was replete with [[David Bowie]] including both originals and [[Cover version|covers]] performed by [[Seu Jorge]], [[The Kinks]] appeared on the soundtrack for ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]'', [[The Beach Boys]] in ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'', and [[Hank Williams]] for ''[[Moonrise Kingdom]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moeckel |first=Casey |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/news/the-music-of-wes-andersons-cinematic-world/|title=The Music of Wes Anderson's Cinematic World |publisher=Songlyrics.com |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref> ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]'' is notable for being the first Anderson film to eschew using any pop music from the 1950s, 60s or 70s, likely due to it being set in the early 1930s. The soundtracks for his films have often brought renewed attention to the artists featured, most prominently in the case of "[[These Days (Jackson Browne song)|These Days]]", which was used in ''[[The Royal Tenenbaums]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/01/jackson-browne-these-days/ | title=Jackson Browne, 'These Days' | author=Inman, Davis | magazine=[[American Songwriter]] | date=January 2, 2012}}</ref>
