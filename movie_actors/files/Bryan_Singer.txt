'''Bryan Jay Singer''' (born September 17, 1965)<ref name=filmref /> is an American film and television director, film and television producer, story writer, screenwriter, and actor. He is the founder of [[Bad Hat Harry Productions]]  and he has produced or co-produced almost all of the films he has directed. He wrote and directed his first film in 1988 after graduating from university. His next film, ''[[Public Access]]'' (1993), was a co-winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 1993 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. In the mid-1990s, Singer received critical acclaim for directing the neo-noir crime thriller ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995), which starred [[Stephen Baldwin]], [[Benicio del Toro]] and [[Kevin Spacey]]. He followed this with another thriller, ''[[Apt Pupil (film)|Apt Pupil]]'' (1998), about a boy's fascination with a Nazi war criminal.

In the 2000s, he became known for big budget superhero films such as ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000), for which Singer won the 2000 [[Saturn Award for Best Direction]], its sequel ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' (2003), and ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006). He then directed the WW II historical thriller ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'' (2008), co-wrote/co-produced ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' (2011) and directed the fantasy adventure film ''[[Jack the Giant Slayer]]'' (2013). In 2014, another X-Men film helmed by him was released, titled ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', and he will direct ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', which is expected to be released in May 2016. He has directed and produced some television shows, including two episodes of ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' in 2004.

==Early life==
Singer was born in [[New York City]], and was adopted by Grace Sinden, an environmental activist, and Norbert Dave Singer, a corporate executive.<ref name=filmref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/75/Bryan-Singer.html |title=Bryan Singer Biography (1965–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref> He grew up in a [[Jew]]ish household in [[West Windsor Township, New Jersey]].

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2010}}

===1980s–1990s===
After graduating from university, Singer directed a short film in 1988 called ''[[Lion's Den (1988 film)|Lion's Den]]'' involving a number of friends, including actor [[Ethan Hawke]] whom he knew from his childhood in New Jersey<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.johnottman.com/projects/edited/lionsden/ | title=Projects – Lion's Den | author=John Ottman | work=johnottman.com | accessdate=January 2, 2008 }}</ref> and editor [[John Ottman]] who he had met while working on a friend's short film.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.johnottman.com/projects/edited/summer/ | title=Projects – Summer Rain | author=John Ottman | work=johnottman.com | accessdate=January 2, 2008 }}</ref> After a screening of ''Lion's Den'', Singer was approached by someone who knew of a Japanese company that funded low-budget films. Singer wrote the concept for ''[[Public Access]]'' (1993) with high school friend [[Christopher McQuarrie]], and fellow [[University of Southern California|USC]] student Michael Feit Dougan wrote the first draft in ten days about a supposedly idyllic small town. Ottman again served as editor but this time also composed the score for the film. At the 1993 [[Sundance Film Festival]], the film was named as co-winner of the [[Grand Jury Prize]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5009328.stm |title=Comic book crusader: Bryan Singer |author=BBC |date=July 13, 2006 |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuvein.com/directedby/bryansinger.html |title=Focus bryan singer |author=Carsten Dau |year=2001 |work=Directed By Online |publisher=Directed By Online |accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>

While attending the 1993 Sundance Film Festival, Singer and McQuarrie began discussing an idea that McQuarrie had for a story where "five criminals meet in a police line-up". The film, ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'', won a number of awards including the 1995 [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film]]. Writer McQuarrie won the [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay]], composer/editor Ottman won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing]] and the [[Saturn Award for Best Music]] and actor [[Kevin Spacey]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In 1998, Singer directed ''[[Apt Pupil (film)|Apt Pupil]]'' from a screenplay written by Brandon Boyce, another of his friends. The story, adapted from a [[Stephen King]] novella of the same name (collected in the book ''[[Different Seasons]]''), tells of a young boy who develops a morbid fascination with a Nazi war criminal.

===2000s===
Singer was initially approached by [[20th Century Fox]] to direct ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' after directing ''The Usual Suspects'', but not being a fan of comics and being unaware of the characters, Singer turned them down. However his friend, [[Tom DeSanto]], a big fan of the comics and partner in his production company Bad Hat Harry Productions, eventually persuaded Singer to reconsider and, after reading the comics and becoming familiar with the characters, Singer signed on to direct. Rejecting all the scripts and storylines that were developed over a decade of failed production attempts, Singer developed the story for the film with DeSanto in a week and then worked on the script with writers [[Ed Solomon]], [[Christopher McQuarrie]], [[Joss Whedon]], and finally [[David Hayter]] (who had started out as Singer's driver). Only Hayter received onscreen credit for writing the film. Singer won the 2000 [[Saturn Award for Best Direction]] for ''X-Men''.
[[File:BryanSinger edited.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Singer in 2006]]
In early 2001, Singer was planning to direct ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'' with [[Johnny Depp]] in the lead role, from [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s script based on the [[Chuck Barris]] book of the same name. Financial troubles delayed production and Singer moved on. The film was later directed by [[George Clooney]] for [[Miramax Films]] with [[Sam Rockwell]] in the lead role. Singer has said that he was "very impressed" by Clooney's debut as a director, and the film itself. In late 2001, Singer was planning to help DeSanto produce a new ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' television series for [[Studios USA]] (now [[NBC Universal]] Television Studio) and the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] network. Singer was scheduled to direct the mini-series which would have served as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a potential series. Speaking to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in February 2001, Singer said he was "confident that the ''Galactica'' brand is a sleeping giant. It was a show I watched during its initial run, from the pilot to the final episode. The essence and the brand name is quite potent in a climate where there's a great deficit of sci-fi programming."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1185914.stm | title=Battlestar Galactica set for TV return | date=February 23, 2001 | author=BBC | work=BBC News | publisher=BBC | accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref> Despite his enthusiasm, production delays caused by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] meant Singer had to drop out due to his commitment to direct ''[[X2 (film)|X-Men 2]]''. FOX then lost interest in ''Galactica'' and Studios USA took the project to the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] and a different production team. This resulted in the new ''[[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' 2003 mini-series and 2004 television series, which ran until 2008. By August 2012 the script was being rewritten, with Singer explaining that "It will exist, I think, quite well between the Glen Larson and Ron Moore universes".

In June 2002 filming began on ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' in Canada with Singer again directing, this time from a screenplay written by [[David Hayter]], [[Dan Harris (screenwriter)|Dan Harris]] and [[Michael Dougherty]]. In 2004, ''X2'' was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form]], but lost to [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. In 2002, having learned that Singer was a lifelong ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan, [[Patrick Stewart]] arranged for Singer to visit the set of ''[[Star Trek Nemesis]]'' and appear in the finished film as a [[Starfleet]] officer on the bridge of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise'']]. On November 16, 2004, a new medical drama debuted on FOX called ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', with Singer attached as an executive producer. He also directed the pilot and the third episode, then appeared in a brief cameo as himself in the twelfth episode.

In mid-2004, Singer was in negotiations to direct ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' for Fox. Fox and Singer could not meet an agreement and, after an extended détente, Singer was offered the chance to direct the new [[Superman]] film, which was ready to go. On July 19, 2004, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Singer had signed on to direct ''[[Superman Returns]]'' for [[Warner Bros.]] In retaliation, Fox terminated their production deal with Bad Hat Harry Productions, Singer's production company.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000601138 | title=Fox breaks off film deal with helmer Singer | author=Liza Foreman | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate=August 6, 2004 | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> ''Superman Returns'' was filmed in Australia in 2005, and was released on June 28, 2006. Singer claims that though he had not read the comics, he had always admired and identified with the character, citing the fact that he and Superman are both orphans. He instead based ''Returns'' on his love of the 1978 film made by [[Richard Donner]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Bryan+Singer+director+of+Superman+Returns/ | title = Bryan Singer director of Superman Returns | author = Daniel Robert Epstein | date = May 3, 2006 | work = SuicideGirls.com | accessdate = October 7, 2006 }}</ref>
[[File:Bryan Singer.2776.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Singer at the premiere of ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'' in 2009]]
Before embarking on the Superman sequel, Singer openly discussed helming a smaller project going back to the days of thrillers ''The Usual Suspects'' and ''Apt Pupil''. In late 2006, screenwriter [[Christopher McQuarrie]] presented to Singer a story that took place in World War II, ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]''. In the following months, the two collaborated on the project, an original thriller that would be a multi-character ensemble piece. In March 2007, the duo brought the project directly to [[United Artists]] partners [[Paula Wagner]] and [[Tom Cruise]], who immediately agreed to finance the film. The script is based on the actual events of German generals plotting to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]] during [[World War II]]. Singer invited Tom Cruise to take the lead role, which Cruise accepted. Filming began on July 19, 2007 in Berlin, and the movie was released on December 25, 2008. Upon finishing ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'' at the end of 2007, Singer was scheduled to jump directly into the upcoming Superman sequel, which was to begin filming around March 2008. Attending the 2007 [[Saturn Awards]] along with ''[[Superman Returns]]'' writers [[Michael Dougherty]], [[Dan Harris (screenwriter)|Dan Harris]] and producer Gil Adler, Singer stated that the story had been locked down, and the first draft would be completed near the end of 2007. Plans for the sequel included more action sequences, an alien villain, and Singer's promise to "go all ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan|Wrath of Khan]]'' on it". Production on the film was eventually cancelled, in favor of a [[Man of Steel (film)|reboot]] directed by [[Zack Snyder]].

In August 2009, Universal Pictures announced that Singer would direct and produce a big screen reimagining of the ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|television series]] of the late-1970s, which would not draw any material from the Syfy Channel [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|reimagined series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/08/13/bryan-singer-battlestar-galactica-movie|title=Bryan Singer to direct and produce 'Battlestar Galactica' movie|author=Nicole Sperling}}</ref> On September 10, 2009, it was announced NBC has partnered with Bryan Singer and [[Bryan Fuller]] to adapt [[Augusten Burroughs]]'s ''[[Sellevision]]'' into a series.

In April 2014, Singer was accused in a civil lawsuit of [[sexual assault]] of a minor.

In May 2014, another lawsuit was filed by attorney Jeff Herman on behalf of an anonymous British man.
