==Acting career==
===Early roles, 1951–1959===
After the end of World War II, Bronson worked at many odd jobs until joining a theatrical group in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. He later shared an apartment in [[New York City]] with [[Jack Klugman]] while both were aspiring to play on the stage. In 1950, he married and moved to [[Hollywood]], where he enrolled in acting classes and began to find small roles. Bronson's first film role&nbsp;— an uncredited one&nbsp;— was as a sailor in ''[[You're in the Navy Now]]'' in 1951. Other early screen appearances were in ''[[Pat and Mike]]'',
''[[Miss Sadie Thompson]]'' and ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'' (as [[Vincent Price]]'s mute henchman Igor).

In 1952, Bronson boxed in a ring with [[Roy Rogers]] in Rogers' show ''Knockout''. He appeared on an episode of ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'' as a boxer in a skit with Skelton playing "Cauliflower McPugg".  He also had a part credited as Charles Buchinsky in a western named "Riding Shotgun", starring Randolph Scott. In 1954, Bronson made a strong impact in ''[[Drum Beat]]'' as a murderous [[Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma|Modoc]] warrior, Captain Jack, who relishes wearing the tunics of soldiers he has killed. Eventually captured, Captain Jack is sent to the gallows. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
In 1954, during the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) proceedings, he changed his surname from Buchinsky to Bronson at the suggestion of his agent, who feared that an Eastern European surname might damage his career.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000314/bio Charles Bronson (I) - Biography] IMDb</ref> He reportedly took his inspiration from the Bronson Gate at the studios of [[Paramount Pictures]], situated on the corner of [[Melrose Avenue]] and Bronson Street. He made several appearances on television in the 1950s and 1960s, including a 1952 segment, with fellow guest star [[Lee Marvin]], of ''[[Biff Baker, U.S.A.]]'', an espionage series on [[CBS]] starring [[Alan Hale, Jr.]]. Bronson had the lead role of the episode "The Apache Kid" of the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[Crime film|crime drama]] ''[[Sheriff of Cochise]]'', starring [[John Bromfield]]; Bronson was subsequently cast twice in 1959 in Bromfield's ''[[Sheriff of Cochise|U.S. Marshal]]''.

He guest-starred in the short-lived CBS [[situation comedy]], ''[[Hey, Jeannie!]]'' and in three episodes of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'': ''And So Died Riabouchinska'' (1956), ''There Was an Old Woman'' (1956), and ''The Woman Who Wanted to Live'' (1962). In 1959, he played Steve Ogrodowski, a naval intelligence officer, in two episodes of the CBS military sitcom/drama, ''[[Hennesey]]'', starring [[Jackie Cooper]]. Bronson starred alongside [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] in ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Two (The Twilight Zone)|Two]]" (1961) and played a killer named Crego in ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1956). He appeared in five episodes of [[Richard Boone]]'s ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'' (1957–1963). In 1957, Bronson was cast in the Western series ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]'' as an outlaw named Danny Arnold in the episode "Young Gun".<ref>{{citation|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Colt45.htm|title=Young Gun|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=December 22, 2012}}</ref>

In 1958, he was cast in his first lead role in [[Roger Corman]]'s ''[[Machine-Gun Kelly (film)|Machine-Gun Kelly]]''. He scored the lead in his own [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s detective series ''[[Man with a Camera]]'' (from 1958 to 1960), in which he portrayed Mike Kovac, a former combat photographer freelancing in New York City.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Success, 1960–1968===
[[File:Charles Bronson 1961.JPG|thumb|right|Publicity Photo, 1961]]
Bronson was cast in the 1960 episode "Zigzag" of ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', starring [[Darren McGavin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0687123|title="Zigzag", next-to-the last episode, December 26, 1960|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 21, 2013}}</ref> That same year, he was cast as "Dutch Malkin" in the 1960 episode "The Generous Politician" of ''[[The Islanders (TV series)|The Islanders]]''. In 1960, he garnered attention in [[John Sturges]]' ''The Magnificent Seven'', in which he was cast as one of seven gunfighters taking up the cause of the defenseless. During filming, Bronson was a loner who kept to himself, according to [[Eli Wallach]].<ref>[http://www.americanlegends.com/actors/eili%20wallach/index.html Exclusive interview with Eli Wallach]</ref> He received $50,000 for this role.<ref>"Stagecoach to tombstone: the filmgoers' guide to the great westerns". I.B. Tauris, 2008; ISBN 1-84511-571-6/ISBN 978-1-84511-571-5</ref> This role made him a favorite actor of many in the since disbanded [[Soviet Union]], such as [[Vladimir Vysotsky]].<ref>''[[:ru:Новиков, Владимир Иванович|Владимир Иванович Новиков/V.I. Novikov]]'' "Высоцкий/Vysotskiĭ". [[Moscow]]: [[Molodaya Gvardiya (publisher)|Molodaia gvardiia]], 2002; ISBN 5-235-02541-5/ISBN 978-5-235-02541-7</ref><ref>"Живая жизнь/Živaja žizn: štrichi k biografii Vladimira Vysockogo".

Two years later, Sturges cast him for another Hollywood production, ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', as a claustrophobic Polish [[prisoner of war]] nicknamed "The Tunnel King" (coincidentally, Bronson was really claustrophobic because of his childhood work in a mine). In 1961, he was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his supporting role in an episode entitled "Memory in White" of CBS's ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', hosted by [[Ronald Reagan]]. In 1962, he played alongside [[Elvis Presley]] as his loyal trainer, Lew Nyack, in ''[[Kid Galahad]]''. In 1963, Bronson co-starred in the [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[TV series|series]] ''[[Empire (1962 TV series)|Empire]].'' In the 1963–1964 television season he portrayed Linc, the stubborn [[wagonmaster]] in the ABC western series, ''[[The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (TV series)|The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters]]''. In the 1965–1966 season, he guest-starred in an episode of ''[[The Legend of Jesse James (TV series)|The Legend of Jesse James]]''. In 1965, Bronson was cast as a demolitions expert in an episode of ABC's ''[[Combat!]]''. Thereafter, in ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967), he played an Army [[death row]] convict conscripted into a suicide mission. In 1967, he guest starred as Ralph Schuyler, an undercover government agent in the episode "The One That Got Away" on ABC's ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===European roles and rise with United Artists, 1968–1973===
Bronson made a serious name for himself in European films. In 1968, he starred as Harmonica in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]''. The director, [[Sergio Leone]], once called him "the greatest actor I ever worked with",{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} and had wanted to cast Bronson for the lead in 1964's ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''. Bronson turned him down and the role launched [[Clint Eastwood]] to film stardom. In 1970, Bronson starred in the French film ''[[Rider on the Rain]]'', which won a Hollywood [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. The following year, this overseas fame earned him a special Golden Globe [[Henrietta Award]] for "World Film Favorite - Male" together with [[Sean Connery]]. In 1972 he began a string of successful action films for [[United Artists]], beginning with ''[[Chato's Land]]'', although he had done several films for UA before this in the 1960s (''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', etc.). One film UA brought into the domestic mainstream was ''[[Città violenta]]'', an Italian-made film originally released overseas in 1970. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===''Death Wish'' series and departure from UA, 1974–1980===
[[File:Charles Bronson - 1977.JPG|thumb|left|Bronson as Dan Shomron in ''Raid on Entebbe'' (1977)]]
Bronson's most famous role came when he was age 52, in ''[[Death Wish (film)|Death Wish]]'' ([[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], 1974), the most popular film of his long association with director [[Michael Winner]]. He played Paul Kersey, a successful New York [[architect]]. When his wife is murdered and his daughter sexually assaulted, Kersey becomes a crime-fighting [[vigilante]] by night. This successful movie spawned various sequels over the next two decades, in all of which Bronson appeared. 

In 1974, he had the title role in the [[Elmore Leonard]] film adaptation ''[[Mr. Majestyk]]'', as an army veteran and farmer who battles local gangsters. For [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Hard Times (1975 film)|Hard Times]]'' (1975), he starred as a Depression-era street fighter making his living in illegal bare-knuckled matches in Louisiana. He earned good reviews. Bronson reached his pinnacle in box-office drawing power in 1975, when he was ranked 4th, behind only [[Robert Redford]], [[Barbra Streisand]], and [[Al Pacino]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Howard|title=Filmgoers' guide to the great crime movies|publisher=I.B. Tauris|year=2006|page=xx|isbn=1-84511-219-9}}</ref> His stint at UA came to an end in 1977 with ''[[The White Buffalo]]''.

===Cannon Films era and final roles, 1981–1994===
He was considered for the role of [[Snake Plissken]] in ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), but director [[John Carpenter]] thought he was too tough looking and too old for the part, and decided to cast [[Kurt Russell]] instead. In the years between 1976 and 1994, Bronson commanded high salaries to star in numerous films made by smaller production companies, most notably [[The Cannon Group|Cannon Films]], for whom some of his last films were made. Many of them were directed by [[J. Lee Thompson]], a collaborative relationship that Bronson enjoyed and actively pursued, reportedly because Thompson worked quickly and efficiently. Thompson's ultra-violent films such as ''[[The Evil That Men Do (film)|The Evil That Men Do]]'' ([[TriStar Pictures]], 1984) and ''[[10 to Midnight]]'' (1983) were blasted by critics, but provided Bronson with well-paid work throughout the 1980s. Bronson's last starring role in a theatrically released film was 1994's ''[[Death Wish V: The Face of Death]]''. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Personal life==
[[File:CharlesBronsonStarHWF.jpg|thumb|right|Bronson's star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
[[File:Charles Bronson Cannes.jpg|thumb|At the 1987 [[Cannes Film Festival]]]]

His first marriage was to Harriet Tendler, whom he met when both were fledgling actors in Philadelphia. They had two children before divorcing in 1965. She wrote in her memoir that she "was an 18-year-old virgin when she met the 26-year-old Charlie Buchinsky at a Philadelphia acting school in 1947. Two years later, with the grudging consent of her father, a successful, [[Jews|Jewish]] dairy farmer, she wed the Catholic Lithuanian and former coal miner; supporting them both while Charlie pursued their acting dream. On their first date, he had four cents in his pocket&nbsp;— and went on, now as Charles Bronson, to become one of the highest paid actors in the country." {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Bronson was then married again to British actress [[Jill Ireland]] from October 5, 1968,<ref>Charles Bronson Documentary, Biography Channel.</ref> until her death in 1990. He had met her in 1962, when she was married to [[Scotland|Scottish]] actor [[David McCallum]]. At the time, Bronson (who shared the screen with McCallum in ''The Great Escape'') reportedly told him, "I'm going to marry your wife". The Bronsons lived in a grand Bel Air mansion in [[Los Angeles]] with seven children: two by his previous marriage, three by hers (one of whom was adopted) and two of their own (another one of whom was adopted). After they married, she often played his leading lady, and they starred in fourteen films together.

In order to maintain a close family, they would load up everyone and take them to wherever filming was taking place, so that they could all be together. They spent time in a colonial farmhouse on {{convert|260|acre|km2}} in [[West Windsor, Vermont]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-08-31-bronson-dies_x.htm|title=Action film star Charles Bronson dead at 81|accessdate=2008-12-19|work=USA Today|date=2003-09-01}}</ref> Jill Ireland raised horses and provided training for their daughter Zuleika so that she could perform at the higher levels of horse showing. The Vermont farm, "Zuleika Farm", was named for the only natural child between them. During the late 1980s through the mid-1990s Bronson regularly spent winter holidays vacationing with his family in [[Snowmass, Colorado]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On May 18, 1990, aged 54, after a long battle with the disease, Jill Ireland died of [[breast cancer]] at their home in [[Malibu, California]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DC1E3EF93AA25756C0A966958260|title=Jill Ireland, Actress, 54, Is Dead; Wrote of Her Fight With Cancer|last=Yarrow|first=Andrew L.|date=1990-05-19|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> In December 1998, Bronson was married a third time to Kim Weeks, a former employee of Dove Audio who had helped record Ireland in the production of her audiobooks. The couple were married for five years until Bronson's death in 2003.

===Death===
Bronson's health deteriorated in later years, and he retired from acting after undergoing hip-replacement surgery in 1998. He suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]] in his final years. Bronson died of [[pneumonia]] at age 81 on August 30, 2003 at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} He was interred at Brownsville Cemetery in West Windsor, Vermont.
