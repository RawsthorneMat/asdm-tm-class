He was considered a "divisive and controversial figure in Germany. His violent outbursts on set—famously captured on film in [[Werner Herzog|Herzog]]'s documentary '[[My Best Fiend]]'—are the stuff of legend."<ref name=Jackson/>

He is the father of [[Pola Kinski|Pola]], [[Nastassja Kinski|Nastassja]], and [[Nikolai Kinski]], born of three different marriages. They have all become actors and have worked in Germany and the United States, primarily in film and TV.

==Early life==
[[File:Klaus Kinski's birthplace in Sopot, Poland.jpg|300px|thumb|Klaus Kinski's parental home]]
Klaus Kinski was born to German nationals in [[Sopot|Zoppot]] in what was, under League of Nations supervision, the [[Free City of Danzig]] from 1920-1939. (It is now [[Sopot, Poland]]). His father, Bruno Nakszynski, a German of [[Poland|Polish]] descent,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/bps/browse/alpha/k/49 Encyclopædia Britannica]</ref> was a failed [[opera singer]] turned [[pharmacist]]; his mother, Susanne (née Lutze), was a [[nurse]] and the daughter of a local pastor.<ref name="wisebaron105">{{Harvnb|Wise| Baron|2002|p=105}}</ref> Klaus had three older siblings: Inge, Arne and Hans-Joachim.

Because of the [[Great Depression]], the family was unable to make a living in Danzig and moved to [[Berlin]] in 1931, where they also struggled.<ref name="wisebaron105"/> They settled in a flat in the Wartburgstraße 3, in the district of [[Schöneberg]], and took German citizenship.<ref name="wisebaron105"/> From 1936 on, Kinski attended the Prinz-Heinrich-Gymnasium in Schöneberg.<ref>{{Harvnb|David|2008|pp=10–13}}</ref>

==Career==

===Military service during World War II===
Kinski was conscripted at age 17 into the German [[Wehrmacht]] some time in 1943, serving in the army.<ref name="wisebaron106">{{Harvnb|Wise| Baron|2002|p=106}}</ref> He saw no action until the winter of 1944, when his unit was transferred to the [[Reichskommissariat Niederlande|Netherlands]].<ref name="wisebaron106"/> He was wounded and captured by the [[British Army|British]] on his second day of combat.<ref>"Klaus Kinski", ''[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]'', 1991</ref>

Kinski gave a different version of events in his 1988 autobiography. He said that he made a conscious decision to [[Desertion|desert]]; he had been captured by the Germans, [[court-martial]]ed as a deserter, and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]], but he escaped and hid in the woods. He finally surrendered to a British patrol, which had wounded him in the arm before taking him captive.<ref name="wisebaron106"/>

After being treated for his injuries and interrogated, Kinski was transferred to England. The ship transporting him was torpedoed by a German [[U-boat]], but arrived safely.<ref name="wisebaron106"/> Kinski was held at the [[prisoner of war]] "Camp 186" in [[Berechurch]] Hall in [[Colchester]], [[Essex]].<ref name="wisebaron106"/><ref name="David 2008 14–16">{{Harvnb|David|2008|pp=14–16}}</ref>

There he played his first roles on stage, taking part in shows intended to maintain morale among the prisoners.<ref name="wisebaron106"/><ref name="David 2008 14–16"/> By May 1945, at the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of the war in Europe]], the German POWs were anxious to return home. Kinski had heard that sick prisoners were to be returned first, and tried to qualify by standing outside naked at night, [[drinking urine]], and eating cigarettes.<ref name="wisebaron106"/> He remained healthy but finally was returned to Germany in 1946, after spending a year and four months in captivity.<ref name="wisebaron106"/>

Arriving in Berlin, he saw how the once modern city had been reduced to ruins and was [[Allied occupation of Berlin|occupied by Allied troops]]. Kinski learned his father had died during the war, and his mother had been killed in an [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Allied air attack]] on the city.<ref name="wisebaron106"/>

===Theatrical career===
After his return to Germany, Kinski started out as an actor,<ref>[[Werner Herzog|Herzog]],  ''[[My Best Fiend]]'', said that Kinski was self-taught as an actor.</ref> first at a small touring company in [[Offenburg]], where he used his newly adopted name of ''Klaus Kinski''. In 1946, he was hired by the renowned Schlosspark-Theater in Berlin. The next year he was fired by the manager in 1947 due to his unpredictable behavior.<ref>{{Harvnb|David|2008|pp=16–20}}</ref>

Other companies followed, but his unconventional and emotionally volatile behavior regularly got him into trouble.<ref>{{Harvnb|David|2008|pp=22–25}}</ref> In 1950, Kinski stayed in a [[psychiatric hospital]] for three days; medical records from the period listed a preliminary diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]].<ref>[http://www.bild.de/BILD/unterhaltung/leute/2008/07/22/klaus-kinski/psycho-akte-entdeckt-diagnose-schizophrenie.html "Psycho-Akte von Klaus Kinski entdeckt"], ''[[Bild]]'', 22 July 2008. {{de icon}}</ref> Around this time he became unable to secure film roles, and in 1955 Kinski twice tried to commit [[suicide]].<ref>{{Harvnb|David|2008|pp=41–42}}</ref> The same year, for three months, Kinski lived in the same boarding house as a 13-year-old [[Werner Herzog]], who would later direct him in a number of films. In the 1999 documentary ''[[My Best Fiend]]'', Herzog described how Kinski locked himself in the communal bathroom for 48 hours and reduced everything to bits.

In March 1956 he made a single guest appearance at [[Vienna]]'s [[Burgtheater]] in [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Torquato Tasso (play)|Torquato Tasso]]''. Although respected by his colleagues, among them [[Judith Holzmeister]], and cheered by the audience, Kinski did not gain a permanent contract. The Burgtheater's management became aware of the actor's earlier difficulties in Germany. He unsuccessfully tried to sue the company.<ref>{{Harvnb|David|2008|pp=48–59}}</ref>

Living jobless in Vienna, Kinski reinvented himself as a [[monologuist]] and [[spoken word]] artist.<ref>{{Harvnb|David|2008|pp=60–61}}</ref> He presented the prose and verse of [[François Villon]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Oscar Wilde]], among others. He established himself as an actor touring [[Austria]], Germany, and [[Switzerland]] with his shows.<ref>{{Harvnb|David|2008|pp=97–102}}</ref>

===Film work and later life===
Kinski's first film role was a small part in the 1948 film ''[[Morituri (1948 film)|Morituri]]''. He appeared in several German [[Edgar Wallace]] movies, and had bit parts in the American war films ''[[Decision Before Dawn]]'' (1951) and ''[[A Time to Love and a Time to Die]]'' (1958).  He starred as the doomed Jewish refugee in ''[[The Counterfeit Traitor]]'' with [[William Holden]].  In [[Alfred Vohrer]]'s ''[[The Dead Eyes of London|Die toten Augen von London]]'' (1961), his character refused any personal guilt for his evil deeds and claimed to have only followed the orders given to him. Kinski's performance reflected the post-war Germans' reluctance to take responsibility for what had happened during World War II.<ref>{{Harvnb|David|2008|pp=113–119, 136–141}}</ref>

During the 1960s and 70s, Kinski appeared in various European [[exploitation film]] genres, as well as more acclaimed works such as ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1965), wherein he featured in a supporting role as an [[anarchist]] prisoner on his way to the [[Gulag]].  He relocated to Italy during the late 1960s, and had roles in numerous [[spaghetti western]]s, including ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' (1965), ''[[A Bullet for the General]]'' (1966), ''[[The Great Silence]]'' (1968), and ''[[A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe]]'' (1975). He turned down a role in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'',<ref>{{Cite news  | url = http://thechronicleherald.ca/ArtsLife/1057438.html  | title = Keeping up with Jones  | author = Glenn Whipp  | publisher = [[Halifax Chronicle-Herald]]  | date = 2008-05-22  | accessdate=2008-05-22}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> describing the script as "moronically shitty".<ref>{{cite book |title= Kinski Uncut|last= Kinski|first= Klaus|authorlink=|coauthors=Joachim Neugröschel (translator) |year= 1996 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn= 0-7475-2978-7|page=294}}</ref> In 1977 he starred as the [[Urban guerrilla warfare|guerrillero]] [[Wilfried Böse]] in the [[Israel]]i movie ''[[Mivtsa Yonatan (film)|Operation Thunderbolt]]'', based on the events of the 1976 [[Operation Entebbe]]. 
[[File:Klaus Kinski Cannes-(retouched).jpg|thumb|At the Cannes Film Festival, late 1980s]]
He began to work with director Werner Herzog. Eventually, their collaboration brought him international recognition. They made a total of five films together: ''[[Aguirre: The Wrath of God]]'' (1972), ''[[Woyzeck (1979 film)|Woyzeck]]'' (1978), ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'' (1979), ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'' (1982), and ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' (1987). He was considered a controversial figure in Germany, as his emotional volatility was notorious, as were rumors of his numerous affairs with women.<ref name=Jackson/>

Kinski co-starred as a violently evil killer from the future in a 1987 Sci-Fi based TV film ''[[Timestalkers]]'', with [[William Devane]] and [[Lauren Hutton]].  His last film (which he wrote and directed) was ''[[Kinski Paganini]]'' (1989), in which he played the legendary [[violin]]ist [[Niccolò Paganini]].

Kinski reinforced his wild image by his accounts in his 1988 autobiography, ''[[All I Need Is Love]]'' (reprinted in 1996 as ''Kinski Uncut''). The book infuriated many, and prompted his second daughter [[Nastassja Kinski]] to file a [[libel]] suit against him, which she soon withdrew.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise| Baron|2002|p=107}}</ref> For many years, Kinski's own writings were the only source for facts about his life and were not questioned or doubted by independent analysts.

In his retrospective film on Kinski, ''My Best Fiend'' (also called ''My Favorite Enemy'', 1999), Herzog said that Kinski had fabricated much of his autobiography. The two even collaborated on the insults Kinski included about the director. In his film, Herzog showed lighter and humorous aspects of Kinski's personality, though he also describes severe difficulties in their working relationship. Also in 1999, director [[David Schmoeller]] released a short film entitled ''[[Crawlspace (1986 film)#Please Kill Mr. Kinski|Please Kill Mr. Kinski]]'', which relates stories of Kinski's erratic and disruptive behavior on the set of his 1986 film ''[[Crawlspace (1986 film)|Crawlspace]]''. The film features behind-the-scenes footage of Kinski's various confrontations with director and crewmembers, along with Schmoeller's account of the events.

In 2006 [[Christian David]] published the first comprehensive biography of Kinski, based on newly discovered archived material, personal letters, and interviews with the actor's friends and colleagues.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Peter Geyer]] published a paperback book of essays on Kinski's life and work.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Marriages and families==
Kinski married three times, having a child with each wife. These were singer [[Gislinde Kühlbeck]] and their daughter [[Pola Kinski]], actress Ruth Brigitte Tocki<ref>Welsh, James Michael; Gene D. Phillips; Rodney Hill. ''The Francis Ford Coppola Encyclopedia,'' Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press Inc., 2010, p. 154</ref> and their daughter [[Nastassja Kinski]], and Minhoi Geneviève Loanic and their son [[Nikolai Kinski]]. The children had almost no contact with each other while growing up.

According to his autobiography, he had many affairs, which he suggested included very young women and girls. In 2013, more than 20 years after her father's death, Pola published an autobiography entitled ''Kindermund'' (or "From a Child's Mouth"). In it she says her father had sexually abused her from the age of 5 to 19.<ref name=Jackson>{{cite news
