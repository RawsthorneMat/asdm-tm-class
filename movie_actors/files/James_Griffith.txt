'''James Griffith''' (February 13, 1916 &ndash; September 17, 1993) was an [[United States|American]] [[character actor]], [[musician]] and [[screenwriter]].

==Career==
Born in [[Los Angeles]], Griffith aspired to be a musician rather than an actor. Instead, he managed to find work in little theatres around Los Angeles, where the budding musician eased into a dual career of acting. He found success in the production ''They Can't Get You Down'' in 1939, but put his career on hold during [[World War II]] to serve with the [[United States Marine Corps]]. Following the war, Griffith switched from the stage to films when he appeared in the 1948 [[film noir]] picture ''[[Blonde Ice]]''. From then on, he enjoyed a lengthy career of [[Supporting actor|supporting]] and [[Bit part|bit roles]] (sometimes uncredited) in [[Western (genre)|westerns]] and detective films.

Though Griffith was generally cast as the outlaw in [[Western (genre)|Western]] pictures, he managed to garner a few memorable "good guy" roles over his many years in Hollywood &ndash;  [[Abraham Lincoln]] in both 1950's ''Stage to Tucson'' and 1955's ''Apache Ambush'', sheriff [[Pat Garrett]] in 1954's ''The Law vs. Billy the Kid'', [[John Wesley Hardin]] in a 1959 television episode of ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' entitled "[[Duel at Sundown (Maverick)|Duel at Sundown]]" featuring [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Davy Crockett]] in 1956's ''[[The First Texan]]''.

In the role of Aaron Adams, the town barber, Griffith appeared in 1958 in twelve episodes of the CBS western series, ''[[Trackdown (TV series)|Trackdown]]'', starring [[Robert Culp]] as [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Hoby Gilman. Secondary roles on the series were also filled by [[Peter Leeds]] as gambler/saloon owner Tenner Smith, [[Ellen Corby]] as newspaper publisher Henrietta Porter, [[Addison Richards]] as the town doctor, Jay Calhoun, and [[Gail Kobe]] as Penny Adams, the sister of Aaron Adams, who in several episodes shows a romantic interest in the Gilman character.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), p. 104</ref>

Griffith also had recurring roles in the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] series, ''[[Sheriff of Cochise]],'' starring [[John Bromfield]], and ''[[U.S. Marshal (TV series)|U.S. Marshal]].''

Griffith made more than seventy guest appearances on television shows, including eight episodes of ''[[Wagon Train]]'', seven episodes of ''[[The Range Rider]]'', seven episodes of ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'', two episodes of ''[[Annie Oakley (TV series)|Annie Oakley]]'', four episodes of ''[[Cheyenne]]'', three episodes of ''[[Buffalo Bill, Jr.]]'', six episodes of ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', four episodes of ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', four episodes of ''[[Dragnet (series)#Television|Dragnet]]'', three episodes (42, 43 and 108) of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', and two segments of ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]''.

Throughout his acting career, Griffith continued to practice his original love of music, having performed in the [[Spike Jones]] band. he composed music for the 1958 film ''Bullwhip'' and the 1964 picture, ''[[Lorna (film)|Lorna]],'' in which he also had a role and served as screenwriter. Griffith played the Reverend in Black in the opening, closing, and a few in the middle scenes of ''Lorna'', starring [[Lorna Maitland]] in one of [[Film director|director]] [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[black-and-white]] 'skin' movies before the height of Meyer's career in 1968 with ''Beyond the Valley of the Dolls''.

Griffith made his last onscreen appearance in a 1982 episode of CBS' ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''.

==Death==
Griffith died of [[cancer]] in [[Avila Beach, California|Avila Beach]], California, on September 17, 1993.
