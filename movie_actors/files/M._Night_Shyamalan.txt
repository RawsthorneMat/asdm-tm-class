His major films include the supernatural thriller ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' (1999), the superhero drama thriller ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'' (2000), the science fiction thriller ''[[Signs (film)|Signs]]'' (2002), the psychological thriller ''[[The Village (2004 film)|The Village]]'' (2004), the fantasy thriller ''[[Lady in the Water]]'' (2006), the fantasy adventure film ''[[The Last Airbender]]'' (2010), and the sci-fi action adventure film ''[[After Earth]]'' (2013). He is also known for filming and setting his movies in and around [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, where he was raised, and for including [[plot twist]]s in most of his films.

Most of Shyamalan's commercially successful films were co-produced and released by the [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]' [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]] and [[Hollywood Pictures|Hollywood]] film imprints. In 2008, Shyamalan was awarded the [[Padma Shri]] by the government of [[India]].<ref>[http://india.gov.in/myindia/padmashri_awards_list1.php?start=40 Padma Shri Awardees&nbsp;— Padma Awards].</ref> 

==Early life==

Shyamalan was born in [[Mahé, India]].<ref name=bio /><ref>Bamberger, Michael. ''The Man Who Heard Voices: Or, How M. Night Shyamalan Risked His Career on a Fairy Tale'' (Gotham Books, New York, 2006), p. 150.</ref> His mother, Jayalakshmi, is a [[Tamil people|Tamilian]] and is an [[Obstetrics and gynecology|obstetrician and gynecologist]] by profession. His father, Nelliate C. Shyamalan, is a [[Malayali people|Malayali]] and is a traditional physician ([[Vaidyar]]) from [[Mahé, India|Mahé]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chennaionline.com/columns/variety/variety9.asp |title=Chennai Online |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090209040153/http://archives.chennaionline.com/columns/variety/variety9.asp |archivedate=9 February 2009}}</ref> In the 1960s, after medical school (at the [[Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research]] in [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]]) and the birth of their first child, Veena, his parents moved to the United States. His mother returned to India to spend the last five months of her pregnancy at her parents’ home in [[Chennai]].

Shyamalan spent his first six weeks in [[Puducherry]], and then was raised in [[Penn Valley, Pennsylvania]], an affluent suburb of [[Philadelphia]]. Although Hindu, he attended the private [[Catholic school|Roman Catholic grammar school]] [[Waldron Mercy Academy]], followed by the [[Episcopal Academy]], a private [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] [[high school]] located at the time in [[Merion, Pennsylvania]]. Shyamalan earned the New York University Merit Scholarship in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|last=Edelstein |first=David |url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/17661/ |title=nymag.com |publisher=nymag.com |date=16 July 2006 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> Shyamalan is an alumnus of [[New York University]]’s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], in [[Manhattan]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://about.tisch.nyu.edu/page/deanMessage.html |publisher=about.tisch.nyu.edu |title= Dean's Message }}</ref> graduating in 1992. It was while studying there that he adopted Night as his second name.<ref>{{cite web | last = Edelstein | first = David | title = M. Narcissus Shyamalan | publisher = New York Magazine | date = 16 July 2006 | url = http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/17661/ | accessdate = 27 April 2010 }}</ref>

Shyamalan had an early desire to be a filmmaker when he was given a [[Super-8]] camera at a young age. Though his father wanted him to follow in the family practice of medicine, his mother encouraged him to follow his passion.<ref>[http://www.nndb.com/people/232/000026154/ NNDB] -Manoj Shyamalan.</ref> By the time he was seventeen the [[Steven Spielberg]] fan had made forty-five home movies. On each DVD release of his films (beginning with ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and with the exception of ''[[Lady in the Water]]''), he has included a scene from one of these childhood movies which he feels represents his first attempt at the same kind of film.

==Career==
[[File:M. Night Shyamalan and Mark Wahlberg 01.jpg|thumb|M. Night Shyamalan and [[Mark Wahlberg]] (right) at the presentation of the film ''[[The Happening (2008 film)|The Happening]]'' in [[Madrid]].]]
Shyamalan made his first film, the semi-autobiographical [[drama]] ''[[Praying with Anger]]'', while still a student at NYU, using money borrowed from family and friends.<ref>Bamberger, Ibid., p. 19.</ref> He wrote and directed his second movie, ''[[Wide Awake (1998 film)|Wide Awake]]''. His parents were the film's [[Film producer#Types of Producers|associate producers]]. The drama dealt with a ten-year-old Catholic schoolboy ([[Joseph  Michael Cross|Joseph Cross]]) who, after the death of his grandfather ([[Robert Loggia]]), searches for God. The film's supporting cast included [[Dana Delany]] and [[Denis Leary]] as the boy's parents, as well as [[Julia Stiles]] and [[Camryn Manheim]]. ''Wide Awake'' was filmed in a school Shyamalan attended as a child<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/m-night-shyamalan Answers.com] - Wide Awake.</ref> and earned 1999 [[Young Artist Award]] nominations for Best Drama, and, for Cross, Best Performance.<ref>[http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms20.htm Young Artists Award] - Past Nominations Listing.</ref> Only in limited release, the film grossed $305,704 in theaters, against a $6 million budget.<ref>[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/WIDEA.php The Numbers] - Wide Awake Box Office Data.</ref>

That same year Shyamalan co-wrote the screenplay for ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]'' with [[Greg Brooker (screenwriter)|Greg Brooker]]. In 2013, he revealed he was the [[ghostwriter]] for the 1999 film ''[[She's All That]]'', a teen comedy starring Freddie Prinze Jr and Rachel Leigh Cook.<ref>[http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/m-night-shyamalan-reveals-he-ghost-wrote-shes-all/309181#3SYmDvZof510xWCG.99 M Night Shyamalan reveals he ghost-wrote 'She's All That']</ref> However this statement has come into question as the credited screenwriter for the film, R. Lee Fleming Jr., denied Shyamalan's involvement in a now deleted tweet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/06/17/m_night_shyamalan_lied_about_writing_shes_all_that_says_screenwriter_partner/|first=Daniel|last=Kibblesmith|accessdate=5 October 2013|date=17 June 2013|title=Wait, did M. Night Shyamalan lie about writing "She's All That"?}}</ref>

Shyamalan gained international recognition when he wrote and directed 1999's ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', which was a commercial success and later nominated for six Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].

In July 2000, on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', Shyamalan said he had met with Steven Spielberg and was in early talks to write the script for the [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|fourth Indiana Jones film]]. This would have given Shyamalan a chance to work with his longtime idol, [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref>[http://www.premiere.com/movienews/3372/indiana-jones-and-the-curse-of-development-hell-page2.html Premiere.com - "Indiana Jones and the Curse of Development Hell", By Ann Donahue].</ref> After the film fell through, Shyamalan later said it was too "tricky" to arrange and "not the right thing" for him to do.<ref>''Science Fiction Weekly'', {{issue|date=March 2013}}</ref>

Shyamalan followed ''The Sixth Sense'' by writing and directing ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', released in 2000, which received positive reviews.

Shyamalan's name was linked with the 2001 film ''[[Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', but it conflicted with the production of ''Unbreakable''. In July 2006, while doing press tours for ''Lady in the Water'', Shyamalan had said he was still interested in directing one of the last two ''Harry Potter'' films. "The themes that run through it...the empowering of children, a positive outlook...you name it, it falls in line with my beliefs", Shyamalan said. "I enjoy the humor in it. When I read the first ''Harry Potter'' and was thinking about making it, I had a whole different vibe in my head of it".<ref>Otto, Jeff (14 July 2006). [http://movies.ign.com/articles/718/718799p1.html "Potter in the Water? Shyamalan interested in magical franchise"]. IGN.</ref>

His 2002 film ''[[Signs (film)|Signs]]'', where he also played Ray Reddy, gained both critical and financial success. His next movie ''[[The Village (2004 film)|The Village]]'' (2004) received mixed reviews from the critics, but turned out to be a financial success.

[[File:Night Shyamalan-2.jpg|thumb|left|M. Night Shyamalan and [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] at the Spanish premiere of ''[[The Village (2004 film)|The Village]]'' (in the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]], 2006).]]
After the release of ''The Village'' in 2004, Shyamalan had been planning a film adaptation of Yann Martel's novel ''[[Life of Pi]]'' with 20th Century Fox, but later backed out so that he could make ''Lady in the Water''. "I love that book. I mean, it's basically [the story of] a kid born in the same city as me [Pondicherry, India]&nbsp;— it almost felt predestined", Shyamalan said. "But I was hesitant because the book has kind of a twist ending. And I was concerned that as soon as you put my name on it, everybody would have a different experience. Whereas if someone else did it, it would be much more satisfying, I think. Expectations, you've got to be aware of them. I'm wishing them all great luck. I hope they make a beautiful movie".<ref>Schwawrtz, Missy (3 May 2006). [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1190527,00.html "'Water' Bearer"]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.</ref>

Released in 2006, ''[[Lady in the Water]]'' performed worse critically and financially. The film ''[[The Happening (2008 film)|The Happening]]'' (2008) was a financial success but also received negative reviews. In 2010, he directed ''[[The Last Airbender]]'', based on the [[Nickelodeon]] TV show ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''. It received extremely negative reviews in the United States and won five [[Razzie Award]]s, but it made nearly $320 million internationally at the box office.

In July 2008, it was announced that Shyamalan had partnered with [[Media Rights Capital]] to form a production company called Night Chronicles. Shyamalan would produce, but not direct, one film a year for three years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117989271.html?categoryid=1237&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Night falls for Media Rights | first=Michael | last=Fleming | date=21 July 2008}}</ref> The first of the three films was ''[[Devil (2010 film)|Devil]]'', a supernatural thriller directed by siblings [[John Erick Dowdle|John]] and Drew Dowdle. The script was written by [[Brian Nelson (screenwriter)|Brian Nelson]], based on an original idea from Shyamalan.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994794.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&query=shyamalan|title=MRC, Shyamalan dance with 'Devil'|accessdate=3 January 2009 | work=Variety | first=Michael | last=Fleming | date=28 October 2008}}</ref> The movie was about a group of people stuck in an elevator with the devil, and starred [[Chris Messina (actor)|Chris Messina]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.newsinfilm.com/2009/10/19/details-on-shyamalan-story-devil/|title=Details on Shyamalan Story 'Devil'|accessdate=19 October 2009}}</ref> The film was not previewed by critics before its release, eventually receiving mixed reviews. ''Devil'' was not a blockbuster hit, but has become a commercial success relative to its budget. The next film in the Night Chronicles series will be called ''Reincarnate''. It will be scripted by Chris Sparling and directed by [[Daniel Stamm]]. 

In 2013 Shyamalan directed the film ''[[After Earth]]'', based on a script by [[Gary Whitta]] and starring [[Will Smith]] and [[Jaden Smith]]. It was received poorly by critics, with  [[Rotten Tomatoes]] giving the film a score of 11% based on 180 reviews.

Shyamalan currently has three television projects in production and varied stages of development. The first, titled ''Proof'', has been sold to the Sci-Fi channel, the second is being developed with NBC reportedly titled ''Lost Horizon'' and the third is an off-beat thriller titled ''[[Wayward Pines]]'', adapted from the novel of the same name and will be made for FOX.

Shyamalan announced in January 2014 that he would be working again with [[Bruce Willis]] on a film titled ''Labor of Love''.<ref>[http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/night-shyamalan-bruce-willis-reteam-labor-love/ M. Night Shyamalan And Bruce Willis Will Reteam For Labor Of Love]</ref> Later that year, in November, it was announced that Universal had picked up rights to a low budget movie called "The Visit" that Shyamalan had shot in secret.<ref name=Visitline>{{cite web|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike, JR|title=Universal Slots ‘The Visit’, M.

===Sci-Fi Channel hoax===
In 2004, Shyamalan was involved in a media [[hoax]] with [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]], which was eventually uncovered by the press. Sci-Fi claimed in its "documentary" special—''The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan'', shot on the set of ''The Village''—that Shyamalan was dead for nearly a half-hour while drowned in a frozen pond in a childhood accident, and that upon being rescued he had experiences of communicating with spirits, fueling an obsession with the supernatural.

In truth, Shyamalan developed the hoax with Sci-Fi, going so far as having Sci-Fi staffers sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s with a $5-million fine attached and requiring Shyamalan's office to formally approve each step. Neither the childhood accident nor the supposed rift with the filmmakers ever occurred. The hoax included a non-existent Sci-Fi publicist, "David Westover", whose name appeared on [[press releases]] regarding the special. Sci-Fi also fed false news stories to the [[Associated Press]]<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.today.com/id/5211084/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/profile-m-night-shyamalan-goes-sour/ |agency=[[Associated Press]] | work = [[Today (US TV show)|Today]]|date=16 June 2004 |title= Profile of M.

After an AP reporter confronted Sci-Fi Channel president [[Bonnie Hammer]] at a press conference, Hammer admitted the hoax, saying it was part of a [[guerrilla marketing]] campaign to generate pre-release [[publicity]] for ''The Village''.

We would never intend to offend the public or the press and we value our relationship with both."<ref name="APSciFi">{{cite news | last=Collins| first=Dan| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/20/entertainment/main630733.shtml | title=Sci-Fi Channel Admits Hoax, 'Documentary' On Reclusive Filmmaker Is Bogus| agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher= [[CBS News]]| date= July 20, 2004|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vca7jCUG| archivedate=January 10, 2011}}</ref>

==Criticism and controversy==

=== Shyamalan twists ===
With the exception of ''The Sixth Sense'' and ''Unbreakable'', a common criticism of Shyamalan's works is that they feature better direction than screenwriting.<ref name="thefreelibrary.com%60WATER%27+TORTURE+IS+M.+NIGHT+SHYAMALAN+A+GENIUS+OR+AN+EGOMANIAC%3F...-a0148492151">{{cite web |first=Glenn |last=Whip |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com%60WATER%27+TORTURE+IS+M.+NIGHT+SHYAMALAN+A+GENIUS+OR+AN+EGOMANIAC%3F...-a0148492151 |title=Water' torture is M. Night Shyamalan a genius of an egomaniac? Director's newest film has Gollywood wondering |publisher=dailybulletin.com |date=20 July 2006}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mediamythmakers.com/cgi-bin/rview.cgi?rm=mode2&type=review&name=TheVillage The Radford Reviews (2 August 2004)]</ref> He has also been labeled a "one-trick pony" for his continuous use of the "twist" element in his screenplays.<ref name="thefreelibrary.com%60WATER%27+TORTURE+IS+M.+NIGHT+SHYAMALAN+A+GENIUS+OR+AN+EGOMANIAC%3F...-a0148492151"/> After the release of ''The Village'', ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'''s Michael Agger noted that Shyamalan was following "an uncomfortable pattern" of "making fragile, sealed-off movies that fell apart when exposed to outside logic."<ref>{{cite web |publisher=slate.com |date=30 July 2004 |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2004/07/village_idiot.html |title=The case against M. Night Shyamalan}}</ref>

On a 31 May, 2008 interview with the London ''Independent,'' Shyamalan offered this answer to the question about his "one-trick" movies: "[A common misperception of me is] that all my movies have twist endings, or that they're all scary. All my movies are spiritual and all have an emotional perspective."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/the-5minute-interview-m-night-shyamalan-writer-and-director-837413.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=The 5-minute Interview: M Night Shyamalan, Writer and director | date=31 May 2008 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>

=== Plagiarism accusations===
Robert McIlhinney, a Pennsylvania screenwriter, sued Shyamalan in 2003, alleging similarity of ''Signs'' to his unpublished script ''Lord of the Barrens: The Jersey Devil''.<ref name="eonline.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b48011_shyamalans_village_villainy.html |publisher=eonline.com |title=Shyamalan's "Village" Villainy? |date= 10 August 2004 |first=Josh |last=Grossberg }}</ref><ref name="rediff.com">{{cite web |url=http://inhome.rediff.com/movies/2004/aug/11night.htm |title=Is Shyamalan a copycat? |publisher= Rediff Entertainment Bureau |date=11 August 2004}}</ref>

In 2004, [[Margaret Peterson Haddix]] noted that ''The Village'' has numerous similarities to her young adult's novel ''[[Running Out of Time (novel)|Running Out of Time]]'', prompting discussions with publisher Simon & Schuster about filing a lawsuit.<ref name="eonline.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b48011_shyamalans_village_villainy.html |publisher=eonline.com |title=Shyamalan's "Village" Villainy? |date= 10 August 2004 |first=Josh |last=Grossberg }}</ref><ref name="rediff.com">{{cite web |url=http://inhome.rediff.com/movies/2004/aug/11night.htm |title=Is Shyamalan a copycat? |publisher= Rediff Entertainment Bureau |date=11 August 2004}}</ref><ref name="ew.com">{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,679258,00.html |title=It Takes a Village |publisher=ew.com | first=Gary |last=Susman |date=10 August 2004}}</ref>

In response to both allegations, Disney and Shyamalan's production company Blinding Edge issued statements calling the claims "meritless".<ref name="ew.com"/>
