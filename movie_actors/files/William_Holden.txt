'''William Holden''' (April 17, 1918 &ndash; November 12, 1981) was an [[United States|American]] actor, who was one of the biggest box office draws of the 1950s. He won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in 1953 for his role in ''[[Stalag 17]]'', and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie|Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor]] for his role in the 1973 television film ''[[The Blue Knight (film)|The Blue Knight]]''.

Holden starred in some of Hollywood's most popular and critically acclaimed films, including such blockbusters as ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'', ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'', ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'', ''[[Picnic (1955 film)|Picnic]]'', ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'', and ''[[Network (film)|Network]]''. He was named one of the "Top 10 Stars of the Year" six times (1954–1958, 1961), and appeared on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years…100 Stars]] list as number 25.
{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Early life and career==
Holden was born '''William Franklin Beedle, Jr.''' in [[O'Fallon, Illinois]], the son of Mary Blanche ([[married and maiden names|née]] Ball; 1898-1990), a schoolteacher, and William Franklin Beedle, Sr. (1891-1967), an industrial [[chemist]].<ref name="ref1">[http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/williamh/index.html  "Ancestry of William Holden."] ''Genealogy.com.'' Retrieved: November 13, 2011.</ref> He had two younger brothers, Robert and Richard. Holden's paternal great-grandmother, Rebecca Westfield, was born in [[England]] in 1817, while some of his mother's ancestors settled in Virginia's [[Lancaster County, Virginia|Lancaster County]] after emigrating from [[England]] in the 17th century.<ref name="ref1"/> His younger brother, Robert W. "Bobbie" Beedle, became a U.S. Navy fighter pilot and was killed in action in [[World War II]], over [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], on January 5, 1944.

His family moved to [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]] when he was three. After graduating from [[South Pasadena High School]], Holden attended [[Pasadena City College|Pasadena Junior College]], where he became involved in local radio plays.  Contrary to legend and theatre publicity, he did not study at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]], nor was he discovered in a play there. Rather, he was spotted by a talent scout from [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1937 while playing the part of an 80-year-old man, [[Marie Curie]]'s father-in-law, in a play at the Playbox, a separate and private theatre owned by Pasadena Playhouse director Gilmor Brown. His first film role was in ''Prison Farm'' the following year. 

A version of how of he obtained his stage name "Holden" is based on a statement by George Ross of ''Billboard magazine'': "William Holden, the lad just signed for the coveted lead in “Golden Boy”, used to be Bill Beadle. And here is how he obtained his new movie tag. On the Columbia lot is an assistant director and scout named Harold Winston ([[Harold A. Winston]]). Not long ago he was divorced from the actress, [[Gloria Holden]], but carried the torch after the marital rift. Winston was one of those who discovered the “Golden Boy” newcomer and who renamed him — in honor of his former spouse! ..."<ref>Ross, George.

Holden's first starring role was in ''[[Golden Boy (film)|Golden Boy]]'' (1939), in which he played a [[violin]]ist-turned-[[Boxing|boxer]].  Next he starred with [[George Raft]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]] in the [[Warner Bros.]] gangster epic ''[[Invisible Stripes]]'' later the same year, followed by the role of George Gibbs in the film adaptation of ''[[Our Town (1940 film)|Our Town]]''.<ref>Capua 2010, pp. 16–17.</ref>  After [[Columbia Pictures]] picked up half of his contract, he alternated between starring in several minor pictures for Paramount and Columbia before serving as a 2nd lieutenant in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during World War II, where he acted in training films for the [[First Motion Picture Unit]]. Beginning in 1950, his career took off when [[Billy Wilder]] tapped him to star as the down-at-the-heels screenwriter Joe Gillis, who is taken in by faded silent-screen star Norma Desmond ([[Gloria Swanson]]) in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', for which Holden earned his first Best Actor Oscar nomination.<ref>Capua 2010, pp. 54–55.</ref>

Following this breakthrough film, his career quickly grew in stature as Holden played a series of roles that combined good looks with cynical detachment, including a prisoner-of-war entrepreneur in ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), for which he won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], a pressured young engineer/family man in ''[[Executive Suite]]'' (1954), an acerbic stage director in ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' (1954) with [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Grace Kelly]], a conflicted jet pilot in the Korean War film ''[[The Bridges at Toko-Ri]]'' (1954), a wandering college football star in ''[[Picnic (1955 film)|Picnic]]'' (1955), a dashing war correspondent in ''[[Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (film)|Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing]]'' (1955), his most widely recognized role as an ill-fated prisoner in ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957) with [[Alec Guinness]], a World War II tug boat captain in ''[[The Key (1958 film)|The Key]]'' (1958), and an American Civil War military surgeon in [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Horse Soldiers]]'' (1959) opposite [[John Wayne]].

Holden also played a number of sunnier roles in light comedy, such as the handsome architect pursuing virginal [[Maggie McNamara]] in the controversial [[Production Code]]-breaking ''[[The Moon Is Blue]]'' (1953) with [[David Niven]], as [[Judy Holliday]]'s tutor in ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]'' (1950), as a playwright captivated by [[Ginger Rogers]]' character in ''[[Forever Female]]'' (1953) and as [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s younger brother, a carefree playboy, in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954), which also starred [[Audrey Hepburn]]. In 1954, Holden was featured on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.

On February 7, 1955, Holden appeared as a guest star on ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' as himself. His career peaked in 1957 with the enormous success of ''The Bridge on the River Kwai'', but Holden spent the next several years starring in a number of films that rarely succeeded commercially or critically.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000034/filmorate "Film Ratings."] ''IMDb.'' Retrieved: December 6, 2012.</ref>  By the mid-1960s, the quality of his roles and films had noticeably diminished.  A heavy drinker most of his life, Holden descended into alcoholism in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Later career==
In 1969, Holden made a comeback when he starred in director [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s graphically violent Western ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'', winning much acclaim. Also in 1969, Holden starred in director [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]]'s family film ''[[The Christmas Tree (1969 film)|L'Arbre de Noël]]'', co-starring Italian actress [[Virna Lisi]], based on the novel of the same name by Michel Bataille. This film was originally released in the United States as ''The Christmas Tree'' and on home video as ''When Wolves Cry.''<ref>Capua 2010, pp. 135–136, 141.</ref>

For television roles in 1974, Holden won a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie]] for his portrayal of a cynical, tough veteran [[LAPD]] street cop in the television film ''[[The Blue Knight (film)|The Blue Knight]]'', based upon the best-selling [[Joseph Wambaugh]] novel of the same name.

Also in 1974, Holden starred with [[Paul Newman]] and [[Steve McQueen]] in the critically acclaimed disaster film ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'', which became a box office smash and one of the highest grossing films of Holden's career. 

Two years later he was praised for his Oscar-nominated leading performance in [[Sidney Lumet]]'s classic ''[[Network (film)|Network]]'' (1976), a prescient examination of the media written by [[Paddy Chayefsky]], playing an older version of the character type he had become iconic for in the 1950s, only now more jaded and aware of his own mortality.

In 1980, Holden appeared in ''[[The Earthling]]'' with popular child actor [[Ricky Schroder]], playing a loner dying of cancer who goes to the [[Australia]]n [[outback]] to end his days, meets a young boy whose parents have been killed in an accident, and teaches him how to survive. During his last years, Holden also appeared in his second [[Irwin Allen]] film, ''[[When Time Ran Out]]'', a critical and commercial failure and heavily disliked by Holden himself; his final film, [[Blake Edwards]]'s ''[[S.O.B. (film)|S.O.B.]]'', was more successful and a [[Golden Globe]]-nominated picture.

In 1981 Holden was offered the role of Coach Daniel B. Delaney in ''[[That Championship Season (1982 film)|That Championship Season]]''. He became very depressed when filming was delayed until 1982, and drank even more heavily.<ref>Capua 2010, pp. 162–163.</ref>

While in Italy in 1966, Holden killed another driver in a drunk driving incident. He received an eight-month suspended sentence for vehicular manslaughter.<ref>Brown, Andrew M.

Holden maintained a home in [[Switzerland]] and also spent much of his time working for [[wildlife conservation]] as a managing partner in an animal preserve in [[Africa]]. His [[Kenya|Mount Kenya Safari Club]] in [[Nanyuki]] (founded 1959) became a mecca for the international [[jet set]].<ref name="Bennett"/>On a trip to Africa, he fell in love with the wildlife and became increasingly concerned with the animal species that were beginning to decrease in population. With the help of his partners, he created the Mount Kenya Game Ranch and inspired the creation of the William Holden Wildlife Foundation. <ref>[http://www.animalorphanagekenya.org/what-we-do/wildlife-education/ "The William Holden Wildlife Education Center."] ''Mount Kenya Wilderness Conservancy'', 2015.

===Marriage and relationships===
Holden was married to actress Ardis Ankerson (stage name [[Brenda Marshall]]) from 1941 until their divorce (after many long separations) in 1971. They had two sons, Peter "West" Westfield (born November 17, 1943; died June, 2014) and Scott Porter (born May 2, 1946; died January 21, 2005, San Diego, California). He also adopted his wife's daughter, Virginia, from her first marriage. William was also a distant cousin to news anchor and game show panelist, the late [[John Cameron Swayze]] through the family of 17th century British judge Samuel Swayze.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0842027/ "John Cameron Swayze (1906–1995)."] ''IMDb''. Retrieved: January 24, 2015.</ref>

Holden was best man at the marriage of his friend [[Ronald Reagan]] to [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy Davis]] in 1952; however, he never involved himself in politics.

During the filming of ''Sabrina'' (1954), [[Audrey Hepburn]] and the already-married William Holden became romantically involved. She hoped to marry him and have children, but she broke off the relationship when Holden revealed that he had undergone a [[vasectomy]].

Holden met French actress [[Capucine]] in the early 1960s.  The two starred in the films ''[[The Lion#Movie adaption|The Lion]]'' (1962) and ''[[The 7th Dawn]]'' (1964). They began a two-year affair, which is alleged to have ended due to Holden's alcoholism.<ref>Osborne, Robert (host). "The Lion". ''Turner Classic Movies'', air date: November 4, 2012.</ref> Capucine and Holden remained friends until his death in 1981.<ref>Strodder 2000, p. 112.</ref>

In 1972, Holden began a nine-year relationship with actress [[Stefanie Powers]], which sparked her interest in animal welfare.<ref>Capua 2010, p. 165.</ref> After his death, Powers set up the [[William Holden Wildlife Foundation]] at Holden's Mount Kenya Game Ranch.<ref>Bacon, Doris Klein.

===Death===
According to the Los Angeles County Coroner's autopsy report, Holden was alone and intoxicated in his apartment in [[Santa Monica, California]], on November 12, 1981, when he slipped on a rug, severely lacerated his forehead on a teak bedside table, and bled to death. Evidence suggests he was conscious for at least half an hour after the fall.  It is probable that he may not have realized the severity of the injury and did not summon aid, or was unable to call for help. His body was found four days later.<ref name="Bennett">Bennett, Bruce.

Holden had dictated in his will that the [[Service_Corporation_International#Brands|Neptune Society]] cremate him and scatter his ashes in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. No funeral or memorial service was held, in accordance with his wishes.<ref>Capua 2010, p. 164</ref>

For his contribution to the film industry, William Holden has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] located at 1651 Vine Street.<ref>[http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/william-holden/ "Hollywood Star Walk: William Holden."]  ''Los Angeles Times'', March 26, 2013.</ref> He also has a star on the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement "St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees."] ''St. Louis Walk of Fame''.

Holden makes a cameo appearance in [[Walker Percy|Walker Percy's]] 1961 novel "[[The Moviegoer]]". Percy's hero, Binx Bolling, encounters the star in the French Quarter: "Today I am in luck.

<!----In a podcast for Turner Classic Movies (February 2012) singer-songwriter [[Suzanne Vega]] revealed that years after she had released her famous song "[[Tom's Diner]]", she was told that her line from this song ("''I open up the paper, there's a story of an actor who had died while he was drinking, it was no one I had heard of''") actually referred to William Holden, and that "You can date Tom's Diner day by the date of his death". {{YouTube|4mY1GZJZthQ}}

In the film ''Mona Lisa Smile'', students gossip about an affair between their professor Katherine Watson, a California native, and William Holden.
