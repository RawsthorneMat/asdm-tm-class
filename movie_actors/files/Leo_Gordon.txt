'''Leo Vincent Gordon''' (December 2, 1922 - December 26, 2000) was an [[United States|American]] [[film]] and [[television]] [[character actor]] as well as a [[screenplay]] [[writer]] and [[novelist]]. During more than 40 years in film and television, he was frequently cast as a supporting actor playing brutish bad guys.<ref name="MAG">Magers, Boyd, ''[http://www.westernclippings.com/heavies/leogordon_charactersheavies.shtml Characters and Heavies]'', westernclippings.com, retrieved 1 December 2012</ref>

==Early life and career==
Gordon was born in [[Brooklyn]] in [[New York City]] on December 2, 1922. Reared by his father in dire poverty, Gordon grew up during the [[Great Depression]]. He left school in the eighth grade, went to work in construction and demolition, and then joined the [[New Deal]] agency, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], in which he participated in various public works projects.<ref name="MAG"/> After the United States entered [[World War II]] in 1941, Gordon enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]], in which he served for two years and received an undesirable discharge.<ref name="MAG"/> Gordon was in southern [[California]] where he and a cohort attempted to rob a bar and its patrons with a pistol. He was shot in the stomach by one of the patrons.<ref>p.178 Lewis, C. Jack ''White Horse, Black Hat: A Quarter Century on Hollywood's Poverty Row'' Rowman & Littlefield, 2002</ref> He was arrested for [[armed robbery]] and served five years in [[San Quentin Prison]], where he furthered his education by reading nearly every book in the library.<ref name="MAG"/>

Gordon took advantage of the benefits accorded him as part of the [[G.I. Bill]] and began taking acting lessons at the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] (ADA).<ref name="MAG"/> During his time at the ADA, Gordon was enrolled with several future screen legends including [[Grace Kelly]] and [[Anne Bancroft]]. For a time, [[Jason Robards]], later a two-time [[Academy Award]] winner, was Gordon's instructor. It was here that he also met his future wife, [[Lynn Cartwright]], who would have a sporadic but lengthy career as a [[character actor]], mainly in television. They were married in 1950 and remained together until his death a half century later. They had one child, a daughter named Tara.

==Actor in film and television==
Gordon started his career on the stage and worked with such luminaries as [[Edward G. Robinson]] and [[Tyrone Power]]. He was soon discovered by a [[Hollywood]] agent in a [[Los Angeles]] production of ''[[Darkness at Noon]]''. Over the course of his career, Gordon would appear in more than 170 film and television productions from the early 1950s to the mid-1990s.<ref name="MAG"/>

In 1954, Gordon portrayed the outlaw [[Bill Doolin]], a native [[Arkansas|Arkansan]] who founded the [[Wild Bunch]] gang and operated primarily in [[Kansas]], in the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]], ''[[Stories of the Century]]'', starring and narrated by [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0710966/|title="The Doolin Gang" on ''Stories of the Century'', June 10, 1954|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=December 17, 2012}}</ref>

In 1955, Gordon was cast on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] religion [[anthology series]], ''[[Crossroads (1955 TV series)|Crossroads]]'', in the role of Sergeant Leroy in "All My Love". In 1958, he appeared as Joe Brock in the episode "Desert Fury" of [[CBS]]'s ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'' children's program.<ref name="IMDb"/> That same year we was cast as Zip Wyatt in "Three Wanted Men" of [[Rex Allen]]'s syndicated western series, ''[[Frontier Doctor]]''. He also played as gunslinging professional killer in the pilot for the television version of ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' but many changes were later instituted in the series, such as the marshal's office and Long Branch Saloon looking markedly different and the relationship between Matt Dillon and Kitty being subtly more formal as well, so the episode was buried deep in the season in the hope that viewers would not notice, which apparently worked.

Gordon was often cast to make the most of his 6'2" (189&nbsp;cm) height, intense features, deep menacing voice, and icy stare. He had radiant light blue eyes. One of his earliest films was ''[[Riot in Cell Block 11]]'', shot at San Quentin.
<ref name="IMDb">''[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330388/ Leo Gordon]'', retrieved 1 December 2012</ref>  The film's director, [[Don Siegel]], who worked with such screen tough guys as [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[John Wayne]], related that "Leo Gordon was the scariest man I have ever met".<ref name="IMDb"/>

Other notable roles included that of [[John Dillinger]] in Siegel's ''[[Baby Face Nelson (film)|Baby Face Nelson]]'', opposite [[Mickey Rooney]] as the crazed protagonist.<ref name="IMDb"/>  Gordon may be most noted for his recurring character [[List of Maverick episodes|Big Mike McComb]] on the ABC/[[Warner Brothers]] western television series, ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', working from 1957 to 1960 alongside [[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]]. He appeared in the much remembered episode "[[Shady Deal at Sunny Acres]]". Garner later recalled in his videotaped interview for the [[Archive of American Television]] that Gordon purposely punched him for real in one of their first scenes together and that Garner hit him back when filming the next scene. Garner and Gordon reunited in the 1970s when Gordon appeared as a dimwitted bodyguard on four episodes of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Rockford Files]]''.<ref name="IMDb"/>

Gordon appeared in multiple roles on [[Robert Stack]]'s 1959 ABC crime drama, ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]''.<ref name="IMDb"/> Gordon also guest starred on the ABC/WB western series, ''[[The Alaskans]]'' opposite [[Roger Moore]]. He was cast as Damian in the 1961 episode "Million Dollar Suit" of the ABC/WB crime drama, ''[[The Roaring 20s (TV series)|The Roaring 20s]].'' He also appeared on the NBC western series, ''[[Empire (1962 TV series)|Empire]]'' and ''[[Laredo (TV series)|Laredo]]''.

One of Gordon's best-remembered television appearances on CBS's ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' in the episode "High Noon in Mayberry," in which he portrays an ex-convict who appears destined for revenge against [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Sheriff Andy Taylor]] of fictitious Mayberry. The screenwriters for the episode, Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum, borrowed heavily from Gordon's brief criminal career and subsequent incarceration in order to supplement the role.<ref>Beck, Ken and Clark, Jim, ''The Andy Griffith Show Book'', New York: St. Martin's Press (1985), ISBN 0312262876, p. 156.</ref>

Perhaps Gordon's single most memorable film scene occurred in ''[[McLintock!]]'' (1963), during which [[John Wayne]] knocks him down a long mudslide after uttering the famous line "Somebody oughta belt you but I won't! I won't!  The hell I won't."  Another notable role was in the 1966 western ''[[The Night of the Grizzly]]'' opposite [[Clint Walker]], one of the very few actors who could match Gordon's intense screen presence regarding physical size and strength.  Gordon played bounty hunter Cass Dowdy, who would, as one character said: "...hunt anything for a price, man or animal.", but who had a soft spot for his enemy's son.  Somehow, Gordon managed to make his character as sympathetic as he was frightening, and gives his life to save the boy in his final scene.

Gordon portrayed sympathetic parts when called upon to do so, including his performances in the western ''[[Black Patch (film)|Black Patch]]'' (1957), a film which he wrote, and in [[Roger Corman]]'s [[civil rights]] drama ''[[The Intruder (1962 film)|The Intruder]]'' (1962), opposite a young [[William Shatner]]. He also appeared as aging wrestler Milo Stavroupolis in NBC's ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', starring [[Michael Landon]].

Gordon's final role was as [[Wyatt Earp]] in a 1994 episode of the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]''. He also appeared in the film ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'' that same year with [[Mel Gibson]], [[Jodie Foster]] and [[James Garner]].

==Screenwriter and novelist==
Gordon also wrote scripts for television episodes and movies, sometimes writing himself a good role. Frequently billed as "Leo V. Gordon," he wrote dozens of scripts that would later become movies or television episodes, including popular shows such as NBC's ''[[Adam-12]]''. His first successful film script, ''[[The Cry Baby Killer]]'', featured a young and unknown [[Jack Nicholson]]. Among the most notable feature films he wrote were ''[[You Can't Win 'Em All]]'' (1970) starring [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Charles Bronson]] and ''[[Tobruk (1967 film)|Tobruk]]'' (1967) starring [[Rock Hudson]] and [[George Peppard]] and directed by [[Arthur Hiller]], in which he appeared as Sergeant Krug. In addition to film and television scripts, Gordon also wrote several novels, including the historical Western "Powderkeg."

As a screen writer, he wrote nearly fifty scripts apiece for ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'', and ''Maverick'', in the episodes in which he was not a guest star. In the 1970s, he would frequently appear on the popular police drama ''[[Adam-12]]'', another show that he often scripted. Gordon told an interviewer that because of his imposing size, he never felt he was fully accepted as a screenwriter: "Writing is more rewarding than acting, but look at my face. Nobody believes I’m a writer. I should be 5' 8", 142 pounds, wear patches on my elbows and horn-rimmed glasses and smoke a pipe. That’s a writer!"<ref name="MAG" />

==Later life and persona==
In contrast to his screen persona, Gordon was a quiet, thoughtful and intelligent man who generally avoided the Hollywood spotlight.<ref name="IMDb"/> He was widely regarded by his fellow actors and his directors as a well-prepared professional.<ref name="IMDb"/> In 1997, he received the [[Golden Boot Awards|Golden Boot Award]] for his many years of work in westerns. In accepting the award, the actor simply flashed a smile for his fans and remarked, "Thank God for typecasting!"

After struggling with a brief illness, Gordon died of cardiac failure in his sleep at age 78 at his Los Angeles home. His and his wife's ashes are interred at the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.
