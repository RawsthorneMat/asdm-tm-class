===1976–1993===
After leaving the university, Neeson returned to Ballymena where he worked in a variety of casual jobs, from a fork-lift operator at Guinness to a [[truck driver]]. He also attended teacher training college for two years in Newcastle upon Tyne, before again returning to his hometown. In 1976, Neeson joined the [[Lyric Players' Theatre]] in Belfast where he performed for two years. He got his first film experience in 1977, playing Jesus Christ and Evangelist in the religious film ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]''. Neeson moved to [[Dublin]] in 1978 after he was offered a part in Ron Hutchinson's ''Says I, Says He'', a drama about [[The Troubles]], at the [[Project Arts Centre]]. He acted in several other Project productions and joined the [[Abbey Theatre]] (the National Theatre of Ireland).

In 1980, filmmaker [[John Boorman]] saw him on stage as Lennie Small in ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' and offered him the role of [[Sir Gawain]] in the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] film, ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]''. After ''Excalibur'', Neeson moved to London, where he continued working on stage, in small budget films and in television. He lived with the actress [[Helen Mirren]] at this time, whom he met working on ''Excalibur''.<ref name="elle">{{cite web|title=Neeson Easy: Tall, Dark and Phantom|work=Elle (UK)|last=McHugh|first=Fionnuala|date=September 1988}}</ref> Between 1982 and 1987, Neeson starred in five films; most notably alongside [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]] in 1984's ''[[The Bounty]]'' and [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Jeremy Irons]] in 1986's ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]''.

In 1990, he followed this with a starring role in [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Darkman]]''. Although the film was successful, Neeson's subsequent years would not bring him the same recognition. In 1993, he joined ''Ellis Island'' co-star and future wife [[Natasha Richardson]] in the Broadway play ''[[Anna Christie]]''. They also worked together in ''[[Nell (film)|Nell]]'', released the following year.

In 1999, Neeson starred as [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] in ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]''.

In 2010, Neeson voiced the character [[Aslan]] again in the sequel ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]''. Later, he stated, "Aslan symbolises a Christlike figure, but he also symbolises for me Mohammed, Buddha and all the great spiritual leaders and prophets over the centuries"; this disappointed many fans of the series, who felt that he was "destroying the author's legacy to be politically correct".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1335586/Liam-Neeson-upsets-Narnia-fans-claiming-Aslan-Mohammed-Christ.html?ITO=1490|title=Narnia fans' fury after Liam Neeson claims Aslan – the symbol of Christ – could also be Mohammed|location=London|work=Daily Mail|first1=Tamara|last1=Cohen|first2=Simon|last2=Caldwell|date=4 December 2010}}</ref><ref>The Collected Letters of C.S.
