==Early life==
Born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] into a family of stock theater and [[vaudeville]] performers, Blanche Sweet entered the entertainment industry at an early age. At age 4 she toured in a play called ''[[The Battle of the Strong]]'' whose star was stage luminary [[Maurice Barrymore]]. A decade later Sweet would act with Barrymore's son [[Lionel Barrymore|Lionel]] in a [[D. W. Griffith]] directed film.<ref>''Great Times, Good Times: The Odyssey of Maurice Barrymore" by James Kotsilibas Davis c.1977</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pratt|first1=George C.|title=The Blonde Telegrapher:  Blanche Sweet|journal=Image|date=March 1975|volume=18|issue=1|pages=21–23|url=http://image.eastmanhouse.org/files/GEH_1975_18_01.pdf|publisher=International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House Inc.|location=Rochester, N.Y.}}</ref>  In 1909, she started work at [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph Studios]] under contract to director  D. W. Griffith. By 1910 she had become a rival to [[Mary Pickford]], who had also started for Griffith the year before.

==Rise to stardom==
Sweet was known for her energetic, independent roles, at variance with the 'ideal' Griffith type of vulnerable, often fragile, femininity. After many starring roles, her first real landmark film was the 1911 Griffith thriller ''[[The Lonedale Operator]]''. In 1913 she starred in Griffith's first [[feature film|feature-length]] film, ''[[Judith of Bethulia]]''. In 1914 Sweet was initially cast by Griffith in the part of Elsie Stoneman in his epic ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' but the role was eventually given to rival actress [[Lillian Gish]], who was Sweet's senior by three years. That same year Sweet parted ways with Griffith and joined [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] (then Famous Players-Lasky) for the much higher pay that studio was able to afford.

Throughout the 1910s, Sweet continued her career appearing in a number of highly prominent roles in films and remained a publicly popular leading lady. She often starred in vehicles by [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and [[Marshall Neilan]], and she was recognised by leading film critics of the time to be one of the foremost actresses of the entire silent era. It was during her time working with Neilan that the two began a publicized affair, which brought on his divorce from former actress [[Gertrude Bambrick]]. Sweet and Neilan married in 1922. The union ended in 1929 with Sweet charging that Neilan was a persistent adulterer.<ref>"Blanche Sweet Sues Neilan for Divorce", ''The New York Times'', Sept. 24, 1929, p. 28.</ref><ref>"Decree to Blanche Sweet". ''The New York Times'', Oct. 22, 1929, p. 60.</ref>

During the early 1920s Sweet's career continued to prosper, and she starred in the first film version of ''[[Anna Christie (1923 film)|Anna Christie]]'' in 1923. The film is also notable as being the first [[Eugene O'Neill]] play to be made into a motion picture. In successive years, she starred in ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles (1924 film)|Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' and ''[[The Sporting Venus]]'', both directed by Neilan. Sweet soon began a new career phase as one of the newly formed MGM studio's biggest stars.

==Sound film and later career==
As the [[Roaring Twenties]] wound down, Sweet's career faltered with the advent of [[talkies]]. Sweet made just three talking pictures, including her critically lauded performance in 1930's ''[[Show Girl in Hollywood]]'', before retiring from the screen that same year and marrying stage actor [[Raymond Hackett]] in 1935.<ref>"Blanche Sweet Rewed", ''The New York Times'', Oct. 12, 1935, p. 13.</ref> The marriage lasted until Hackett's death in 1958.

Sweet spent the remainder of her performing career in radio and in secondary [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage roles. Eventually, her career in both of these fields petered out, and she began working in a [[Los Angeles]] department store. In the late 1960s, her acting legacy was resurrected when film scholars invited her to [[Europe]] to receive recognition for her work.

On September 24, 1984, a tribute to Blanche Sweet was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Miss Sweet introduced her 1925 film, ''The Sporting Venus.''

==Death==
Sweet died in [[New York City]] of a [[stroke]], on September 6, 1986, just weeks after her 90th birthday. Her ashes were later scattered at the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens.
