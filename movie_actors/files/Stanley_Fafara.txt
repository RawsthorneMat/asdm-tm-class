==Early life and career==

Fafara remained with ''Leave It To Beaver'' for six years.<ref name=Chance2011>{{cite book |author=Norman Chance |title=Who Was Who on TV |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dqLRaPDcbTgC&pg=PA290 |year=2011 |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |isbn=978-1-4568-2164-7|page=290}}</ref> After the show's cancellation in 1963, he attended [[North Hollywood High School]].

At his parents' instigation, Fafara went to live with his sister in [[Jamaica]], where he tried his hand at painting; however, he continued to drink and use narcotics.

Fafara was sentenced to a year in jail after being arrested and convicted for an eighth burglary. After his release from jail, Fafara tried several jobs but eventually returned to dealing drugs.<ref name=LATimesObit/>

Fafara later developed an addiction [[heroin]] and was in and out of rehabilitation centers for many years. He became sober in 1995.<ref name=LATimesObit/>
