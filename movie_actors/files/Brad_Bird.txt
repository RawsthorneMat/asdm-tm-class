'''Phillip Bradley''' "'''Brad'''" '''Bird''' (born September 24, 1957) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, and actor, who began his career as an animator.

Bird developed a love for the art of animation at an early age and was mentored by [[Milt Kahl]], one of [[Disney]]'s legendary [[Nine Old Men]]. He was part of one of the earliest graduating classes of the [[California Institute of the Arts]] alongside [[John Lasseter]] and [[Tim Burton]]. Afterwards, Bird worked as an animator for Disney and wrote the screenplay for ''[[Batteries Not Included]]'' (1987). Bird served as a creative consultant on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' during its first eight seasons, where he helped develop the show's animation style.

Afterwards, Bird left to direct his first animated feature, ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999), which fared poorly at the box office but came to be regarded as a modern animated classic. He rejoined Lasseter at [[Pixar]] in 2000, where he would develop his second picture, ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004), and his third picture, ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'' (2007). Both films place among Pixar's highest-grossing features and gave Bird two [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] wins and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] nominations. 

In 2011, Bird transitioned to live-action filmmaking with ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]'', which became the highest-grossing of its franchise. His latest film, ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'', starring [[George Clooney]], was released in May 2015.

==Early life==
Bird was born in [[Kalispell, Montana|Kalispell]], Montana, the youngest of four children<ref name=Tribute>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0083348/bio|title=Brad Bird – Director Bio|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref> of Marjorie A. (née Cross) and Philip Cullen Bird. His father worked in the [[propane]] business, and his grandfather, Francis Wesley "Frank" Bird, who was born in [[County Sligo|County Sligo, Ireland]], was a president and chief executive of the [[Montana Power Company]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3668253/Ratatouille-Year-of-the-rat.html|title=Ratatouille: Year of the rat|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Jessica|last=Berens|date=September 29, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/celeb/bradbird.htm|title=Brad Bird ancestry |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=August 15, 2012}}</ref><ref name=bird>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyinterlake.com/news/local_montana/article_f1f5632d-e179-5b34-934e-3368a3adaeae.html|title =Kalispell Native is the Superhero Behind "The Incredibles"|newspaper=Daily Inter Lake|last=Gaiser|first=Heidi|date = November 12, 2004|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}</ref> On a tour of the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] at age&nbsp;11, he announced that someday he would become part of its animation team, and soon afterward began work on his own 15-minute animated short. Within two years, Bird had completed his animation, which impressed the cartoon company. By age&nbsp;14, barely in high school, Bird was mentored by the animator [[Milt Kahl]], one of Disney's legendary [[Disney's Nine Old Men|Nine Old Men]]. Bird recalls Kahl's criticisms as ideal: Kahl would point out shortcomings by gently delivering thoughts on where Bird could improve. After graduating from [[Corvallis High School (Oregon)|Corvallis High School]] in [[Corvallis, Oregon]] in 1975, Bird took a three-year break. He was then awarded a scholarship by Disney to attend [[California Institute of the Arts]], where he met and befriended another future animator, Pixar co-founder and director [[John Lasseter]].<ref name=Tribute/>

==Career==
Upon graduating from the California Institute of the Arts, Bird began working for Disney. His tenure with Disney was brief, and he left the company shortly after working on ''[[The Fox and the Hound (film)|The Fox and the Hound]]'' in 1981.

He next worked on animated television series, with much shorter lead times. He was the creator (writer, director, and co-producer) of the ''Family Dog'' episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''. In addition, Bird co-wrote the screenplay for the live-action film ''[[Batteries Not Included (film)|Batteries Not Included]]''. In 1989, Bird joined [[Klasky Csupo]], where he helped to develop ''[[The Simpsons]]'' from one-minute shorts on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' into a series of half-hour programs. In 1990, he directed the episode "[[Krusty Gets Busted]]" (which marked the first speaking role of [[Sideshow Bob]]) and co-directed the Season Three episode "[[Like Father, Like Clown]]." He served as an executive consultant for the show for its first eight seasons. Also while at Klasky Csupo, he was one of the animators of the ''[[Rugrats]]'' pilot "[[Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing]]."  He worked on several other animated television series, including ''[[The Critic]]'' and ''[[King of the Hill (TV series)|King of the Hill]]'', before pitching [[Warner Brothers]] to write and direct the animated film ''[[The Iron Giant]]''. Despite receiving near-universal acclaim from critics, it failed at the box office domestically, but grossed $103 million worldwide, making it at least a moderate box office success. The film impressed his old friend [[John Lasseter]], founder of the computer-animation pioneer [[Pixar]]. Bird pitched the idea for ''[[The Incredibles]]'' to Pixar. In the finished picture, Bird also provides the voice of costume designer [[Edna Mode]].<ref name=Tribute/> As an inside joke, the character Syndrome was based on Bird's likeness (as was Mr. Incredible) and according to him, he did not realize the joke until the movie was too far into production to have it changed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brad Bird|title=Not My Job: NPR|work=Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!|date=January 19, 2008|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18236424|accessdate=January 27, 2009}}</ref> The film became both a major critical and financial success. As a result, Bird won his first [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], and his screenplay was nominated for [[Academy Award For Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].<ref name=bird2>{{cite web|title=Brad Bird|work=Montana Kids|publisher=Montana Office of Tourism|url=http://montanakids.com/cool_stories/famous_montanans/bird.htm|accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Bradbird.jpg|thumb|upright|Brad Bird with his second [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]]]

In the middle of 2005, Bird was asked by the Pixar management team to take over ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'' from its previous director [[Jan Pinkava]]. This change was announced in March 2006, during a presentation at a Disney shareholders meeting. The film was released in 2007; like ''The Incredibles'', the film was another critical and box office success. In January 2008, ''Ratatouille'' won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film|Best Animated Feature]] award at the [[Golden Globes]]; it was also nominated for 5 Academy Awards, including Best Animated Feature and [[Best Original Screenplay]]. On February 24, 2008, ''Ratatouille'' won Bird his second [[Academy Award]] for Best Animated Feature Film.<ref name=bird2/>

Bird has spoken passionately about animation as an art form. When Bird and producer [[John Walker (movie producer)|John Walker]] recorded the Director's Commentary for ''The Incredibles''{{'}} DVD, he jokingly offered to punch the next person that he heard call animation a genre instead of an art form. Bird believes animation can be used to tell any kind of story – drama or comedy, for an adult audience or children.

Before he was sidetracked by ''Ratatouille'', Bird began work on a film adaptation of [[James Dalessandro]]'s novel ''1906'', which would be his first live-action project.<ref>{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Utichi|title=Brad Bird Takes RT Through Ratatouille|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=October 26, 2007|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/ratatouille/news/1683760/exclusive_brad_bird_takes_rt_through_ratatouille|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}</ref> In March 2008, Bird resumed work on the film, which is a co-production between Pixar and Warner Bros. The novel, narrated by reporter Annalisa Passarelli, examines police officers battling corruption in the government that causes the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] to turn into such a disaster. The script was co-written by [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Sciretta|title=Pixar teams with Warner Bros for Brad Bird's 1906|work=[[/Film]]|date=March 13, 2008|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/03/13/brad-bird-teams-with-pixar-and-warner-bros-for-1906/|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}</ref> Blogger Jim Hill suggested the film has been on hold due to Disney / Pixar and Warner Bros.' nervousness over the projected $200&nbsp;million budget.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_hilll/archive/2009/02/10/watch-this-space-jhm-s-nycc-coverage-coming-up-soon.aspx|first=Jim|last=Hill|title="Incredibles" sequel is stalled until Bird can get "1906" off the ground|work=Jim Hill Media|date=February 10, 2009|accessdate=February 11, 2009}}</ref> In May 2010, with ''[[1906 (film)|1906]]'' apparently still stalled, Bird signed on as the director of ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]'', produced by [[Tom Cruise]] and [[J.

Bird directed and co-wrote Disney's science fiction film ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]'' (2015),<ref>{{cite news|title=Brad Bird's 1952 is Now Tomorrowland|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=99449|accessdate=January 28, 2013|newspaper=ComingSoon.net|date=January 28, 2013|ref=Tomorrowland}}</ref> whose screenplay was co-written with [[Damon Lindelof]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/brad-bird-1952/163826/ | author=Chitwood, Adam | title=Brad Bird to Direct Disney's Large-Scale Mystery Film 1952, Written by Damon Lindelof | publisher=''[[Collider]]'' | accessdate=May 3, 2012 | date=May 3, 2012}}</ref> On March 18, 2014, it was announced that Bird is writing and directing a sequel to ''The Incredibles''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Graser|first=Marc|title=Disney Plans Third 'Cars,' ‘The Incredibles 2′|url=http://variety.com/2014/film/news/disney-plans-third-cars-the-incredibles-2-movies-1201137824/|accessdate=March 18, 2014|newspaper=Variety|date=March 18, 2014}}</ref>
