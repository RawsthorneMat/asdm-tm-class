'''Ingrid Bergman''' (29 August 1915{{spaced ndash}}29 August 1982) was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] actress who starred in a variety of [[List of European films|European]] and [[List of American films|American films]].<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 1 September 1982.</ref> She won three [[Academy Awards]], two [[Emmy Award]]s, four [[Golden Globe Award]]s and the [[Tony Award]] for [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play|Best Actress]]. She is ranked as the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|fourth greatest female star]] of American cinema of all time by the [[American Film Institute]]. She is best remembered for her roles as Ilsa Lund in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942), and as Alicia Huberman in ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), an [[Alfred Hitchcock]] thriller co-starring [[Cary Grant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|work=[[American Film Institute]]|accessdate=2006-10-23|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061020084914/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx|archivedate=2006-10-20}}</ref>

Before becoming a star in American films, she had been a leading actress in Swedish films. Her first introduction to U.S. audiences came with her starring role in the English-language remake of ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' in 1939. In the United States, she brought to the screen a "Nordic freshness and vitality", along with exceptional beauty and intelligence, and according to the ''[[St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture]]'', she quickly became "the ideal of American womanhood" and one of Hollywood's greatest leading actresses.<ref name=James>''St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture'', St. James Press, Gale Publishing (2000)<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>

After her performance in [[Victor Fleming]]'s remake of ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' in 1941, she was noticed by her future producer [[David O. Selznick]], who called her "the most completely conscientious actress" he had ever worked with. He started her with a one-film role at her insistence, then signed a four-film contract (also at her insistence) rather than the typical seven-year acting contracts typically signed with foreign actors at that time, thereby supporting her continued success. A few of her other starring roles, besides ''Casablanca'', included ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945), [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949), and the independent production ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948).<ref name="imdb">{{IMDb name|6}}</ref>

In 1950, after a decade of stardom in American films, she starred in the [[Italian films|Italian film]] ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'', which led to a love affair with director [[Roberto Rossellini]] while they were both already married. The affair and then marriage with Rossellini created a scandal in the US that forced her to remain in Europe until 1956, when she made a successful Hollywood return in ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'', for which she won her second Academy Award, as well as the forgiveness of her US fans. Many of her personal and film documents can be seen in the [[Wesleyan University]] Cinema Archives.<ref>[http://www.wesleyan.edu/cinema/collections/bergman.htm Bergman archive], Wesleyan University</ref>

==Early years: 1915–38==
[[File:Ingrid Bergman at age 14.jpg|thumb|left|Ingrid Bergman at 14]]
Bergman, named after [[Ingrid of Sweden|Princess Ingrid of Sweden]], was born on 29 August 1915 in Stockholm, to a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] father, Justus Bergman, and his [[Germans|German]] wife, Frieda (née Adler) Bergman.<ref name=Chandler>{{cite book|author=Chandler, Charlotte|title=Ingrid: Ingrid Bergman, A Personal Biography|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2007|location=New York|isbn=0-7432-9421-1|pages=19, 21, 294}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=uZuwAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=%22Born+in+Kiel,+Germany+on+September+12,+1884%22|title=Ingrid Bergman and her American Relatives|isbn=9780761861515|author1=Ziolkowska-Boehm|first1=Aleksandra|date=2013-08-28}}</ref> When she was two years of age, her mother died. Her father, who was an artist and photographer, died when she was 13. In the years before he died, he wanted her to become an opera star, and had her take voice lessons for three years. But she always "knew from the beginning that she wanted to be an actress," sometimes wearing her mother's clothes and staging plays in her father's empty studio. Her father documented all her birthdays with a borrowed camera.<ref name=LifeMag/>
[[File:Bergman first role.jpg|thumb|Her first film, ''Munkbrogreven'' (1934) at age 19.]]
After his death, she was sent to live with an aunt, who died of heart disease only six months later. She then moved in with her Aunt Hulda and Uncle Otto, who had five children. Another aunt she visited, Elsa Adler, first told Ingrid, when she was 11, that her mother may have "some Jewish blood," and that her father was aware of that fact long before they married. But her aunt also cautioned her about telling others about her possible ancestry as "there might be some difficult times coming."<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|294}}

At 17, in 1932, Bergman was allowed only one chance to become an actress by entering an acting competition with the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] in Stockholm.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|30–31}} Bergman recalls her feelings during that competition: {{quote|As I walked off the stage, I was in mourning, I was at a funeral. My own. It was the death of my creative self. My heart had truly broken... they didn't think I was even worth listening to, or watching.}}

Her impression was wrong, as she later met one of the judges who described how the others viewed her performance: {{quote|We loved your security and your impertinence. We loved you and told each other that there was no reason to waste time as there were dozens of other entrants still to come. We didn't need to waste any time with you. We knew you were a natural and great. Your future as an actress was settled.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|31–33}}}}

As a result she received a scholarship to the state-sponsored [[Royal Dramatic Theatre School]], where [[Greta Garbo]] had years earlier earned a similar scholarship. After several months she was given a part in a new play, ''Ett Brott'' (''A Crime''), written by Sigfrid Siwertz. Chandler notes that this was "totally against procedure" at the school, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|33}}

During her first summer break, she was also hired by a Swedish film studio, which led to her leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre after just one year, to work in films full-time. Her first film role after leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre was a small part in 1935's ''Munkbrogreven'' (although she had previously been an extra in the 1932 film ''Landskamp''). She went on to act in a dozen films in [[Sweden]], including ''[[En kvinnas ansikte]],'' which was later remade as ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]], and one film in [[Germany]], ''Die vier Gesellen'' (''[[The Four Companions (film)|The Four Companions]]'') (1938).<ref name="imdb"/>

==Hollywood period: 1939–49==
===''Intermezzo: A Love Story'' (1939)===
Bergman's first acting role in the United States came when [[Hollywood]] producer [[David O. Selznick]] brought her to America to star in ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'', an English language remake of her 1936 Swedish film, ''[[Intermezzo (1936 film)|Intermezzo]].'' Unable to speak English and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden. Her husband, Dr. Petter Lindström, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia (born 1938).<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|63}} In ''Intermezzo'', she played the role of a young piano accompanist opposite [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as a famous violin virtuoso. She arrived in [[Los Angeles]] on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence. According to Selznick's son, Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had a few concerns about Ingrid: "She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick." 

Bergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|6}} "He let her have her way," notes a story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]].'' Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and "instructed them to lay off." He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's "synthetic razzle-dazzle."<ref name=LifeMag/> During the following weeks, while ''Intermezzo'' was being filmed, Selznick was also filming ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]].'' In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman:
{{quote|Miss Bergman is the most completely conscientious actress with whom I have ever worked, in that she thinks of absolutely nothing but her work before and during the time she is doing a picture&nbsp;... She practically never leaves the studio, and even suggested that her dressing room be equipped so that she could live here during the picture. She never for a minute suggests quitting at six o'clock or anything of the kind&nbsp;... Because of having four stars acting in ''Gone with the Wind,'' our star dressing-room suites were all occupied and we had to assign her a smaller suite. She went into ecstasies over it and said she had never had such a suite in her life&nbsp;... All of this is completely unaffected and completely unique and I should think would make a grand angle of approach to her publicity&nbsp;... so that her natural sweetness and consideration and conscientiousness become something of a legend&nbsp;... and is completely in keeping with the fresh and pure personality and appearance which caused me to sign her.<ref name=Selznick>Selznick, David O. ''Memo from David O. Selznick," Selected and edited by [[Rudy Behlmer]], Viking Press (1972), in letter dated 22 June 1939</ref>{{rp|135–136}}}}
[[File:Casablanca, Trailer Screenshot.JPG|thumb|With Humphrey Bogart in ''Casablanca'']]
''Intermezzo'' became an enormous success and as a result Bergman became a star. The film's director, [[Gregory Ratoff]], said "She is sensational," as an actress. This was the "sentiment of the entire set," writes ''Life,'' adding that workmen would go out of their way to do things for her, and the cast and crew "admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines."<ref name=LifeMag/> Film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] notes that this would become "the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America" where her lack of makeup contributed to an "air of nobility." According to ''Life,'' the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall (5&nbsp;ft. 9 in.) girl "with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile."<ref name=LifeMag/> Selznick appreciated her uniqueness, and with his wife [[Irene Selznick|Irene]], they remained important friends throughout her career.<ref name=Thomson/>{{rp|76}}

===''Casablanca'' (1942)===
After the onset of World War II, Bergman "felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany" while she was there filming ''Die vier Gesellen'' (The Four Companions). According to one of her biographers, Charlotte Chandler (2007), she had at first considered the [[Nazi]]s only a "temporary aberration, 'too foolish to be taken seriously.' She believed Germany would not start a war." Bergman felt that "The good people there would not permit it."  Chandler adds, "Ingrid felt guilty all the rest of her life because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with the others to witness the atrocities of the Nazi extermination camps."<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|293–295}}

After completing one last film in Sweden and appearing in three moderately successful films (''[[Adam Had Four Sons]]'', ''[[Rage in Heaven]]'' and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', all in 1941) in the United States, Bergman co-starred with [[Humphrey Bogart]] in the 1942 classic film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', which remains her best-known role. In this film, she played the role of Ilsa, the beautiful Norwegian wife of Victor Laszlo, played by [[Paul Henreid]], an "anti-Nazi underground hero" who is in [[Casablanca]], a safe-haven from the Nazis.<ref name=Chandler/> Bergman did not consider ''Casablanca'' to be one of her favorite performances. ''"I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart."''<ref>[http://www.ingridbergman.com The Official Ingrid Bergman Website].</ref> In later years she stated, "I feel about ''Casablanca'' that it has a life of its own. There is something mystical about it. It seems to have filled a need, a need that was there before the film, a need that the film filled."<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|88}}

===''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' (1943)===
After ''Casablanca'', with "Selznick's steady boosting," she played the part of Maria in ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), which was also her first color film. For the role she received her first Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The film was taken from [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s novel of the [[For Whom the Bell Tolls|same title]]. When the book was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]], Hemingway stated that "Miss Bergman, and no one else should play the part." His opinion came from seeing her in her first American role, ''Intermezzo,'' although he hadn't yet met her. A few weeks later, they did meet, and after studying her he said, "You ''are'' Maria!"<ref name=LifeMag>Carlile, Thomas, and Speiser, Jean. ''Life Magazine'', 26 July 1943, pp. 98–104</ref>

===''Gaslight'' (1944)===
[[File:Ingrid Bergman - Gaslight 44.jpg|thumb|Publicity photo for film ''Gaslight'' (1944)]]
The following year, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), a film in which [[George Cukor]] directed her as a "wife driven close to madness" by co-star [[Charles Boyer]]. The film, according to Thomson, "was the peak of her Hollywood glory."<ref name=Thomson/>{{rp|77}} Bergman next played a nun in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945) opposite [[Bing Crosby]], for which she received her third consecutive nomination for Best Actress.

===Hitchcock films===
Bergman starred in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] films ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]'' (1946), and ''[[Under Capricorn]]'' (1949). ''Under Capricorn,'' the only one of the three made in color, was a costume drama which has never received the acclaim that the other films that Bergman made with Hitchcock. Bergman was a student of the acting coach [[Michael Chekhov]] during the 1940s. Coincidentally, it was for his role in ''Spellbound'' that Chekhov received his only Academy Award nomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=5949|title=Michael Chekhov|work=Literary Encyclopedia|publisher=The Literary Dictionary Company Limited|author=Adam J. Ledger|accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref>

===''Joan of Arc'' (1948)===
Bergman received another Best Actress nomination for ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), an independent film based on the Maxwell Anderson play ''[[Joan of Lorraine]]'', produced by [[Walter Wanger]], and initially released through [[RKO]]. Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, which was one of the reasons she had played it on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the scandal of Bergman's affair with [[Italian people|Italian]] film director [[Roberto Rossellini]], which broke while the film was still in theatres. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination. It was subsequently shorn of 45 minutes. It was not until it was restored to full length in 1998 and released in 2004 on [[DVD]] that later audiences could see it as it was intended to be shown.

Between motion pictures, Bergman had appeared in the stage plays ''[[Liliom]]'', ''[[Anna Christie]]'', and ''Joan of Lorraine''. During a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the promotion of ''Joan of Lorraine'', she protested against [[racial segregatio]]n after seeing it first hand at the theater she was acting in. This led to a lot of publicity and some hate mail. Bergman went to [[Alaska]] during World War II to entertain [[US Army]] troops. Soon after the war ended, she also went to [[Europe]] for the same purpose, where she was able to see the devastation caused by the war. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Personal life==
In 1937, at the age of 21, Bergman married dentist Petter Aron Lindström (later to become a neurosurgeon), and they had a daughter, [[Pia Lindström|Friedel Pia Lindström]] (born 20 September 1938). After returning to the [[United States]] in 1940, she acted on Broadway before continuing to do films in Hollywood. The following year, her husband arrived from Sweden with daughter Pia. Lindström stayed in [[Rochester, New York]], where he studied medicine and surgery at the [[University of Rochester]]. Bergman would travel to [[New York]] and stay at their small rented stucco house between films, her visits lasting from a few days to four months.

According to an article in ''Life Magazine'', the "doctor regards himself as the undisputed head of the family, an idea that Ingrid accepts cheerfully." He insisted she draw the line between her film and personal life, as he has a "professional dislike for being associated with the tinseled glamor of Hollywood." Lindström later moved to [[San Francisco]], California, where he completed his internship at a private hospital, and they continued to spend time together when she could travel between filming.<ref name=LifeMag/>

Bergman returned to Europe after the scandalous publicity surrounding her affair with Italian director [[Roberto Rossellini]] during the filming of ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'' in 1950. In the same month the film was released, she gave birth to a boy, Robertino Rossellini (born 2 February 1950). A week after her son was born, she divorced Lindström and married Rossellini in Mexico. On 18 June 1952 she gave birth to the twin daughters Isotta Ingrid Rossellini and [[Isabella Rossellini]]. In 1957 she divorced Rossellini. The next year she married Lars Schmidt, a theatrical entrepreneur from a wealthy Swedish shipping family. That marriage lasted nearly two decades, until 1975 when they divorced. {{cn|date=March 2015}}

During her marriage with Lindstrom, Bergman had a brief affair with ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' costar [[Gregory Peck]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Haney|first=Lynn|title=''Gregory Peck: A Charmed Life''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGqLGiJl69oC&pg=PT31&dq=ingrid+bergman+gregory+peck&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WTdKVbScFMG1sQTFq4DABg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=ingrid%20bergman%20gregory%20peck&f=false|year=2009|isbn=9780786737819|publisher=De Capo Press}}</ref> Unlike the affair with Rossellini, that with Peck was kept private until he confessed it to Brad Darrach of ''[[People (American magazine)|People]]'' in an interview five years after Bergman's death. Peck said, “All I can say is that I had a real love for her (Bergman), and I think that’s where I ought to stop…. I was young. She was young. We were involved for weeks in close and intense work.”<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=NJId3XPaeR0C&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=ingrid+bergman+gregory+peck+affair#v=onepage&q=ingrid%20bergman%20gregory%20peck%20affair&f=false|title=Gregory Peck: A Biography|isbn=9780684852904|author1=Fishgall|first1=Gary|year=2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cRWgEXLEzFQC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=gregory+peck+ingrid+bergman+affair#v=onepage&q=gregory%20peck%20ingrid%20bergman%20affair&f=false|title=Ingrid Bergman: The Life, Career and Public Image|isbn=9780786472260|author1=Smit|first1=David|year=2012}}</ref>

==Italian period with Rossellini: 1949–57==
[[File:Ingrid Bergman - 1954.JPG|thumb|In ''Fear'' (1954)]]
Bergman strongly admired two films by Italian [[Film director|director]] [[Roberto Rossellini]] that she had seen in the United States. In 1949, Bergman wrote to Rossellini, expressing this admiration and suggesting that she make a film with him. This led to her being cast in his film ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]]'' (1950). During production, Bergman fell in love with Rossellini, and they began an affair. Bergman became pregnant with their son, Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe ("Robin") Rossellini (born 2 February 1950).<ref name=Bondanella>Bondanella, Peter E. ''The Films of Robert Rossellini", Cambridge University Press (1993)</ref>{{rp|18}}

This affair caused a huge scandal in the United States, where it led to Bergman being denounced on the floor of the [[United States Senate]]. [[Ed Sullivan]] chose not to have her on his show, despite a poll indicating that the public wanted her to appear.<ref name=Sullivan>{{cite episode|title=Steve Allen|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/allen_steve.html|series=The Mike Wallace Interview|network=ABC|city=New York City|airdate=7 July 1957|transcripturl=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/allen_steve_t.html}}</ref> However, [[Steve Allen]], whose show was equally popular, did have her on, later explaining "the danger of trying to judge artistic activity through the prism of one's personal life."<ref name=Sullivan/> Spoto notes that Bergman had, by virtue of her roles and screen persona, placed herself "above all that". She had played a nun in ''[[The Bells of St. Mary's]]'' (1945) and a virgin saint in ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948). Bergman later said, "People saw me in ''Joan of Arc'' and declared me a saint. I'm not. I'm just a woman, another human being."<ref name=Spoto/>{{rp|300}}

As a result of the scandal, Bergman returned to Italy, leaving her husband and daughter (Pia). She went through a publicized divorce and custody battle for their daughter. Bergman and Rossellini were married on 24 May 1950. In addition to Renato, they had twin daughters (born 18 June 1952): [[Isabella Rossellini]], who became an actress and model, and Isotta Ingrid Rossellini, who became a professor of [[Italian literature]]. {{cn|date=March 2015}}

===''Stromboli'' and "neorealism"===
[[File:Bergman with Rossellini.jpg|thumb|With husband [[Roberto Rossellini]] in 1951]]
Rossellini completed five films starring Bergman between 1949 and 1955: ''[[Stromboli (film)|Stromboli]],'' ''[[Europa '51]],'' ''[[Viaggio in Italia]],'' ''[[Giovanna d'Arco al rogo]],'' and [[Fear (1954 film)|''La Paura'' (''Fear'')]].

Rossellini directed her in a brief segment of his 1953 documentary film, ''Siamo donne'' (We, the Women), which was devoted to film actresses.<ref name=Bondanella/>{{rp|18}} His biographer Peter Bondanella notes that problems with communication during their marriage may have inspired his films' central themes of "solitude, grace and spirituality in a world without moral values."<ref name=Bondanella/>{{rp|19}}

[[File:Bergman stromboli mpazdziora.JPG|thumb|left|Memorial plaque on the house in [[Stromboli]] where Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini lived during filming of "Stromboli" in 1949]]
Rossellini's use of a Hollywood star in his typically "neorealist" films, in which he normally used non-professional actors, did provoke some negative reactions in certain circles. In Bergman's first film with Rossellini, her character was "defying audience expectations" in that the director preferred to work without a script, forcing Bergman to act "inspired by reality while she worked, a style which Bondanella calls 'a new cinema of psychological introspection'".<ref name=Bondanella/>{{rp|98}} Bergman was aware of Rossellini's directing style before filming, as the director had earlier written to her explaining that he worked from "a few basic ideas, developing them little by little" as a film progressed.<ref name=Bondanella/>{{rp|19}}

After separating from Rossellini, Bergman starred in [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[Elena and Her Men]]'' (''Elena et les Hommes,'' 1956), a romantic comedy in which she played a [[Poland|Polish]] princess caught up in political intrigue. Although the film wasn't a success, it has since come to be regarded as one of her best performances.

===''Anastasia'' (1956)===
[[File:Ingrid Bergman - Mel Ferrer - 1957.jpg|thumb|with [[Mel Ferrer]] in ''[[Elena and Her Men]]'' (1957)]]
With her starring role in 1956's ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'', Bergman made a triumphant return to the American screen and won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for a second time. The award was accepted for her by her friend [[Cary Grant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/1957|title=1957 Academy Awards|work=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=23 October 2006}}</ref>

Bergman made her first post-scandal public appearance in Hollywood in the 1958 Academy Awards, when she was the presenter of the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theoscarsite.com/1958.htm|title=All the Oscars: 1958|work=OscarSite.com – A celebration of all things Oscar|author=Gary Moody|accessdate=10 December 2006}}</ref> She was given a standing ovation, after being introduced by [[Cary Grant]] and walking out onto the stage to present the award. She continued to alternate between performances in American and European films for the rest of her career and also made occasional appearances in television dramas such as a 1959 production of ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' for the ''[[Startime (TV series)|Ford Startime]]'' TV series—for which she won the [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress.

During this time, she performed in several stage plays. She married producer Lars Schmidt, a fellow Swede, on 21 December 1958. This marriage ended in divorce in 1975. Schmidt died on 18 October 2009. After a long hiatus, Bergman made the film ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'' in 1969, with [[Walter Matthau]] and [[Goldie Hawn]].

In 1972, [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Charles H. Percy]] entered an apology into the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' for the attack made on Bergman 22 years earlier by [[Edwin C. Johnson]].

Bergman was the President of the Jury at the 1973 [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/perso/index.php?langue=6002&personne=4296444|title=Ingrid Bergman profile|work=[[Cannes Film Festival]]|accessdate=23 October 2006}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===''Murder on the Orient Express'' (1974)===
Bergman became one of the few actresses ever to receive three Oscars when she won her third (and first in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]) for her performance in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974). Director [[Sidney Lumet]] offered Bergman the important part of Princess Dragomiroff, with which he felt she could win an Oscar. She insisted on playing the much smaller role of Greta Ohlsson, the old Swedish missionary. Lumet discussed Bergman's role:

:"She had chosen a very small part, and I couldn't persuade her to change her mind. She was sweetly stubborn. But stubborn she was... Since her part was so small, I decided to film her one big scene, where she talks for almost five minutes, straight, all in one long take. A lot of actresses would have hesitated over that. She loved the idea and made the most of it. She ran the gamut of emotions. I've never seen anything like it."<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|246–247}}

[[File:Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann in Autumn Sonata.jpg|thumb|left|<center>With [[Liv Ullmann]] in ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'' (1978)</center>]]
Bergman could speak Swedish (her native language), German (her second language, learned from her German mother and in school), English (learned when brought over to the United States), Italian (learned while living in Italy)<ref name="Leamer">{{cite book|title=As Time Goes By: The Life of Ingrid Bergman|author=Leamer, Laurence|publisher=[[Harper & Row]]|year=1986|isbn=0-06-015485-3}}</ref> and French (her third language, learned in school). She acted in each of these languages at various times. Fellow actor [[John Gielgud]], who had acted with her in ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' and who had directed her in the play ''[[The Constant Wife]]'', playfully commented: "She speaks five languages and can't act in any of them."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Aug-26-Mon-2002/news/19489130.html|title=The Punch Line|publisher=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=26 August 2002|accessdate=22 October 2006}}</ref>

Although known chiefly as a film star, Bergman strongly admired the great English stage actors and their craft. She had the opportunity to appear in London's [[West End theatre|West End]], working with such stage stars as [[Michael Redgrave]] in ''A Month in the Country'' (1965), Sir John Gielgud in ''The Constant Wife'' (1973) and [[Wendy Hiller]] in ''Waters of the Moon'' (1977–78). {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===''Autumn Sonata'' (1978)===
[[File:Bergman-as-Golda.jpg|thumb|<center>In ''A Woman Called Golda''</center>]]
In 1978, Bergman played in [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'' (''Höstsonaten'') for which she received her 7th Academy Award nomination. This was her final performance on the big screen. In the film, Bergman plays a celebrity pianist who travels to [[Norway]] to visit her neglected daughter, played by [[Liv Ullmann]]. The film was shot in Norway.

In 1979, Bergman hosted the AFI's Life Achievement Award Ceremony for [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0268597|title=The American Film Institute Salute to Alfred Hitchcock|work=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=23 October 2006}}
</ref>

===''A Woman Called Golda'' (1982) – her final role===
In 1982 she was offered the starring role in a television mini-series, ''[[A Woman Called Golda]]'', about the late [[Israel]]i [[prime minister]] [[Golda Meir]]. It was to be her final acting role and she was honored posthumously with a second [[Emmy Award]] for Best Actress.  Her daughter, Isabella, described Ingrid's surprise at being offered the part and the producer trying to explain to her, "People believe you and trust you, and this is what I want, because Golda Meir had the trust of the people." Isabella adds, "Now ''that'' was interesting to Mother." She was also persuaded that Golda was a "grand-scale person," one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was. Chandler notes that the role "also had a special significance for her, as during World War II, Ingrid felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany."<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|293}}

According to Chandler, "Ingrid's rapidly deteriorating health was a more serious problem. Insurance for Ingrid was impossible. Not only did she have cancer, but it was spreading, and if anyone had known how bad it was, no one would have gone on with the project." After viewing the series on TV, Isabella commented,

{{quote|She never showed herself like that in life. In life, Mum showed courage. She was always a little vulnerable, courageous, but vulnerable. Mother had a sort of presence, like Golda, I was surprised to see it&nbsp;... When I saw her performance, I saw a mother that I'd never seen before—this woman with balls.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|290}}}}
Bergman was frequently ill during the filming although she rarely complained or showed it. Four months after the filming was completed, she died. After her death her daughter Pia accepted her Emmy.<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|296}}

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Norra, Ingrid.JPG|thumb|left|Ingrid Bergman's grave at [[Norra Begravningsplatsen]]]]
Bergman died in 1982 on her 67th birthday in London, of [[breast cancer]]. Her body was cremated at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London, and her ashes taken to Sweden. Most of them were scattered in the sea around the islet of Dannholmen off the fishing village of [[Fjällbacka]] in [[Bohuslän]], on the west coast of [[Sweden]], where she spent most of the summers from 1958 until her death in 1982. The rest were placed next to her parents' ashes in [[Norra Begravningsplatsen]] (Northern Cemetery), [[Stockholm]], Sweden.

According to biographer [[Donald Spoto]], she was "arguably the most international star in the history of entertainment." Acting in five languages, she was seen on stage, screen and television, and won three Academy Awards plus many others.<ref name=Spoto>Spoto, Donald. ''Notorious: The Life of Ingrid Bergman'', HarperCollins (1997), Intro.</ref>  After her American film debut in the 1939 film ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo: A Love Story]]'', co-starring [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], Hollywood saw her as a unique actress who was completely natural in style and without need of makeup. Film critic [[James Agee]] wrote that she "not only bears a startling resemblance to an imaginable human being; she really knows how to act, in a blend of poetic grace with quiet realism."<ref name=James/>

According to film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], she "always strove to be a 'true' woman", and many filmgoers identified with her:

{{quote|There was a time in the early and mid-1940s when Bergman commanded a kind of love in America that has been hardly ever matched. In turn, it was the strength of that affection that animated the "scandal" when she behaved like an impetuous and ambitious actress instead of a saint.<ref name=Thomson>Thomson, David. ''The New Biographical Dictionary of Film,'' Alfred A. Knopf, N.Y. (2002)</ref>{{rp|76}}}}

Writing about her first years in Hollywood, ''[[Life Magazine|Life]]'' magazine stated that "All Bergman vehicles are blessed," and "they all go speedily and happily, with no temperament from the leading lady."<ref name=LifeMag/> She was "completely pleased" with her early career's management by [[David O. Selznick]], who always found excellent dramatic roles for her to play, and equally satisfied with her salary, once saying, "I am an actress and I am interested in acting, not in making money." ''Life'' adds that "she has greater versatility than any actress on the American screen&nbsp;... her roles have demanded an adaptability and sensitiveness of characterization to which few actresses could rise."<ref name=LifeMag/>

She continued her acting career while suffering from cancer for eight years, and won international honors for her final roles. "Her spirit triumphed with remarkable grace and courage," adds Spoto.<ref name=Spoto/> Director [[George Cukor]] once summed up her contributions to the film media when he said to her, "Do you know what I especially love about you, Ingrid, my dear? I can sum it up as your naturalness. The camera loves your beauty, your acting, and your individuality. A star must have individuality. It makes you a great star. A great star."<ref name=Chandler/>{{rp|11}}

For her contributions to the motion picture industry, Bergman has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6759 Hollywood Blvd.

[[Woody Guthrie]] wrote the erotic song "Ingrid Bergman", which references Bergman's relationship with [[Roberto Rosselini]] on the film ''[[Stromboli]]''. It was never recorded by Guthrie but, when later found in the Woody Guthrie archives, it was set to music, and recorded, by [[Billy Bragg]] on the album ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anna|first=Canoni|title=Woody Guthrie's daughter|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/anna_canoni_about_woody_guthrie/|work=Interview}}</ref>

In March 2015, a picture of Bergman photographed by [[David Seymour (photographer)|David Seymour]] was chosen for the main poster for the [[2015 Cannes Film Festival]]. A documentary titled ''[[Ingrid Bergman: In Her Own Words]]'' was also screened at the festival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/61281.html |title=It's poster time at the Festival de Cannes! |accessdate=24 March 2015|work=Cannes}}</ref>

===Autobiography===
[[File:Ingridbergman casa.jpg|thumb|200px|Scene from ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]],'' with co-star [[Humphrey Bogart]]]]
In 1980, Bergman's autobiography was published under the title ''Ingrid Bergman: My Story.'' It was written with the help of [[Alan Burgess]], and in it she discusses her childhood, her early career, her life during her time in Hollywood, the Rossellini scandal, and subsequent events. The book was written after her children warned her that she would only be known through rumors and interviews if she did not tell her own story. It was through this autobiography that her affair with [[Robert Capa]] became known.

==Awards==
Bergman won three [[Academy Awards]] for acting, two for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and one for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]. She ranks in equal second place in terms of Oscars won, with [[Walter Brennan]] (all three for Best Supporting Actor), [[Jack Nicholson]] (two for Best Actor and one for Best Supporting Actor), [[Meryl Streep]] (two for Best Actress and one for Best Supporting Actress), and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] (all three for Best Actor). [[Katharine Hepburn]] still leads the record with four (all four for Best Actress).
