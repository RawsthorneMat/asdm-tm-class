'''Rhea Mitchell''' (December 10, 1890 &ndash; September 16, 1957) was an American film [[actress]] who began her career during the [[silent film]] era. She earned the name of "the little stunt girl" because of her willingness to attempt thrilling scenes in motion pictures.<ref>Daisy Dean  "News Notes From Movieland",  ''Janesville Daily Gazette'' (Wednesday, October 4, 1916) p 6, Janesville, Wisconsin</ref>

==Career==
Mitchell began her career in 1909 playing in the [[Summer stock theatre|Baker Theater Stock Company]] in her hometown of [[Portland, Oregon]]. She followed with a season in the [[Orpheum Circuit]] and a run at the Alcazar Theater in [[San Francisco]].<ref name=moving>''The Moving Picture World'', Vol. 29 (1916) Chalmers Publishing Company, New York</ref> Mitchell made her film debut in 1912 with the New York Motion Picture Corporation <ref name=moving/> and would eventually appear in over 100 films during her career. She appeared a number of times with [[Western (genre)|Western]] star [[William S. Hart]] playing a leading role in those films. In 1916 she played in ''The Brink'' with Forrest Winant and Arthur Maude.<ref>"Unique Theater", ''Marshfield Times''  (April 26, 1916) p4, Marshfield, Wisconsin</ref>
  
After 1917, her roles became smaller and she appeared in a handful of films through the mid-30s and in several bit parts during the early 1950s which often went uncredited.

==Later years and death==
After her retirement from films, Mitchell managed a large apartment house in [[Los Angeles]].  While managing a second apartment in 1957, the La Brea District Apartments, a disgruntled houseboy named Sonnie Hartford, Jr., strangled her with the cord of her blue silk dressing gown.<ref name=telegram>"Ex-Star Slain, Jail Houseboy" (September 17, 1957) ''Long Beach, California Press-Telegram'' p 1.</ref><ref>''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "Ex-Actress Strangled", September 17, 1957, Page 38.</ref> An article in the ''Press-Telegram'' read in part, <blockquote>"A search still was being made by police for a 'baldish, middleaged man' who reportedly kept company recently with the never-married Miss Mitchell. Seattle police were asked to question Miss Mitchell's only known relative, an aunt, Mrs. John Benson. Police said there was no sign of a struggle or criminal attack. Her body was discovered by the houseboy. The actress, known as Ginger to her friends, had played opposite such silent film stars as William S. Hart, [[Tom Mix]], [[King Baggot]] and [[Bert Lytell]].... She had appeared in film bit roles as recently as 1951."<ref name=telegram/></blockquote>

Mitchell is buried at [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.
