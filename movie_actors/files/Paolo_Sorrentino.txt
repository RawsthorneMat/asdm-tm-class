'''Paolo Sorrentino''' ({{IPA-it|ˈpaolo sorrenˈtino|lang}}; born 31 May 1970) is an [[Italy|Italian]] film director and screenwriter.

==Life and career==
Sorrentino was born in [[Naples]]. His first film as screenwriter, ''[[The Dust of Naples]]'', was released in 1998. He also began directing short movies, including ''L'amore non ha confini'' in 1998 and ''La notte lunga'' in 2001. His feature-length debut was ''[[One Man Up]]'' (''L'uomo in più''), for which he was awarded the [[Nastro d'Argento for Best New Director|Nastro D'Argento]] prize.

He achieved international recognition in 2004 for his thriller, ''[[The Consequences of Love]]'' (''Le conseguenze dell'amore''). The film, which explores the mindset of a lonely businessman being used as a pawn by the [[Mafia]], won many awards and was nominated for the [[Palme D'Or]] at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4200633/year/2004.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Consequences of Love |accessdate=2009-11-30|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>
