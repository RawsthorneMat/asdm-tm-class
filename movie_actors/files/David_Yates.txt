==Career==

===Television and film career (1988–2005)===
[[File:BeaconsfieldFilmStudios.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The [[National Film and Television School]], where Yates trained as a director and from whom he received the Honorary Fellowship for Outstanding Contribution to the British Film and Television Industry in 2010, joining the likes of [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Alan Parker]], [[Nick Park]] and [[David Lean]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nftsfilm-tv.ac.uk/who-we-are/honorary-fellows |title=Honorary Fellows |work=NFTS |accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>]]

In 1988, Yates made his first serious film ''When I Was a Girl'' with the assistance of Cre8 Studios in [[Swindon]]. The short film, which was shot in Swindon town under a grant from Southern Arts, entered the festival circuit where it was named [[San Francisco International Film Festival#Golden Gate Awards|Best Short Film]] at the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], in addition to obtaining other awards. It contributed to Yates' acceptance into the [[National Film and Television School]] in 1989 and led to the [[BBC]] hiring him to direct ''Oranges and Lemons'', a short drama film in 1991. Before completing film school, he began to direct, produce and write the screenplay to the dramatic short ''The Weaver's Wife''. He also made his fourth short film ''Good Looks'', which was presented at the [[Chicago International Film Festival]]. After graduating in 1992, Yates directed an episode of the film studies programme ''[[Moving Pictures (TV series)|Moving Pictures]]'', which was a survey of low-budget filmmaking in Britain.<ref name="FilmLondon-DavidYates"/><ref name="Yahoo!Movies-DavidYatesBio"/><ref name="NFTS-DavidYatesCourses">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nftsfilm-tv.ac.uk/index.php?module=People&type=Alumni&people_id=310&back=course&course_id=149 |title=Courses ...

From 1994 to 1995, Yates directed several episodes of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] police procedural ''[[The Bill]]'' (''Full Contact'', ''Death and Taxes'', ''Other Voices'', ''Feeling Guilty'' and ''Life's a Bitch''), before directing and producing three episodes of the television documentary ''Tale of Three Seaside Towns'' alongside producer Alistair Clarke. The programme followed media personalities [[Russell Grant]], [[Honor Blackman]] and [[Pam Ayres]] visiting and exploring the [[Southern England|South Coast]] towns of [[Brighton]], [[Eastbourne]] and [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/282 |title=The Tichborne Claimant  |publisher=Philip Kemp, Sight and Sound |date=December 1999 |accessdate=14 March 2011|quote=Yates, making his feature-film debut after directing television documentaries about British seaside towns...}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.myfairladythemusical.com/uk_cast_Blackman.htm|title=Cast & Creative ...

Yates returned to television in 2000 to direct the episodes of ''Greed'', ''Envy'' and ''Lust'' for the BBC miniseries ''[[The Sins]]'', starring [[Pete Postlethwaite]], as well as ''[[The Way We Live Now (2001 TV serial)|The Way We Live Now]]'', the acclaimed four-part television adaptation of the [[The Way We Live Now|novel of the same name]] by [[Anthony Trollope]]. Among the actors which Yates directed were [[David Suchet]], [[Cillian Murphy]] and [[Miranda Otto]] in their roles as Augustus Melmotte, Paul Montague and Mrs. Hurtle respectively. Yates shared the [[British Academy Television Awards#Categories|British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Serial]] with screenwriter [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] and producer [[Nigel Stafford-Clark]] at the [[British Academy Television Awards 2002|2002 BAFTA Awards]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=2002 |title=Past Winners and Nominees – Film – Awards – the BAFTA site, Film Nominations 2002 |publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts|accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref> The serial became available to buy worldwide on [[VHS]] on 22 April 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2002/04_april/the_way_we_live.shtml |title=The Way We Live Now – on VHS |work=[[BBC]]|date=2 April 2002|accessdate=2 August 2011}}</ref>

One year later, Yates attended the [[56th British Academy Film Awards|56th BAFTA Awards]] with a [[BAFTA Award for Best Short Film|British Academy Film Award nomination for Best Short Film]] for the fourteen-minute production, ''[[Rank (film)|Rank]]'', which expressed the social elements of racism, friendship and adolescence through the story of a street gang that cross [[Glasgow]] to witness the arrival of a group of Somali refugees.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.britfilms.com/britishfilms/catalogue/browse/?id=D9CC70591925b1964DGtH218B43F |title=The British Films Catalogue, Rank|publisher=Brit Films |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.film4.com/features/article/funding-your-short-film |title=Funding Your Short Film |publisher=Film4|accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> Yates said that even though ''The Way We Live Now'' was "a very big production" and "enormous fun to do", ''Rank'' was an opportunity to "shake all that off" and "get back to [his] roots." Of the casting, Yates said that he "wanted to use non-actors to tell the story, to create a reality ... the kids we cast in Glasgow had never done a film before."<ref name="FilmLondon-DavidYates"/> The film was noted for its gritty style and cinematography, with a review from ''Eye For Film'' stating that "such intelligent use of camera and cast lifts Yates out of the pool of promising young directors into the front line of genuine hopefuls.

The 2003 six-part thriller ''[[State of Play (TV serial)|State of Play]]'' was Yates' next achievement.<ref name="DavidYatesDoesItAll">{{Cite news|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/david_yates_harry_potter_and_the_half_blood_prince_20090708/ |title=David Yates Does It All |publisher=MovieMaker |date= 9 July 2009 |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref> He directed a mix of acclaimed actors such as [[David Morrissey]], [[John Simm]] and [[James McAvoy]] in the main roles of the BBC serial, created by [[Paul Abbott]].

Yates then moved on to helm more high-profile projects such as the television adaptation of nine-year-old [[Daisy Ashford]]'s novel ''[[The Young Visiters#Adaptations|The Young Visiters]]'', starring [[Jim Broadbent]] alongside [[Hugh Laurie]]. Broadbent gained an acting nomination at the BAFTA Awards under Yates' direction, which was a different approach in comparison to his immediate previous work. According to a review by [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] magazine for [[BBC America]], Yates and his team yielded "a warm and surprisingly unsentimental production that has 'evergreen' written all over it". ''The Young Visiters'' tells the story of a bumbling man (Broadbent) seeking help from an aristocrat (Laurie), who attempts to improve his social graces for him to be accepted by a high society woman.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117925407?refCatId=32  |title=The Young Visiters (Movie – BBC America; Wednesday, Nov.&nbsp;3, 8 p.m.) |work=Variety   |date= 31 October 2004 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |first=Brian |last=Lowry}}</ref>

In 2004, Yates' two-part drama ''[[Sex Traffic]]'' was broadcast on [[Channel 4]]. It won eight BAFTA Awards including [[BAFTA Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]] for [[Mark Day (editor)|Mark Day]], who regularly worked with Yates on many of his television projects and short films.

Also in 2004, Yates was involved in plans for a film adaptation of [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s novel ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' for [[Warner Independent Pictures]]. He was set to work with [[Paul Bettany]], [[Jude Law]] and [[Jennifer Connelly]] on the project, but pulled out in the later stages due to constant budget issues affecting the film's production.<ref name="DarkHorizons-DavidYatesBridesheadRevisited&HBP">{{Cite news|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/features/1448/david-yates-for-harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince  |title=Exclusive Interview: David Yates for "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" |publisher=Paul Fischer, Dark Horizons |date= 13 July 2009 |accessdate=4 March 2011| quote=He had been developing a version of Evelyn Waugh's novel, Brideshead Revisited in 2004 for the studio's art house division, Warner Independent Pictures, with husband-and-wife actors Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connolly negotiating to play the leads, but after finally landing the highly coveted "Potter" job and with budget issues stalling "Brideshead," Yates transitioned into his new assignment.}}</ref><ref name="VarietyReviewsBrideshead">{{Cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117937762?refcatid=31  |title=Variety Reviews: Brideshead Revisited |work=Variety   |date=18 July 2008 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |quote=Reportedly, Paul Bettany, Jude Law and Jennifer Connelly were attached until helmer David Yates was poached for last year's "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."

Yates then directed [[Richard Curtis]]' script to ''[[The Girl in the Café]]'', a television film starring [[Bill Nighy]] and [[Kelly Macdonald]]. In June 2005, the film was aired on the BBC in Britain and was also broadcast in the United States on the premium cable television network [[HBO|Home Box Office]]. ''The Girl in the Café'' achieved three wins at the [[Emmy Award]]s, most notably the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Made for Television Movie]], and gained a total of four nominations including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special|Outstanding Directing]] for Yates and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Casting for a Miniseries, Movie, or a Special|Outstanding Casting]] for [[Fiona Weir]]. The film became known for being conceived to coincide both with the BBC's ''Africa Lives'' season of programming and with the global [[Make Poverty History]] campaign. The message of the film is conveyed through the character-driven story of Lawrence (Nighy) and Gina (Macdonald) dealing with their feelings for one another while challenging political concerns at the G8 Summit in [[Reykjavík]].<ref name="Yahoo!Movies-DavidYatesBio"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity-awards-and-nominations/david-yates.1/  |title=David Yates – Awards & Nominations (Emmy Award) |publisher=MSN Movies |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000223/2006  |title=Emmy Awards for 2006 |publisher=IMDb  |date= 19 August 2006 |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref>

In 2007, ''Order of the Phoenix'' opened to positive reviews and achieved commercial success.

During production on ''Half-Blood Prince'', [[Alan F.

{{cquote2|People who work in television often don’t think they can trust filmmakers because they are supposed to be a bit more arty and self indulgent, and people in film might think anyone who works in television is a hack. The fact is that we don’t need this divide, it does our collective industry no favours whatsoever, and if we had more filmmakers working in television, and more television writers and directors working in film, we’d have a much healthier and more vital industry. At the end of the day, whatever medium you work in, it is about storytelling and holding your audience. There are big differences of course, between film and television. In my television work I’ve had to move a lot faster than in the film work I’ve done, which is no bad thing.
