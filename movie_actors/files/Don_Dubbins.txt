'''Don Dubbins''', originally '''Donald George Dubbins''' (June 28, 1928 - August 17, 1991), was an American actor of film and television who in his early career usually played younger military roles, particularly in such classic pictures as ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953) and ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'' (1954). 

Screen giant [[James Cagney]] took a liking to Dubbins and procured roles for him in two 1956 films, ''[[These Wilder Years]]'' and ''[[Tribute to a Bad Man]]''. In the former, Dubbins played Cagney's long-lost biological son; in the latter, he was in a romantic triangle with cattle boss Cagney for the affections of a [[senorita]]. In 1957, Dubbins played a callow young [[United States Marines]] [[private (rank)|private]] in [[Jack Webb]]'s ''[[The D.I.

As Dubbins' career progressed, he appeared in such films as ''[[The Prize (1963 film)|The Prize]]'' (1963), ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'' (based on a [[Ray Bradbury]] novel) (1969), and ''[[Death Wish II]]'' (1982). 

Dubbins appeared in many television series, including seven episodes of [[CBS]]'s ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' in many typecasts, from a scheming nephew and murder victim in "The Case of the Counterfeit Crank," to Bill Vincent, one of Hamilton Burger's deputy district attorneys.  He appeared in four episodes each of CBS's ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', in the latter in the first-season episode "Incident of the Dog Days". 

In the spring of 1959, Dubbins was cast in different roles in two consecutive episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] western series, ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' with [[Will Hutchins]] in the title role. In "The Mountain" (March 31, 1959), he played "good guy" Vic Bradley, an escaped convicted murderer for whom Sugarfoot brings news of a new trial based on additional evidence uncovered in the case. Miranda Jones plays Bradley's Indian wife, Jean. The couple is hidden away in a mine shaft in a mountain, and much of the episode deals with Sugarfoot and Jean seemingly lost in a cave-in. Bradley's brother-in-law, Dixon White Eagle ([[Don Devlin]]), on his deathbed from a snake bite, confesses to the crime for which Bradley had been convicted, the killing of an old miner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0712918/?ref_=tt_ep_nx|title="The Mountain", March 31, 1959|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref>
