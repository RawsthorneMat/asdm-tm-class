'''Alfred "Fred" Zinnemann''' (April 29, 1907{{spaced ndash}}March 14, 1997) was an [[Austrian-American|Austro-American]] film director. He won Academy Awards for directing films in many genres, including [[thriller film|thrillers]], [[western (genre)|westerns]], ''[[film noir]]'', and [[drama|play]] adaptations. Nineteen actors appearing in Zinnemann's films received [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for their performances: among that number are [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Glynis Johns]], [[Paul Scofield]], [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]], [[Wendy Hiller]], [[Jason Robards]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Maximilian Schell]].

==Early life==
Zinnemann was born in [[Rzeszów]], [[Austria-Hungary]], <!-- NOT Vienna, which he self propagated long years! see german wiki for the discussion --> the son of Anna (Feiwel) and Oskar Zinnemann, a doctor.<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=gvFkAAAAMAAJ&q=Dr.+Oskar+Anna+Zinnemann&dq=Dr.+Oskar+Anna+Zinnemann&source=bl&ots=Kv8iEr7nM3&sig=SuV4kVKo0tCHjGDbDANPWK_hu1w&hl=en&redir_esc=y Google Books]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=SiK_3d6a7DQC&pg=PR17&dq=Anna+Oskar+Zinnemann&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XabxVOmECpDlsASMlIGABg&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA]</ref> His family was [[Jew]]ish. While growing up in Austria, he wanted to become a musician, but went on to graduate with a law degree from the [[University of Vienna]] in 1927.<ref name=Hillstrom/>  While studying law, he became drawn to films and eventually moved to Paris where he became a [[cinematographer|cameraman]] after studying for a year at the Ecole Technique de Photographie et Cinématographie.<ref name=Hillstrom/>

==Career as director==

===Early career===
Zinnemann worked in Germany with several other beginners ([[Billy Wilder]] and [[Robert Siodmak]] also worked with him on the 1929 feature ''[[People on Sunday]]'') before going to France to study film. His penchant for realism and authenticity is evident in his first feature ''[[Redes (film)|The Wave]]'' (1935), shot on location in Mexico with mostly non-professional actors recruited among the locals, which is one of the earliest examples of [[social realism]] in narrative film. Earlier in the decade, in fact, Zinnemann had worked with documentarian [[Robert Flaherty]], "probably the greatest single influence on my work as a filmmaker", he said.<ref name=Hillstrom/>

===1940s===
Zinnemann moved to Hollywood in December 1934 following the completion of his first directorial effort for the Mexican cultural protest film, ''The Wave'', in Alvarado, Mexico.   He established residence in a studio apartment complex at 7900 Honey Drive in North Hollywood with [[Henwar Rodakiewicz]], [[Gunther von Fritsch]] and [[Ned Scott]], all fellow contributors to the Mexican project.<ref>[http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/ned-scott-biography.html Ned Scott Biography]</ref> One of Zinnemann's first assignments in Hollywood was when he found work as an [[extra (actor)|extra]] in ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1930), although he was later discharged from the production. After some success with short films, he graduated to features in 1942, turning out two crisp B mysteries, ''[[Eyes in the Night]]'' and ''[[Kid Glove Killer]]'' before getting his big break with ''[[The Seventh Cross (film)|The Seventh Cross]]'' (1944), starring [[Spencer Tracy]], which was his first hit. The film was based on [[Anna Seghers]]' novel and, while filmed entirely on the [[MGM]] [[backlot]], made realistic use of refugee German actors in even the smallest roles. The central character—an escaped prisoner played by Tracy—is seen as comparatively passive and fatalistic. He is, however, the subject of heroic assistance from anti-Nazi Germans. In a sense, the protagonist of the film is not the Tracy character but a humble German worker played by [[Hume Cronyn]], who changes from Nazi sympathizer to active opponent of the regime as he aids Tracy.

After World War II ended, Zinnemann learned that both of his parents had died in the [[Holocaust]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=XyZSSDISXikC&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=zinnemann+holocaust&source=bl&ots=YD57fWqYl5&sig=8lWeI8GNvsA5rEQwQYVERLYJpIU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Bm9IT4XhJsyJtwfb7YzvAg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=zinnemann%20holocaust&f=false Google Books]</ref> He was further frustrated by his studio contract, which dictated that he did not have a choice in directing films like ''[[My Brother Talks to Horses]]'' (1947) and ''[[Little Mr. Jim]]'' (1947) despite his lack of interest in their subject matter.<ref name="books.google.com">[http://books.google.com/books?id=SiK_3d6a7DQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=fred+zinnemann&hl=en&sa=X&ei=229IT7DGO4bGtgfX95juAg&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=horses&f=false Google Books]</ref> However, his next film, ''[[The Search]]'' (1948), won an Oscar for screenwriting and secured his position in the Hollywood establishment. Shot in war-ravaged Germany, the film stars [[Montgomery Clift]] in his screen debut as a [[G.I. (military)|GI]] who cares for a lost Czech boy traumatised by the war. It was followed by ''[[Act of Violence]]'' (1948), a gritty [[film noir]] starring [[Van Heflin]] as a haunted POW, [[Robert Ryan]] as his hot-tempered former friend, [[Janet Leigh]] as Heflin's wife, and [[Mary Astor]] as a sympathetic prostitute. Zinnemann considered ''Act of Violence'' the first project in which he "felt comfortable knowing exactly what I wanted and exactly how to get it."<ref name="books.google.com"/>

===1950s===
In the critically acclaimed ''[[The Men (film)|The Men]]'' (1950), starring newcomer Marlon Brando as a [[paraplegic]] war veteran, Zinnemann filmed many scenes in a California hospital where real patients served as extras. The film is noted for giving Brando his first screen role. It was followed by ''[[Teresa (film)|Teresa]]'' (1951), starring [[Pier Angeli]].

Perhaps Zinnemann's best-known work to come out of the 1950s is ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), one of the first 25 American films chosen in 1989 for the [[National Film Registry]]. With its psychological and moral examinations of its lawman hero Marshall Will Kane, played by [[Gary Cooper]] and its innovative chronology whereby screen time approximated the 80-minute countdown to the confrontational hour, the film broke the mould of the formulaic western. Working closely with cinematographer and longtime friend [[Floyd Crosby]], he shot without filters, giving the landscape a harsh "newsreel" quality that clashed with the more painterly cinematography of John Ford's westerns.<ref>J. E. Smyth, "Fred Zinnemann and the Cinema of Resistance", Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2014. Pages 103-04.</ref> During production he established a strong rapport with [[Gary Cooper]], photographing the ageing actor in many tight close-ups which showed him sweating, and at one point, even crying on screen.

Screenwriter [[Carl Foreman]] apparently intended ''[[High Noon]]'' to be an allegory of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s vendetta against alleged Communists. However, Zinnemann disagreed, insisting, late in life, that the issues in the film, for him, were broader, and were more about conscience and independent, uncompromising, fearlessness. He says, "''High Noon'' is "not a Western, as far as I'm concerned; it just happens to be set in the Old West." And film critic [[Stephen Prince]] suggests that the character of Kane actually represents Zinnemann, who tried to create an atmosphere of impending threat on the horizon, a fear of potential "fascism", represented by the gang of killers soon arriving. Zinnemann explained the general context for many of his films: "One of the crucial things today [is] trying to preserve our civilization." Prince adds that Zinnemann, having learned that both his parents died in the Holocaust, wanted Kane willing to "fight rather than run", unlike everyone else in town. As a result, "Zinnemann allies himself" with the film's hero, Prince writes.<ref name=Nolletti>Prince, Stephen; Nolletti, Arthur, ed. ''The Films of Fred Zinnemann: Critical Perspectives'', State Univ. of N.Y. Press (1999) p. 86</ref> Zinnemann explains the theme of the film and its relevance to modern times:

{{quote|I saw it as a great movie yarn, full of enormously interesting people... only later did it dawn on me that this was ''not'' a regular Western myth. There was something timely -- and timeless -- about it, something that had a direct bearing on life today. To me it was the story of a man who must make a decision according to his conscience. His town -- symbol of a democracy gone soft -- faces a horrendous threat to its people's way of life. Determined to resist, and in deep trouble, he moves all over the place looking for support but finding that there is nobody who will help him; each has a reason of his own for not getting involved. In the end, he must meet his chosen fate all by himself, his town's doors and windows firmly locked against him. It is a story that still happens everywhere, every day.<ref>Fred Zinnemann, ''A Life in the Movies. An Autobiography'', Macmillan Books, 1992. Pages 96-97.</ref>}}

For his screen adaptation of the play ''[[The Member of the Wedding]]'' (1952), Zinnemann chose the 26-year-old [[Julie Harris]] as the film's 12-year-old [[protagonist]], although she had created the role on Broadway just as the two other leading actors, [[Ethel Waters]] and [[Brandon deWilde]], had.

Zinnemann's next film, ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953), based on the novel by [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]], was nominated for 13 [[Academy Awards]] and would go on to win 8, including Best Picture and Best Director. Zinnemann fought hard with producer [[Harry Cohn]] to cast [[Montgomery Clift]] as the character of Prewitt, although [[Frank Sinatra]], who was at the lowest point of his popularity, cast himself in the role of "Maggio" against Zinnemann's wishes.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=SiK_3d6a7DQC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=sinatra+%22He+picked+himself.%22&source=bl&ots=NpzAQvT3Lm&sig=FW9fsLp4gB1Pt3BNuknuAq-mMzA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DH1IT9HjCZSXtwew8dzuAg&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=sinatra%20%22He%20picked%20himself.%22&f=false Google Books]</ref> Sinatra would later win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. ''From Here to Eternity'' also featured [[Deborah Kerr]], best known for prim and proper roles, as a philandering Army wife. [[Donna Reed]] played the role of Alma "Lorene" Burke, a prostitute and mistress of Montgomery Clift's character which earned her an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for 1953.

''[[Oklahoma (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'' (1955), Zinnemann's version of the [[Richard Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Hammerstein]] musical, is noted for the wide screen format [[Todd-AO]] making its debut, as did the film's young star, [[Shirley Jones]]. It was followed by ''[[A Hatful of Rain]]'' (1957), starring [[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]], [[Eva Marie Saint]] and [[Anthony Franciosa]], and based on the play by [[Michael V. Gazzo]].

Zinnemann rounded out the 1950s with ''[[The Nun's Story]]'' (1959), casting [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the role of Sister Luke, a nun who eventually gives up the religious life to join the Belgian resistance in the Second World War. The film was based on the life of [[Marie Louise Habets]].  Hepburn, who gave up the chance to play Anne Frank in order to work on "[[The Nun's Story]]", considered the film to be her best and most personal work. Zinnemann's style of cutting from close-up to close-up was heavily influenced by Carl Theodor Dreyer's '[[Passion of Joan of Arc]]" (1928), his favourite film.

===1960s===
''[[The Sundowners]]'' (1960), starring [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Deborah Kerr]] as an [[Australian outback]] husband and wife, led to more Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actress (Kerr) and Best Supporting Actress ([[Glynis Johns]]), but won none. ''[[Behold a Pale Horse (film)|Behold A Pale Horse]]'' (1964) was a post-[[Spanish Civil War]] epic based on the book ''Killing A Mouse on Sunday'' by [[Emeric Pressburger]] and starred [[Gregory Peck]], [[Anthony Quinn]] and [[Omar Sharif]], but was both a critical and commercial flop; Zinnemann would later admit that the film "didn't really come together."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=SiK_3d6a7DQC&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153&dq=zinnemann+%22the+film+didn't+really+come+together%22&source=bl&ots=NpyIWvX_Ff&sig=xqSK5E2WzPR-7YuvuR5ssWA06fM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tS0zT4zVIoyJtwfrw8SxAg&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=zinnemann%20%22the%20film%20didn't%20really%20come%20together%22&f=false Google Books]</ref>

In 1965 he was a member of the jury at the [[4th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name="Moscow1965">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1965 |title=4th Moscow International Film Festival (1965) |accessdate=December 2, 2012 |work=MIFF}}</ref>

Zinnemann's fortunes changed once again with ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1966), scripted by [[Robert Bolt]] from his own play and starring [[Paul Scofield]] as [[Sir Thomas More]], portraying him as a man driven by conscience to his ultimate fate. The film went on to win six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Scofield) and Best Director, Zinnemann's second such Oscar to date. The film was also entered into the [[5th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name="Moscow1967">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1967 |title=5th Moscow International Film Festival (1967) |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |work=MIFF}}</ref>

After this, Zinnemann was all set to direct an adaptation of ''[[Man's Fate]]'' for [[MGM]]. However, the project was shut down in 1969, and the studio attempted to hold Zinnemann responsible for at least $1 million of the $3.5 million that had already been spent on pre-production. In protest, Zinnemann filed a lawsuit against the studio, and it would be four years before he would make his next film.<ref name="Zinnemann dies at 89">{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117342690.html?categoryid=38&cs=1 | work=Variety | first1=Timothy M. | last1=Gray | first2=Richard | last2=Natale | title=Zinnemann dies at 89 | date=March 17, 1997}}</ref>

===1970s===
By the early 1970s, Zinnemann had been out of work since the cancellation of ''Man's Fate''; he believed it had "marked the end of an era in picture making and the dawn of a new one, when lawyers and accountants began to replace showmen as head of the studios and when a handshake was a handshake no longer."<ref name="Zinnemann dies at 89"/> However, [[Universal Studios|Universal]] then offered him the chance to direct ''[[The Day of the Jackal (film)|The Day of the Jackal]]'' (1973), based on the best-selling suspense novel by [[Frederick Forsyth]]. The film starred [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as an Englishman who is relentlessly driven to complete his mission to try to kill French president [[Charles de Gaulle]], and [[Michael Lonsdale]] as the French detective hired to stop him. Zinnemann was intrigued by the opportunity to direct a film in which the audience would already be able to guess the ending (the Jackal failing his mission), and was pleased when it ultimately became a hit with the public.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=X2rpAGzeD-cC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=%22would+the+audience+sit+still%22&source=bl&ots=xVwXokYA-y&sig=MxJbllFgRDQOxyfCA44dI3iwh5M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rxs_T_nPEMX5tgeSuNWwBQ&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22would%20the%20audience%20sit%20still%22&f=false Google Books]</ref>

''The Day of the Jackal'' was followed four years later by ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'' (1977), based on the book ''[[Pentimento]]'' by [[Lillian Hellman]]. The film starred [[Jane Fonda]] as Hellman and [[Vanessa Redgrave]] as her best friend Julia, a doomed American [[Beneficiary|heiress]] who forsakes the safety and comfort of great wealth to devote her life to the [[anti-Nazi]] cause in Germany. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won three, for Best Screenplay ([[Alvin Sargent]]), Best Supporting Actor ([[Jason Robards]]), and Best Supporting Actress for Redgrave, who drew scattered boos on Oscar night for her "Zionist hoodlums" acceptance speech.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeGWxHvKs48 YouTube]</ref>

===1980s===
Zinnemann's final film was ''[[Five Days One Summer]]'' (1982), filmed in Switzerland and based on the short story ''Maiden, Maiden'' by [[Kay Boyle]]. It starred [[Sean Connery]] and [[Betsy Brantley]] as a "couple" vacationing in the [[Alps]] in the 1930s, and a young [[Lambert Wilson]] as a mountain-climbing guide who grows heavily suspicious of their relationship. The film was both a critical and commercial flop, although Zinnemann would be told by various critics in later years that they considered it an underrated achievement.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=X2rpAGzeD-cC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=%22five+days+one+summer%22+%22deserved+a+much+better%22&source=bl&ots=xVxOkmTt_r&sig=gVE1Xru2MS-Jte4N8HNJphUNUDs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OntIT-X-EsybtwfMkZ3vAg&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22five%20days%20one%20summer%22%20%22deserved%20a%20much%20better%22&f=false Google Books]</ref> Zinnemann blamed the film's critical and commercial failure for his retirement from filmmaking: "I'm not saying it was a good picture. But there was a degree of viciousness in the reviews. The pleasure some people took in tearing down the film really hurt."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-21/entertainment/ca-1509_1_fred-zinnemann | work=Los Angeles Times | first=David | last=Gritten | title=MOVIES : A Lion in His Winter : At 85, Fred Zinnemann looks back on a life in film; his anecdote-rich autobiography earns the rave reviews his last movie didn't | date=June 21, 1992}}</ref>

==Final years and death==
Zinnemann is often regarded as striking a blow against "[[ageism]]" in Hollywood. The apocryphal story goes that, in the 1980s, during a meeting with a young Hollywood executive, Zinnemann was surprised to find the executive didn't know who he was, despite having won four Academy Awards, and directing many of Hollywood's biggest films. When the young executive callowly asked Zinnemann to list what he had done in his career, Zinnemann delivered an elegant comeback by reportedly answering, "Sure. You first." In Hollywood, the story is known as "You First", and is often alluded to when veteran creators find that upstarts are unfamiliar with their work.<ref>{{cite news

Zinnemann insisted, "I've been trying to disown that story for years. It seems to me Billy Wilder told it to me about himself."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-21/entertainment/ca-1509_1_fred-zinnemann/2 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=David | last=Gritten | title=MOVIES : A Lion in His Winter : At 85, Fred Zinnemann looks back on a life in film; his anecdote-rich autobiography earns the rave reviews his last movie didn't | date=June 21, 1992}}</ref>

Zinnemann died of a heart attack in London, England on March 14, 1997. He was 89 years old. His wife died on December 18, 1997.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Directing style==
Zinnemann's training in documentary filmmaking and his personal background contributed to his style as a "[[social realist]]." With his early films between 1937 and 1942 he began using that technique, and with ''High Noon'' in 1952, possibly his finest film, he created the tense atmosphere by coordinating screen time with real time.<ref name=Hillstrom/>

Zinnemann's films are all dramas of lone and principled individuals tested by tragic events, including ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953); ''[[The Nun's Story (film)|The Nun's Story]]'' (1959); ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man For All Seasons]]'' (1966); and ''[[Julia (1977 film)|Julia]]'' (1977). Regarded as a consummate craftsman, Zinnemann traditionally endowed his work with meticulous attention to detail to create realism, and had an intuitive gift for casting and a preoccupation with the moral dilemmas of his characters.

In ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'', for example, he effectively added actual newsreel footage of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which enhanced and dramatized the story. Similarly, in ''A Hatful of Rain'', he used a documentary style to present real life drug addiction in New York. Zinnemann again incorporated newsreel footage in ''Behold a Pale Horse'', about the Spanish Civil War. ''The Day of the Jackal'', a political thriller about an attempt to assassinate [[Charles de Gaulle]], was shot on location in newsreel style, while ''Julia'' placed the characters in authentic settings, as in a suspenseful train journey from Paris to Moscow during World War II.<ref name=Hillstrom/> According to one historian, Zinnemann's style "demonstrates the director's sense of psychological realism and his apparent determination to make worthwhile pictures that are nevertheless highly entertaining."<ref name=Hillstrom/>
