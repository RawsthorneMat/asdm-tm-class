==Movie actress==

In Australia Gregory was known as the child wonder of the [[vaudeville]]
stage. Her first screen experience came at the age of four when she was shown in her mother's arms in a crowd which was welcoming British dignitaries.

She was first signed in [[Hollywood]] for [[ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] roles by [[Universal Pictures]] in 1921. She also worked for [[Hal Roach]] Studios and [[First National Pictures]]. In all she spent five years in comic roles before going into dramatic work. By 1924 she was the leading lady of the Independent Pictures Corporation. She was a Wampas Baby Star of 1925.

Gregory's film career started with comedy shorts like ''The Bull Thrower'' (1920), ''Lion's Jaws and Kitten's Paws'' (1920), and ''The Whizbang'' (1921). After completing ''The Calgary Stampede'' (1925) and ''The Chip of the Flying U'' (1926), with [[Hoot Gibson]], she was promoted to leading lady for [[Jack Hoxie]], for two movies.

==Name change==

When Gregory failed to achieve stardom by losing chances due to illness
and other causes, she consulted a Hollywood seer named Dareos. He suggested a new name which combined the syllables of Mary Pickford and
Douglas Fairbanks. It was Marian Douglas. Her first film using the new
name was ''The Shepherd of the Hills'' (1928). She took steps to become
an American citizen beginning in October 1927.

Gregory continued to make movies as Marion Douglas until 1931. Her final films are ''Twisted Tales'' (1931), ''Three Wise Clucks'' (1931), ''Aloha'' (1931), and ''Beach Pajamas'' (1931).

==Marriage and divorce==

Gregory divorced film director Alfred Rogell in August 1934. [[Beverly Hills, California]] attorney, William V.R. Smith, was named a co-respondent in a $150,000 lawsuit brought by Rogell. Gregory was awarded a temporary alimony sum of $300 per month from Rogell. Gregory
married Dr. Frank Nolan on 5 November 1937. The couple separated in May 1938 and Gregory obtained a divorce decree in July 1939.

Ena Gregory died in [[Laguna Beach, California]] in 1993, aged 87.
