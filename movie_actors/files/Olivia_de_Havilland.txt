==Early life==
Olivia de Havilland was born on July 1, 1916, in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], to parents from the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. Her father, [[Walter Augustus de Havilland]] (August 31, 1872 – May 23, 1968), was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]] and served as an English professor at the [[University of Tokyo|Imperial University]] in Tokyo before becoming a [[patent attorney]] with a practice in Japan.<ref name="thomas-20">Thomas 1983, p. 20.</ref> Her mother, [[Lillian Fontaine|Lilian Augusta]] (née Ruse; June 11, 1886 – February 20, 1975),<ref name="peerage">[http://www.thepeerage.com/p18366.htm "Olivia Mary de Havilland at ''ThePeerage.com'']; retrieved February 15, 2013.</ref><ref name="filmref">[http://www.filmreference.com/film/75/Olivia-de-Havilland.html Olivia de Havilland profile at FilmReference.com]; retrieved February 15, 2013.</ref> was educated at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London and became a stage actress who left her career after going to Tokyo with her husband.<ref name="thomas-20"/> Her mother would return to work with the stage name '''Lillian Fontaine''' after her daughters achieved fame in the 1940s. Olivia's paternal cousin was Sir [[Geoffrey de Havilland]] (1882–1965), an aircraft designer, notably of the [[De Havilland Mosquito]],<ref name="french">French, Philip. "Screen Legends No.73". ''The Observer'', Review Section, 2009.</ref> and founder of the aircraft company which bore his name.

[[File:Olivia De Haviland 1933.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Olivia de Havilland in the stage play ''Alice in Wonderland'', 1933]]
De Havilland's parents married in 1914, but the marriage was not a happy one due to her father's infidelities.<ref name="thomas-22">Thomas 1983, p. 22.</ref> Her younger sister, Joan de Havilland (later known as actress [[Joan Fontaine]]), was born on October 22, 1917. In February 1919, Lillian persuaded her husband to take the family back to England to a climate better suited for their ailing daughters.<ref name="thomas-22"/> The family stopped in California to treat Olivia's bronchial condition and high temperature. After Joan developed pneumonia, Lillian decided to remain with her daughters in California, where they settled in the village of [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]], about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south of [[San Francisco Bay|San Francisco]]. Her father abandoned the family and returned to his Japanese housekeeper, who would eventually become his second wife.<ref name="thomas-22"/> Her parents' divorce was not finalized until February 1925.<ref name="thomas-23">Thomas 1983, p. 23.</ref>

Although she left the acting profession, Lillian taught her daughters to appreciate the arts, reading [[Shakespeare in Love|Shakespeare]] to her children.{{#tag:ref|Olivia was named after the character in ''[[Twelfth Night]]''.|group=Note}} She also taught them music and [[elocution]].<ref name="thomas-24">Thomas 1983, p. 24.</ref> In April 1925, after her divorce was finalized, Lillian remarried, this time to a department store owner named George M. Fontaine, whose strict parenting soon generated animosity in his new stepdaughters. Only a year apart, the sisters also developed a rivalry between themselves that would last throughout their lives.<ref name="cornwell">Cornwell, Rupert.

After graduating high school in 1934, de Havilland was offered the role of Puck in the Saratoga Community Theater production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.<ref name="thomas-26"/> That summer, Austrian director [[Max Reinhardt]] came to California for a major new production of the same play at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. After one of Reinhardt's assistants saw Olivia perform in the Saratoga production, he offered her the understudy position for the role of [[Hermia (Finland)|Hermia]].<ref name="thomas-27">Thomas 1983, p. 27.</ref> One week before the premiere, the actress playing Hermia left to take a part in a film, and de Havilland took her place.

Wanting to become an English teacher,<ref name="thomas-27"/> she was going to matriculate at [[Mills College]] with a scholarship in the fall but Reinhardt persuaded her to accept.

==Career==
[[File:Olivia de Havilland in The Adventures of Robin Hood trailer.JPG|thumb|Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marian in ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'', 1938]]
Olivia de Havilland made her screen debut in Max Reinhardt's film ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', which was released in October 1935, following the release of her second and third films, ''[[Alibi Ike]]'' with [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]] and ''[[The Irish in Us]]'' with [[James Cagney]], respectively.<ref name="thomas-28"/><ref name="Brown125">Brown 1995, p. 125.</ref> All three films received mixed reviews and disappointing public response.<ref name="thomas-28"/> At this point, Warner Bros. made a decision that would have a profound impact on her career, pairing her with an unknown Tasmanian actor named [[Errol Flynn]] in ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' (1935). The casting of de Havilland was due to producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] wanting to showcase his "protege".<ref>Wallis and Higham 1990, p. 86.</ref> The popular success of the film, as well as the critical response to the on-screen couple,<ref name="thomas-29">Thomas 1983, p. 29.</ref> led to seven additional collaborations, including ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1936), ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938), ''[[Dodge City (1939 film)|Dodge City]]'' (1939), ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' (1940), and ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' (1941).<ref name="thomas-29"/>

[[File:De Havilland-Melanie.jpg|thumb|left|Studio publicity portrait for ''Gone With the Wind'', 1939]]
Throughout the late 1930s, de Havilland appeared in a variety of light romantic comedy films, including ''[[Call It a Day]]'' (1937), ''[[Four's a Crowd]]'' (1938), and ''[[Hard to Get (1938 film)|Hard to Get]]'' (1938), as well as period films such as ''[[Anthony Adverse]]'' (1936) and ''[[The Great Garrick]]'' (1937). Her refined demeanor and beautiful diction made her particularly effective in the latter films.<ref name="thomas-30">Thomas 1983, p. 30.</ref> While her performances were generally well received by critics and the public, they did not advance her career toward the more serious roles she desired.<ref name="thomas-30"/> One such role was the character of [[Melanie Hamilton]] in [[David O. Selznick]]'s upcoming film adaptation of [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s epic novel ''[[Gone with the Wind]]''. Having read the novel, de Havilland knew she could bring the character to life on the screen. According to some sources, her sister [[Joan Fontaine]] was approached by director [[George Cukor]] to audition for the role. Interested more in playing Scarlett O'Hara, Fontaine reportedly turned him down, recommending her sister.<ref name="thomas-30"/> Ultimately, [[Jack Warner]]'s wife Ann was instrumental in de Havilland getting the part.<ref name="thomas-32">Thomas 1983, p. 32.</ref> She was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.<ref name="oscars-1940">[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearch?action=searchLink&displayType=1&BSFromYear=12 "Results 1939 (12th) Academy Awards."] ''Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences''.

[[File:Santa Fe Trail De Havilland Flynn.jpg|thumb|upright|Olivia de Havilland and Errol Flynn in ''Santa Fe Trail'', 1940]]
Following the critical acclaim she received for her performance in ''Gone with the Wind'', de Havilland sought more serious and challenging roles, but was not supported in her efforts by Warner Bros. After receiving third billing in ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939) starring Bette Davis and Errol Flynn, she was loaned out to [[Samuel Goldwyn]] for the crime drama ''[[Raffles (1939 film)|Raffles]]'' (1939), and then assigned to the light musical comedy ''[[My Love Came Back]]'' (1940).<ref name="thomas-33">Thomas 1983, p. 33.</ref> Throughout the early 1940s, de Havilland was becoming increasingly frustrated by the roles assigned to her, which she felt were unchallenging and insubstantial.<ref name="thomas-33"/><ref name="thomas-153">Thomas 1983, p. 153.</ref> Feeling she had proven herself capable of playing more than the demure ingénues and damsels in distress that were typecasting her, she began to reject scripts that offered her this type of role and actively sought out better roles. She concluded her long series of popular films with Errol Flynn with ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' (1940) and ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' (1941), which contained some of their most telling scenes together.<ref name="thomas-33"/> Other highlights from this period include ''[[The Strawberry Blonde]]'' (1941) with [[James Cagney]], ''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]'' (1941) with [[Charles Boyer]] for which she received fine reviews, and ''[[Princess O'Rourke]]'' (1943), which she considered one of the few truly satisfying characters she played for Warner Bros.<ref name="thomas-34">Thomas 1983, p. 34.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Initially, de Havilland refused to take the part of Princess Maria in ''Princess O'Rourke'' and, subsequently, was suspended by Jack Warner.<ref>Freedland 1983, p. 172.</ref>|group=Note}} In 1942, de Havilland received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her performance in ''Hold Back the Dawn''.

[[File:Santa Fe Trail 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Studio publicity portrait for ''Santa Fe Trail'', 1940]]
After fulfilling her seven-year Warner Bros. contract with ''[[The Male Animal]]'' (1942), 
''[[In This Our Life]]'' (1942), ''[[Government Girl]]'' (1944), and ''[[Devotion (1946 film)|Devotion]]'' (1946), her last Warner Bros. film completed in 1943 and released in 1946, de Havilland was informed that six months had been added to her contract for times she had been on suspension.<ref name="thomas-35">Thomas 1983, p. 35.</ref> The law then allowed studios to suspend contract players for rejecting a role, and the period of suspension could be added to the contract period. Most contract players accepted this, but a few tried to change the system, including [[Bette Davis]] who mounted an unsuccessful lawsuit against Warner Bros. in the 1930s. In August 1943, on the advice of her lawyer, de Havilland took Warner Bros. to court and was supported by the [[Screen Actors Guild]]. The [[Supreme Court of California]] ruled in her favor (case #487, 685).<ref name="thomas-36">Thomas 1983, p. 36.</ref> The decision was one of the most significant and far-reaching legal rulings in Hollywood, reducing the power of the studios and extending greater creative freedom to performers.

Following the release of ''[[Devotion (1946 film)|Devotion]]''—a highly fictionalized biography of the [[Brontë|Brontë sisters]] filmed in 1943 but withheld from release during the suspension and litigation—de Havilland signed a three picture deal with [[Paramount Pictures]]. The quality and variety of her roles began to improve. In his review of ''[[The Dark Mirror (film)|The Dark Mirror]]'' (1946), [[James Agee]] noted the change, writing that although she had always been "one of the prettiest women in movies", her recent performances had proven her acting ability. He also noted that while not possessing "any remarkable talent", her performances are "thoughtful, quiet, detailed, and well sustained". Agee concluded that her acting is "founded, as some more talented playing is not, in an unusually healthful-seeming and likable temperament, it is an undivided pleasure to see".<ref>Shipman 1970, p. 151.</ref> De Havilland received the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performances in ''[[To Each His Own (film)|To Each His Own]]'' (1946) and ''[[The Heiress]]'' (1949), and was also widely praised for her Academy Award–nominated performance in ''[[The Snake Pit]]'' (1948), one of the earliest films to attempt a realistic portrayal of [[mental illness]] and an "historically important Hollywood exposé of the grim conditions in state mental hospitals".<ref name="french">French, Philip.

In June, 1946, she was asked to deliver speeches for the committee that reflected the Communist Party line (the group was later identified as a communist front organization).<ref>Billingsley 1998, pp. 123–124.</ref> Disturbed by the reports of [[Stalinist]] atrocities and how a small group of Communist members were manipulating the committee, de Havilland removed the pro-Communist material from her speeches and rewrote them to reflect [[Harry S. Truman]]'s anti-Communist program.<ref name="Record Straight 2006"/> She later recalled, "I realized a nucleus of people was controlling the organization without a majority of the members of the board being aware of it. And I knew they had to be Communists."<ref name="Record Straight 2006"/> She organized a fight to regain control of the committee from its pro-Soviet leadership, but her reform efforts failed. Her resignation from the committee triggered a wave of resignations from other Hollywood figures, including her own star recruit to the reform camp, [[Ronald Reagan]], whose political trajectory after 1952 would be far more dramatic.<ref name="Record Straight 2006">Meroney, John.

She declined the role of [[Blanche DuBois]] in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', later explaining: "I had just given birth to my son.

Of her few film appearances in the 1960s, chiefly notable are de Havilland's role in ''[[Lady in a Cage]]'' (1964) as a crippled widow trapped in a lift and terrorised by intruders, [[Robert Aldrich]]'s ''[[Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'', and [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s TV film of [[Katherine Anne Porter]]'s novella ''[[Noon Wine]]'' (1966).

Fernandez asked the then president of Mexico Miguel Aleman to prolong a street in [[Coyoacán]], in [[Mexico City]] to his mansion to then name it ''Sweet Olivia''.<ref>[http://www.wikimexico.com/wps/portal/wm/wikimexico/periodos/mexico-contemporaneo/la-reconstruccion/vida-cotidiana/el-orgullo-de-la-seduccion-emilio-el-indio-fernandez ''El orgullo de la seducción: Emilio Fernández'']</ref>

===Marriages===
Olivia de Havilland was married twice. On January 24, 1946, she married [[Marcus Goodrich]], a Navy veteran, author, and screenwriter. They had one child, Benjamin Goodrich, who was born on December 1, 1949. The marriage ended in divorce in 1952. Their son Benjamin died on October 1, 1991 (aged 41) of [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], three weeks before the death of his father.<ref>Honan, William H.

On April 2, 1955, de Havilland married Pierre Galante, a journalist and editor of ''[[Paris Match]]''. They had one child, Gisèle Galante, who was born on July 18, 1956. Her marriage to Galante prompted de Havilland to move to Paris. She recounted her adjustments to Parisian life in her memoir, ''Every Frenchman Has One''. The couple separated in 1962, but did not divorce until 1979.<ref>Eyre, Hermione.

===Close friendships===
De Havilland was lifelong best friends with [[Bette Davis]] with whom she starred in ''[[Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964), ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939), ''[[It's Love I'm After]]'' (1937), and ''[[In This Our Life]]'' (1942). She remained a close friend of actress [[Gloria Stuart]] until Stuart's death in 2010, at the age of 100. In April 2008, she attended the Los Angeles funeral of [[Charlton Heston]]. In 2008, she was a surprise guest at the centennial tribute to Bette Davis.<ref>[http://www.oscars.org/events/past/2008/bettedavis/ "Centennial Tribute to Bette Davis".] ''Thew Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences''; retrieved September 1, 2013.</ref>

===Sibling rivalry===
Olivia de Havilland and her sister, [[Joan Fontaine]], are the only [[List of Academy Award winning families#Siblings|siblings to have won lead acting Academy Awards]]. Of the two sisters, de Havilland was the first to become an actress. When Fontaine tried to follow her lead, their mother, who allegedly favoured de Havilland, refused to let her use the family name professionally. According to biographer [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]], the sisters always had an uneasy relationship, starting in early childhood when de Havilland would rip up the clothes Fontaine had to wear as hand-me-downs, forcing Fontaine to sew them back together. A large part of the resentment between the sisters allegedly stemmed from Fontaine's belief that de Havilland was their mother's favorite child.<ref name=CharlesHigham>Higham 1984, p. 257.</ref>

[[File:Joan Fontaine and Gary Cooper.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Joan Fontaine and [[Gary Cooper]] at the Academy Awards, 1942]]
De Havilland and Fontaine were both nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in 1942. Fontaine won that year for her role in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]'' over de Havilland's performance in ''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]''. According to Higham, as Fontaine stepped forward to receive her award, she pointedly rejected de Havilland's attempts at congratulating her, and that de Havilland was both offended and embarrassed by her behavior. Their relationship was further strained when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about de Havilland's husband. Fontaine, however, tells a different story in her autobiography, explaining that she was paralyzed with surprise when she won the Academy Award, and that de Havilland insisted she get up to accept it. "Olivia took the situation very graciously," Fontaine wrote. "I was appalled that I'd won over my sister."<ref>{{cite book |last=Fontaine |first=Joan |date=1978 |title=No Bed of Roses: An Autobiography |location=New York |publisher=William Morrow and Company |page=136 |isbn=978-0-68803-344-6 }}</ref>
Several years later, when de Havilland stepped up to accept her Academy Award for Best Actress, she brushed past Fontaine, who was waiting with her hand extended.<ref name=CharlesHigham/> The relationship between the sisters continued to deteriorate, and may have caused the estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who secretly maintained a relationship with de Havilland.<ref name=CharlesHigham/> For years, both sisters refused to comment publicly about their relationship.

Contrary to press reports, the sisters continued their relationship after the 1940s.  After Fontaine's separation from her husband in 1952, de Havilland came to her apartment in New York often, and at least once spent Christmas together there, in 1961.  They were photographed laughing together at a party for [[Marlene Dietrich]] in 1967.<ref>http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/joan-fontaine-and-sister-olivia-de-havilland-during-marlene-news-photo/105274140/</ref> Joan also went to visit Olivia in Paris in 1969.<ref>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/joan-fontaine-olivia-de-havilland-666087?page=2</ref>

The final break between the sisters occurred in 1975. According to Fontaine, they stopped speaking because of a disagreement over their mother's cancer treatment. While de Havilland wanted their mother to be treated surgically, Fontaine opposed surgery due to their mother's advanced age. Fontaine also claimed that after their mother died, de Havilland did not make an effort to notify Fontaine, who was touring with a play at the time. Instead, de Havilland sent a telegram, which did not reach her sister until two weeks later at Fontaine's next engagement.<ref>{{YouTube|m9f7gjHkR9M|"RetroBites: Joan Fontaine - Sisters (1979)"}}, 2 December 2010.</ref>

The sibling feud ended with Fontaine's death in December 2013. Determined to have the last word on the matter, Fontaine once noted, "I married first, won the Oscar before Olivia did, and if I die first, she'll undoubtedly be livid because I beat her to it!"<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/joan-fontaine-academy-award-winning-actress-from-the-1940s-dies-at-96/2013/12/15/807d78e4-c5da-11df-94e1-c5afa35a9e59_story.html|title=Joan Fontaine profile in|work=The Washington Post|date= December 16, 2013|accessdate= December 16, 2013}}</ref> Following her sister's death, de Havilland released a statement saying she was "shocked and saddened" by the news.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/olivia-de-havilland-shocked-and-saddened-by-sister-joan-fontaines-death/|title=Olivia de Havilland "shocked and saddened" by sister Joan Fontaine's death|work=cbsnews.com|date=December 16, 2013|accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref>
