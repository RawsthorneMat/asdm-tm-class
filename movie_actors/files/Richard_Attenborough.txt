'''Richard Samuel Attenborough, Baron Attenborough''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|t|ən|b | ʌ|r | ə}}; 29 August 1923{{spaced ndash}}24 August 2014) was an English actor, film director, film producer, entrepreneur and politician. He was the President of the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) and the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA).

As a film director and producer, Attenborough won two [[Academy Award]]s for ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' in 1983. He also won four [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] and four [[Golden Globe Award]]s. As an actor, he is perhaps best known for his roles in ''[[Brighton Rock (1947 film)|Brighton Rock]]'', ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', ''[[10 Rillington Place]]'', ''[[Miracle on 34th Street (1994 film)|Miracle on 34th Street]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.<ref>"[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000277/filmovote Filmography by votes for Richard Attenborough]", IMDb. Retrieved 27 March 2011.</ref>

He was the older brother of [[David Attenborough]], a [[naturalist]] and broadcaster, and [[John Attenborough]], an executive at [[Alfa Romeo]]. He was married to actress [[Sheila Sim]] from 1945 until his death. Their daughter and one of their grandchildren were killed in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]].

==Early life==
Attenborough was born on 29 August 1923<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1398450/Richard-Attenborough |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=9 November 2013 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref> in [[Cambridge]], the eldest of three sons of Mary Attenborough (née Clegg), a founding member of the [[Marriage Guidance Council]], and [[Frederick Attenborough|Frederick Levi Attenborough]], a scholar and academic administrator who was a fellow at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], and wrote a standard text on [[Anglo-Saxon]] law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/38/Richard-Attenborough.html |title=Richard Attenborough profile at |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/person/richard-attenborough/biography.html |title=Richard Attenborough Biography |publisher=Movies.yahoo.com |accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref> Attenborough was educated at [[Wyggeston and Queen Elizabeth I College|Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys]] in [[Leicester]] and studied at [[RADA]].

In September 1939, the Attenboroughs took in two German [[Kindertransport|Jewish refugee]] girls, Helga and Irene Bejach (aged 9 and 11 respectively), who lived with them in College House and were adopted by the family after the war when it was discovered that their parents had been killed.  The sisters moved to America in the 1950s and lived with an uncle, where they married and took American citizenship; Irene died in 1992 and Helga in 2005.<ref>''Entirely Up To You, Darling'' by Diana Hawkins & Richard Attenborough; pages 29–30; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009; ISBN 978-0-099-50304-0</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1166729/Sir-Richard-Attenborough-remembers-Kindertransport.html |title=Sir Richard Attenborough remembers Kindertransport |publisher=Daily Mail |accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref>

During the [[Second World War]], Attenborough served in the [[Royal Air Force]]. After initial pilot training he was seconded to the newly formed [[Royal Air Force Film Production Unit|R.A.F. Film Unit]] at [[Pinewood Studios]], under the command of Flight Lieutenant [[John Boulting]] (whose brother [[Peter Cotes]] would later direct Attenborough in the play ''[[The Mousetrap]]'') where he appeared with [[Edward G. Robinson]] in the propaganda film ''Journey Together'' (1943). He then volunteered to fly with the Film Unit and after further training, where he sustained permanent ear damage, qualified as a sergeant, flying on several missions over Europe filming from the rear gunner's position to record the outcome of [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] sorties.<ref>''Entirely Up To You, Darling'' by Diana Hawkins & Richard Attenborough; pp. 88–95; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009; ISBN 978-0-099-50304-0</ref>

==Acting career==
Attenborough's acting career started on stage and he appeared in shows at Leicester's [[Little Theatre (Leicester)|Little Theatre]], Dover Street, prior to his going to [[RADA]], where he remained Patron until his death. Attenborough's film career began in 1942 in an uncredited role as a sailor deserting his post under fire in the [[Noël Coward]]/[[David Lean]] production ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' (his name and character were accidentally omitted from the original release-print credits), a role which would help to type-cast him for many years as a [[spiv]] or coward in films like ''[[London Belongs to Me]]'' (1948), ''[[Morning Departure]]'' (1950) and his breakthrough role as [[Pinkie Brown]] in [[John Boulting]]'s film adaptation of [[Graham Greene]]'s novel ''[[Brighton Rock (1947 film)|Brighton Rock]]'' (1947), a part that he had previously played to great acclaim at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in 1942.

In 1949, exhibitors voted him the sixth most popular British actor at the box office.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2759831 |title=Bob Hope Takes Lead from Bing In Popularity. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] (ACT: 1926–1954) |location=ACT |date=31 December 1949 |accessdate=27 April 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Early in his stage career, Attenborough starred in the [[West End theatre|West End]] production of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[The Mousetrap]]'', which went on to become the world's longest running stage production. Both he and his wife were among the original cast members of the production, which opened in 1952 at the [[Ambassadors Theatre]] and as of 2014 is still running at the [[St Martins Theatre]]. They took a 10% profit-participation in the production, which was paid for out of their combined weekly salary ("It proved to be the wisest business decision I've ever made... but foolishly I sold some of my share to open a short-lived Mayfair restaurant called 'The Little Elephant' and later still, disposed of the remainder in order to keep ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' afloat.")<ref>''Entirely Up To You, Darling'' by Diana Hawkins & Richard Attenborough; page 180; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009; ISBN 978-0-099-50304-0</ref>

[[File:Richard Attenborough - 1965.jpg|thumb|upright|in ''Flight of the Phoenix'' (1965)]]
Attenborough worked prolifically in British films for the next 30 years, including in the 1950s, appearing in several successful comedies for [[Boulting brothers|John and Roy Boulting]], such as ''[[Private's Progress]]'' (1956) and ''[[I'm All Right Jack]]'' (1959).

In 1963, he appeared in the ensemble cast of ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' as RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett ("Big X"), the head of the escape committee, based on the real-life exploits of [[Roger Bushell]]. It was his first appearance in a major Hollywood film blockbuster and his most successful film thus far. During the 1960s, he expanded his range of character roles in films such as ''[[Séance on a Wet Afternoon]]'' (1964) and ''[[Guns at Batasi]]'' (1964), for which he won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal of the [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] (RSM). In 1965 he played Lew Moran opposite [[James Stewart]] in ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film)|The Flight of the Phoenix]]'' and in 1967 and 1968, he won back-to-back [[Golden Globe Awards]] in the category of [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actor]], the first time for ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'', again co-starring [[Steve McQueen]], and the second time for ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]]'' starring [[Rex Harrison]].

His portrayal of the [[serial killer]] [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]] in ''[[10 Rillington Place]]'' (1971) garnered excellent reviews. In 1977, he played the ruthless [[Sir James Outram, 1st Baronet|General Outram]], again to great acclaim, in the Indian director [[Satyajit Ray]]'s period piece ''[[Shatranj Ke Khilari|The Chess Players]]''.

He took no acting roles following his appearance in [[Otto Preminger]]'s version of ''[[The Human Factor]]'' (1979) until his appearance as the eccentric developer John Hammond in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993) and the film's sequel, ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' (1997). He starred in the remake of ''[[Miracle on 34th Street (1994 film)|Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1994) as [[Santa Claus|Kris Kringle]]. Later he made occasional appearances in supporting roles, including as [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Sir William Cecil]] in the historical drama ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]'' (1998), Jacob in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (film)|Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' and as "The Narrator" in the [[Puckoon#Film|film adaptation]] of [[Spike Milligan]]'s comedy book ''[[Puckoon]]'' (2002).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2002/jul/23/artsfeatures |location=London, UK |work=The Guardian |first=Bob |last=Flynn |title=Arts: Filming Spike Milligan's Puckoon |date=2 August 2002}}</ref>

He made his only appearance in a film adaptation of [[Shakespeare]] when he played the British ambassador who announces that [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]] are dead at the end of [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1996).<ref name="imdb" />

==Producer and director==
In the late 1950s, Attenborough formed a production company, Beaver Films, with [[Bryan Forbes]] and began to build a profile as a producer on projects including ''[[The League of Gentlemen (film)|The League of Gentlemen]]'' (1959), ''[[The Angry Silence]]'' (1960) and ''[[Whistle Down the Wind (film)|Whistle Down the Wind]]'' (1961), appearing in the cast of the first two films.<ref name="imdb" />

His feature film directorial debut was the all-star screen version of the hit musical ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]'' (1969), after which his acting appearances became sporadic as he concentrated more on directing and producing. He later directed two epic period films: ''[[Young Winston]]'' (1972), based on the early life of [[Winston Churchill]], and ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (1977), an all-star account of [[Operation Market Garden|Operation ''Market Garden'']] in [[World War II]].<ref name="imdb" />

He won the 1982 [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and as the film's producer, the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] for his historical epic ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' and another two [[Golden Globes]], this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Film]], for the same film in 1983, a project he had been attempting to get made for 18 years. Attenborough also directed [[A Chorus Line (film)|the screen version]] of the musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' (1985) and the anti-[[apartheid]] drama ''[[Cry Freedom]]'' (1987), based on the life and death of prominent anti-[[apartheid]] activist [[Steve Biko]] and the experiences of [[Donald Woods]]. He was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]] for both films.<ref name="imdb">{{IMDb name|0000277}}</ref>

His most recent films as director and producer include ''[[Chaplin (film)|Chaplin]]'' (1992) starring [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], as [[Charlie Chaplin]] and ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993), based on the relationship between [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[Joy Davidman|Joy Gresham]] (the star of the latter was [[Anthony Hopkins]], who had appeared in four previous films for Attenborough: ''Young Winston'', ''A Bridge Too Far'', ''[[Magic (1978 film)|Magic]]'' and ''Chaplin''). Between 2006-07, he spent time in [[Belfast]], working on his last film as director and producer, ''[[Closing the Ring]]'', a love story set in Belfast during the [[Second World War]] and starring [[Shirley MacLaine]], [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Pete Postlethwaite]].<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i66abf6954df1d43ff4b99604a6253a3c Works nabs U.K. rights to ''Closing The Ring''] from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''</ref>

==Later projects==

After 33 years of dedicated service as President of the [[Muscular Dystrophy]] campaign, Attenborough became the charity's Honorary Life President in 2004. In 2012, the charity, which leads the fight against muscle-wasting conditions in the UK, established the Richard Attenborough Fellowship Fund to honour his lifelong commitment to the charity, and to ensure the future of clinical research and training at leading UK neuromuscular centres.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muscular-dystrophy.org/waystodonate/fund_a_scientist/richard_attenborough_fellowship_fund |title=Richard Attenborough Fellowship Fund |publisher=Muscular-dystrophy.org |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>

Attenborough was also the patron of the [[United World Colleges]] movement, whereby he contributed to the colleges that are part of the organisation. He was a frequent visitor to the [[Waterford Kamhlaba]] [[United World Colleges|United World College]] of Southern Africa (UWCSA). With his wife, they founded the Richard and Sheila Attenborough Visual Arts Centre. He also founded the '''Jane Holland Creative Centre for Learning at Waterford Kamhlaba''' in [[Swaziland]] in memory of his daughter who died in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami on 26 December 2004]].

He was a longtime advocate of education that does not judge upon colour, race, creed or religion. His attachment to Waterford was his passion for non-racial education, which were the grounds on which Waterford Kamhlaba was founded. Waterford was one of his inspirations for directing the film ''[[Cry Freedom]]'', based on the life of [[Steve Biko]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

He was elected to the post of [[Chancellor]] of the [[University of Sussex]] on 20 March 1998, replacing [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 10th Duke of Richmond|The Duke of Richmond and Gordon]]. He stood down as Chancellor of the university following graduation in July 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/search/2235631.Lord_Attenborough_steps_down_as_Sussex_University_chancellor_/ |title=Lord Attenborough steps down as Sussex University chancellor |first=Richard |last=Gurner |work=The Argus |location=Brighton |accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref> There now hangs a 42&nbsp;inch by 46&nbsp;inch portrait of him in the university's library.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/press_office/bulletin/31oct08/article13.shtml |title=Bulletin – 31 October 2008 |publisher=Sussex.ac.uk |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref>

A lifelong supporter of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea Football Club]], Attenborough served as a director of the club from 1969–1982 and between 1993 and 2008 held the honorary position of Life Vice President. On 30 November 2008 he was honoured with the title of Life President at the club's stadium, [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. He was also head of the consortium [[Dragon International Film Studios]], which was constructing a film and television studio complex in [[Llanilid]], [[Wales]], nicknamed "Valleywood". In March 2008, the project was placed into administration with debts of £15 million and the site is believed to be being considered for breaking-up with a sale of the assets.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-12632138 |work=BBC News |title=Valleywood film studios faces possible sell-off |date=3 March 2011}}</ref>

He had a lifelong ambition to make a film about his hero the political theorist and revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]], whom he called "one of the finest men that ever lived". He said in an interview in 2006 that "I could understand him. He wrote in simple English. I found all his aspirations – the rights of women, the health service, universal education... Everything you can think of that we want is in [[Rights of Man]] or [[The Age of Reason]] or [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/06/tsunami2004.worldcinema |title=Richard Attenborough on laughter, levity and the loss of his daughter |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Simon |last=Hattenstone |date=6 September 2008 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2009/09/pain-s18.html |title=A New World: A Life of Thomas Paine by Trevor Griffiths |work=World Socialist Website |author=Ann Talbot |date=18 September 2009 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/filmchat/2008/06/flashback-sir-richard-attenborough-the-grey-owl-interview.html |title=Flashback: Sir Richard Attenborough, the Grey Owl interview |work=Patheos |author=Peter T.

==Personal life==
[[File:Sir Richard Attenborough.jpg|thumb|Lord Attenborough during his term as Chancellor of the [[University of Sussex]], February 2006]]
Attenborough's father was the principal of [[University of Leicester|University College, Leicester]], now the city's university. This resulted in a long association with the university, with Attenborough becoming a patron. The university's Embrace Arts at the RA centre,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.embracearts.co.uk |title=index — University of Leicester |publisher=Embracearts.co.uk |date= |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref> which opened in 1997 is named in his honour. He had two younger brothers: naturalist and broadcaster [[David Attenborough|David]]; and [[John Attenborough|John]] (died 2012), who had made a career in the [[car dealership|motor trade]].

Attenborough married actress [[Sheila Sim]] in 1945. From 1949 until October 2012 they lived in Beaver Lodge on [[Richmond Green]] in London. The house was sold in October 2012 for £11.5 million, owing to the couple's deteriorating health.<ref name=Telg9430222 />

On 26 December 2004 the couple's eldest daughter, 49-year-old Jane Holland, as well as her mother-in-law, also named Jane, and Attenborough's 15-year-old granddaughter, Lucy, were killed when a tsunami caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean earthquake]] struck [[Khao Lak]], Thailand, where they were on holiday.<ref name="2004 tsunami">{{cite news |last=Pook |first=Sally |title=Attenborough family's fatal tsunami decision |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1504959/Attenborough-familys-fatal-tsunami-decision.html |accessdate=5 June 2011 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=8 December 2005 |location=London}}</ref> A service was held on 8 March 2005 and Attenborough read a lesson at the national memorial service on 11 May 2005. His grandson Samuel Holland, an actor in his own right, who survived the tsunami uninjured, and granddaughter Alice Holland, who suffered severe leg injuries, also read in the service. A commemorative plaque was placed in the floor of St. Mary Magdalen's parish church in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]]. Attenborough later described the Boxing Day of 2004 as "the worst day of my life". Attenborough had two other children, [[Michael Attenborough|Michael]] and Charlotte. Michael was a theatre director and the former [[artistic director]] of the [[Almeida Theatre]] in London and has been married to actress Karen Lewis since 1984; they have two sons. Charlotte is an actress, and has three children.

Attenborough collected [[Picasso]] [[ceramic art|ceramics]] from the 1950s. More than 100 items went on display at the [[New Walk Museum]] and Art Gallery in Leicester in 2007, in an exhibition dedicated to family members lost in the tsunami.<ref>[http://www.leicester.gov.uk/picasso/index.htm Leicester City Council]{{Dead link|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article1808736.ece |title=Richard Attenborough's Picasso ceramics |work=Times Online |accessdate=3 September 2011 |location=London |first=Greg |last=Hurst}}</ref>

In 2008 he published an informal autobiography entitled ''Entirely Up to You, Darling'' in association with his long-standing friend and colleague Diana Hawkins. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Declining health and death===
In August 2008 Attenborough entered hospital with heart problems and was fitted with a [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]]. In December 2008 he suffered a fall at his home after a [[stroke]],<ref name=Telg9954199 /> and was admitted to [[St George's Hospital]] in [[Tooting]], southwest London. In November 2009 Attenborough, in what he called a "house clearance" sale, sold part of his extensive art collection, which included works by [[L. S. Lowry]], [[Christopher R. W. Nevinson]] and [[Graham Sutherland]], generating £4.6 million at [[Sotheby's]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Adams |first=Stephen |title=Lord Attenborough's picture sale makes £4.6m at Sotheby's |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6546233/Lord-Attenboroughs-picture-sale-makes-4.6m-at-Sothebys.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=11 November 2009}}</ref>

In June 2012, shortly before her 90th birthday, Sheila Sim entered the actors' home [[Denville Hall]], for which she and Attenborough had helped raise funds.

In October 2012, it was announced that Attenborough was putting the family home, Old Friars, with its attached offices, Beaver Lodge, which come complete with a sound-proofed cinema in the garden, on the market for £11.5 million.

==Honours==
Attenborough was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in December 1962 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the Savoy Hotel, during a dinner held to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the [[Agatha Christie]] play ''[[The Mousetrap]]'', in which he had been an original cast member.<ref name="imdb" />

In 1967, he was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE). He was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1976 and in 1993 he was made a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Attenborough''', of [[Richmond, London|Richmond upon Thames]] in the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.burkes-peerage.net/familyhomepage.aspx?FID=0&FN=ATTENBOROUGH |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110811022430/http://www.burkespeerage.com/familyhomepage.aspx?FID=0&FN=ATTENBOROUGH |archivedate=11 August 2011 |title=Burke's Peerage – Preview Family Record |publisher=Burkes-peerage.net |accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref><ref name="Gazette">{{London Gazette|issue=53397|date=10 August 1993|startpage=13291 |city=1|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref> Although the appointment by [[John Major]] was 'non-political' (it was granted for services to the cinema) and he could have been a [[crossbencher]], Attenborough chose to take the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] whip and so sat on the Labour benches. In 1992 he had been offered a peerage by [[Neil Kinnock]], then leader of the Labour Party, but refused it as he felt unable to commit to the time necessary "to do what was required of him in the Upper Chamber, as he always put film-making first".<ref>''Entirely Up To You, Darling'' by Diana Hawkins & Richard Attenborough; pp 245–250; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009; ISBN 978-0-099-50304-0</ref>

In 1983, Attenborough was awarded the [[Padma Bhushan]], India's third highest civilian award, and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonviolence Peace Prize by the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/the-king-holiday/commemorative-service |title=Commemorative Services: Martin Luther King Jr. |publisher=Thekingcenter.org |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref>

In 1992 he was awarded the [[Shakespeare Prize]] for his life's work by the [[Alfred Toepfer Stiftung F.V.S.|Alfred Toepfer Foundation]] in Hamburg.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

On 13 July 2006, Attenborough, along with his brother [[David Attenborough|David]], were awarded the titles of [[Honorary title (academic)|Distinguished Honorary Fellows]] of the [[University of Leicester]] "in recognition of a record of continuing distinguished service to the university".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/ebulletin/news/press-releases/2000-2009/2006/06/nparticle.2006-06-09.8313843344 |title=Honorary Degrees and Distinguished Honorary Fellowships Announced by University of Leicester |publisher=www2.le.ac.uk |date=9 June 2006 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiaenews.com/2006-06/10872-leicester-varsity-honour-attenborough-brothers.htm |title=News from India |publisher=Indiaenews.com |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref>

On 20 November 2008, Attenborough was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Drama from the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] (RSAMD) in [[Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7710935.stm |title=Actors honoured by arts academy |publisher=BBC News |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>

[[Pinewood Studios]] paid tribute to his body of work by naming a purpose-built film and television stage after him. The Richard Attenborough Stage has an area of 30,000 sq ft. In his absence because of illness, [[David Puttnam|Lord Puttnam]] and Pinewood Chairman [[Michael Grade|Lord Grade]] officially unveiled the stage on 23 April 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pinewoodgroup.com/our-studios/uk/news/richard-attenborough-stage-opens-business-pinewood-studios |title=The Richard Attenborough Stage opens for business at Pinewood Studios |publisher=pinewoodgroup.com |date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref>

==Portrayals==
In early 1973 he was spoofed as "Dickie Attenborough" in the British Showbiz Awards sketch late in the third series of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]''. Attenborough is portrayed by [[Eric Idle]] as effusive and simpering.

In 2012 Attenborough was portrayed by [[Simon Callow]] in the [[BBC Four]] biopic ''The Best Possible Taste'' about [[Kenny Everett]].
