'''Karel Zeman''' (November 3, 1910 – April 5, 1989) was a Czech [[film director]], [[artist]], [[production designer]] and [[animator]], best known for directing fantasy films combining [[live-action]] footage with [[animation]].<ref name=Hames188>{{cite book|last=Hames|first=Peter|title=Czech and Slovak Cinema: Theme and Tradition|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|page=188}}</ref> Because of his creative use of special effects and animation in his films, he has often been called the "Czech [[Georges Méliès|Méliès]]."<ref name=Rochelle>{{cite web|last=Wellner-Pospisil|first=Michael|title=Le Méliès tchèque|url=http://www.festival-larochelle.org/festival-2002/karel-zeman|publisher=Festival International du Film de la Rochelle|accessdate=15 June 2013|language=French|year=2002}}</ref><ref name=Angers>{{cite web|title=Hommages et rétrospectives 2010: Karel Zeman|url=http://www.premiersplans.org/festival/2010/en/retrospectives-zeman.php|publisher=Angers European First Film Festival|accessdate=15 June 2013|year=2010}}</ref><ref name="Tout Ecran">{{cite web|title=Journée des enfants: Projection du film ''Sindbad'' de Karel Zeman|url=http://www.cinema-tout-ecran.ch/2002/prog/enfants.html|publisher=Cinéma Tout Écran|accessdate=15 June 2013|language=French|year=2002}}</ref>

==Life==
Zeman was born on November 3, 1910, in [[Ostroměř]] (near [[Nová Paka]]) in what was then [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref name=fabulousworld>{{cite journal|first=Markéta|last=Nováková|journal=Ahoy: Newsletter of the Czech Center New York|date=March–April 2001|title=The Fabulous World of Karel Zeman|volume=6|issue=2}} Published online: {{cite web|title=The Fabulous World of Karel Zeman|url=http://www.j-verne.de/verne_zeman_engl.html|work=Jules Verne: Andreas Fehrmann's Collection|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref> At his parents' insistence, he studied [[business education|business]] at high school in [[Kolín]].<ref name=MuseumBio>{{cite web|title=Biography: Karel Zeman|url=http://www.muzeumkarlazemana.cz/en/biography/biography|publisher=Muzeum Karla Zemana|accessdate=1 September 2013|year=2013}}</ref> In the 1920s, he studied at a French advertising school, and worked at an advertising studio in [[Marseilles]] until 1936.<ref name=Richter>{{cite web|last=Richter|first=Václav|title=Karel Zeman: le centenaire du magicien du cinéma tchèque|url=http://www.radio.cz/fr/rubrique/faits/karel-zeman-le-centenaire-du-magicien-du-cinema-tcheque|publisher=[[Radio Prague]]|accessdate=15 June 2013|language=French|date=20 May 2010}}</ref> It was in France that he first worked with animation, filming an ad for soap.<ref name=MuseumBio/> He then returned to his home country (by now the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]], known as [[Czechoslovakia]]), after visiting [[Egypt]], [[Yugoslavia]], and [[Greece]]. Back in Czechoslovakia, Zeman advertised for Czech firms like [[Bata Shoes|Baťa]] and [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]].<ref name=fabulousworld /> In 1939 he attempted to make an extended stay in [[Casablanca]], but was barred by the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] established by [[Nazi Germany]]; unable to get the necessary papers in time, Zeman was required to remain in his home country during the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=MuseumBio/>

At Baťa's window-dressing school, where he was teaching, Zeman met the animator [[Elmar Klos]] and showed him a sample of his work. Klos offered Zeman a job at [[Zlín]]'s animation studio. After some consideration (his wife and children were already established in [[Brno]]), Zeman accepted the job in 1943.<ref name=fabulousworld /> At the studio, Zeman worked as an assistant to the pioneering animator [[Hermína Týrlová]], and in 1945 he became the director of the [[stop-motion animation]] production group.<ref name=Hames196>Hames, p. 196</ref> The same year, in collaboration with his brother {{ill|cs|Bořivoj Zeman}}, he made his first short film, ''[[A Christmas Dream|Vánoční sen]]'' ("A Christmas Dream"). The short, which combined animated puppets with [[live-action]] footage, marked the beginning of Zeman's experiments with new techniques and genres.<ref name=Sadoul>{{cite book|last=Sadoul|first=Georges|title=Dictionary of Film Makers|year=1972|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520018648|page=286|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PvsZikRu-hAC&pg=PA286#v=onepage&q&f=false|authorlink=Georges Sadoul|accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref>

Zeman then went on to solo work, including a series of satirical cartoon shorts starring a puppet called [[Mr. Prokouk]]; the series was a wide success and the character became a Czech favorite.<ref name=TimesObit/> A bet Zeman accepted, challenging him to discover a method of working with glass in animation,<ref name=Sadoul/> led to the unusual short ''[[Inspirace]]'' ("Inspiration," 1948), which tells a wordless, poetic love story using animated glass figurines.<ref name=fabulousworld /> Zeman then went on to the half-hour film ''[[Král Lávra]]'' (1950), based on the satirical poem by [[Karel Havlíček Borovský]];<ref name=Hames196/> the film won a National Award.<ref name=fabulousworld /> In 1952, Zeman completed his first feature film, ''[[Poklad ptačího ostrova]]'' ("The Treasure of Bird Island," 1952). It was based on a Persian fairy tale and took its visual inspiration from Persian paintings,<ref name=Hames196/> combining multiple animation techniques in [[two-dimensional space|two-]] and [[three-dimensional space]].<ref name=Sadoul/>

[[File:Fabworldofjulesverne.jpg|thumb|American poster for Zeman's ''[[Vynález zkázy]]'']]
It was in 1955, however, that Zeman began the work for which he is most well-known: six feature films designed artistically to combine [[live-action]] and [[animation]] techniques.<ref name=Hames188/> These were:

*''[[Journey to the Beginning of Time|Cesta do pravěku]]'' (1955), inspired by [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' and the paintings of [[Zdeněk Burian]]
*''[[The Fabulous World of Jules Verne|Vynález zkázy]]'' (1958), based on Verne's ''[[Facing the Flag]]'', and filmed to emulate the original illustrations for Verne's novels
*''[[The Fabulous Baron Munchausen|Baron Prášil]]'' (1961), celebrating the legendary [[Baron Munchausen]] and the engravings of [[Gustave Doré]]
*''[[A Jester's Tale|Bláznova kronika]]'' (1964), a satire of the [[Thirty Years' War]], suggested by the drawings of [[Matthäus Merian]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Polt|first=Harriet|title=The Czechoslovak Animated Film|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1964|volume=17|issue=3|pages=38|jstor=1210908|doi=10.1525/fq.1964.17.3.04a00120}}</ref>
*''[[The Stolen Airship|Ukradená vzducholoď]]'' (1967), inspired by the Verne novels ''[[Two Years' Vacation]]'' and ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', the [[Art Nouveau]] style, and the [[General Land Centennial Exhibition (1891)|1891 Prague Centennial Exhibition]]
*''[[On the Comet|Na kometě]]'' (1970), an anti-war fantasy based on Verne's ''[[Hector Servadac]]''

He was a member of the jury at the [[2nd Moscow International Film Festival]] in 1961<ref name="Moscow1961">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |title=2nd Moscow International Film Festival (1961) |accessdate=2012-11-04 |publisher=[[Moscow International Film Festival]]}}</ref> and at the [[7th Moscow International Film Festival]] in 1971.<ref name="Moscow1971">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1971 |title=7th Moscow International Film Festival (1971) |accessdate=2012-12-22 |publisher=[[Moscow International Film Festival]]}}</ref> The Czechoslovakian government awarded him the title of National Artist in 1970.<ref name=TimesObit>{{cite news|title=Karel Zeman: Animated fantasy in the Czech cinema|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=10 April 1989|page=16}}</ref> 

After his live-action films, Zeman experimented with more classical forms of animation, beginning with seven shorts about [[Sinbad the Sailor]] which were then expanded into the feature film ''[[Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor|Pohádky tisíce a jedné noci]]'' (1974).<ref name="IMDb Sindbad">{{cite web|title=A Thousand and One Nights (1974) - Connections|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072004/trivia?tab=mc&ref_=tt_trv_cnn|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> His final films were ''[[Krabat – The Sorcerer's Apprentice|Čarodějův učeň]]'' (1977), from the novel ''[[The Satanic Mill]]'' by [[Otfried Preußler]], and ''[[Pohádka o Honzíkovi a Mařence]]'' (1980). On November 3, 1980, in celebration of Zeman's seventieth birthday, President [[Gustáv Husák]] awarded him the Order of the Republic.<ref name=FBIS-EEU/>

Zeman died in Gottwaldov (present-day [[Zlín]]) on April 5, 1989,<ref name=TimesObit/> a few months before the [[Velvet Revolution]].

==Legacy==
Zeman's works were influential to the Czech animator [[Jan Švankmajer]],<ref name="Harper & Stone">{{cite book|last1=Harper|first1=Graeme|last2=Stone|first2=Rob|title=The unsilvered screen: surrealism on film|year=2007|publisher=Wallflower Press|location=London|page=61|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wmM0INDGezgC&pg=PA61#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> as well as to the American filmmaker [[Terry Gilliam]],<ref name=Zipes>{{cite book|last=Zipes|first=Jack|title=The Enchanted Screen: The Unknown History of Fairy-Tale Films|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=43|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UKNaTwDWD_kC&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> who said of Zeman: "He did what I'm still trying to do, which is to try and combine live action with animation.

The film historian [[Georges Sadoul]] identified Zeman as having "widened the horizons of the eighth art, animation," adding:

{{bq|He is justly considered [[Méliès]]'s successor. He undoubtedly brings the old master to mind, not only because he is an artisan impassioned by art, creating his "innocent inventions" with infinite patience rather than with large budgets, but also because of his ingenuous and always ingenious fantasies. Less intellectual than [[Jiří Trnka|Trnka]], but nonetheless his equal, he has great zest and a marvelous sense of baroque oddities and poetic gags.<ref name=Sadoul/>}}

On the occasion of an animation exhibition in 2010, curators at the [[Barbican Centre]] said of Zeman: "although his influence outweighs his global fame, he is unarguably one of the greatest animators of all time."<ref name=Barbican/>

In 2012 a museum dedicated to Zeman and his work, the Muzeum Karla Zemana, opened near the [[Charles Bridge]] in Prague.<ref name=Velinger>{{cite web|last=Velinger|first=Jan|title=Visionary filmmaker Karel Zeman|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/special/the-work-of-visionary-filmmaker-karel-zeman-and-his-daughter-ludmila-acclaimed-childrens-book-author-illustrator|publisher=[[Radio Prague]]|accessdate=15 June 2013|date=26 December 2012}}</ref>
