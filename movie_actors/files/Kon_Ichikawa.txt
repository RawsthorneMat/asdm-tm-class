'''Kon Ichikawa''' {{nihongo|'''Kon Ichikawa'''|市川 崑|Ichikawa Kon|November 20, 1915 – February 13, 2008}} was a Japanese [[film director]].

==Early life and career==
Ichikawa was born in [[Ise, Mie]] Prefecture as Giichi Ichikawa (市川儀一).<ref name=filmbook>{{cite video|title=Ichikawa Kon Film Book| date=March 2012 |language=Japanese|publisher=Nihon Eiga Senmon Channeru}}</ref> His father died when he was four years old, and the family kimono shop went bankrupt, so he went to live with his sister.<ref name=filmbook/> He was given the name "Kon" by an uncle who thought the characters in the kanji 崑 signified good luck,  because the two halves of the Chinese character look the same when it is split in half vertically.<ref name=filmbook/> As a child he loved drawing and his ambition was to become an artist.<ref name=filmbook/> He also loved films and was a fan of "[[chambara]]" or samurai films.<ref name=filmbook/> In his teens he was fascinated by Walt Disney's "[[Silly Symphonies]]" and decided to become an animator.<ref name=filmbook/> He attended a technical school in [[Osaka]]. Upon graduation, in 1933, he found a job with a local rental film studio, [[J.O Studio]], in their animation department. Decades later, he told the American writer on Japanese film [[Donald Richie]], "I'm still a ''cartoonist'' and I think that the greatest influence on my films (besides [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]], particularly ''[[The Gold Rush]]'') is probably [[Walt Disney|Disney]]."<ref>[[Donald Richie|Richie, Donald]]. "The Several Sides of Kon Ichikawa". in Quandt (2001). p.53.</ref>

He moved to the feature film department as an assistant director when the company closed its animation department,<ref name=filmbook/> working under such luminaries as [[Yutaka Abe]] and [[Nobuo Aoyagi]].

In the early 1940s J.O Studio merged with P.C.L. and Toho Film Distribution to form the [[Toho|Toho Film Company]]. Ichikawa moved to Tokyo. His first film was a puppet play short, ''A Girl at Dojo Temple'' (''Musume Dojoji'' 1946), which was confiscated by the interim U.S. [[Occupied Japan|Occupation authorities]] under the pretense that it was too "feudal", though some sources suggest the script had not been approved by the occupying authorities. Thought lost for many years, it is now archived at the [[Cinémathèque Française]].

It was at Toho that he met Natto Wada. Wada was a translator for Toho. They agreed to marry sometime after Ichikawa completed his first film as director. Natto Wada's original name was Yumiko Mogi (born 13 September 1920 in [[Himeji, Hyōgo|Himeji]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], Japan); the couple both had failed marriages behind them. She graduated with a degree in English Literature from [[Tokyo Woman's Christian University]]. She married Kon Ichikawa on April 10, 1948, and died on February 18, 1983 of [[breast cancer]].<ref>James Quandt (ed.), ''Kon Ichikawa'', Cinematheque Ontario, Toronto, 2001, page 35.</ref>

==1950–1965==
It was after Ichikawa's marriage to Wada that the two began collaborating, first on ''Design of a Human Being'' (''Ningen moyo'') and ''Endless Passion'' (''Hateshinaki jonetsu'') in 1949. The period 1950–1965 is often referred to as Ichikawa's Natto Wada period. It's the period that contains the majority of Ichikawa's most highly respected works, such as [[Tokyo Olympiad]] (''Tōkyō Orinpikku''), and it is during this period that Wada wrote 34 screenplays, most of which were adaptations.

He gained western recognition during the 1950s and 1960s with two anti-war films, ''[[The Burmese Harp (film)|The Burmese Harp]]'' and ''[[Fires on the Plain (1959 film)|Fires on the Plain]]'', and the technically formidable period-piece ''[[An Actor's Revenge]]'' (''Yukinojo henge'') about a [[kabuki]] actor.

Among his many literary adaptations were [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]]'s ''The Key'' (''Kagi''), [[Natsume Sōseki]]'s ''The Heart'' (Kokoro) and ''I Am a Cat'' (''Wagahai wa neko de aru''), in which a teacher's cat critiques the foibles of the humans surrounding him, and [[Yukio Mishima]]'s ''Conflagration'' (''Enjo''), in which a priest burns down his temple to save it from spiritual pollution.

==After 1965==
After [[Tokyo Olympiad]], Wada retired from screenwriting and it marked a significant change in Ichikawa's films from that point onward. Concerning her retirement, he spoke, "She doesn't like the new film grammar, the method of presentation of the material; she says there's no heart in it anymore, that people no longer take human love seriously."<ref>James Quandt (ed.), ''Kon Ichikawa'', Cinematheque Ontario, Toronto, 2001, p40.</ref>

His final film, 2006's ''[[The Inugamis (2006 film)|The Inugamis]]'', a remake of Ichikawa's own 1976 film of the same name, was entered into the [[29th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name="Moscow2007">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2007 |title=29th Moscow International Film Festival (2007) |accessdate=2013-05-31 |work=MIFF}}</ref>

Also in 2006, Ichikawa was the subject of a feature-length documentary [[The Kon Ichikawa Story]], directed by [[Shunji Iwai]].

Ichikawa died of [[pneumonia]] on February 13, 2008 in a Tokyo hospital. He was 92 years old.<ref name = "Obit">{{cite web

''[[The Magic Hour (2008 film)|The Magic Hour]]'' marked Ichikawa's last appearance and was dedicated to his memory. (This message can be seen in the end of this film.) In this film, a movie director played by Ichikawa is shooting ''Kuroi Hyaku-ichi-nin no Onna'' (a hundred and one dark women), a parody of ''[[Ten Dark Women]]''.

==Legacy==
Ichikawa's films are marked with a certain darkness and bleakness, punctuated with sparks of humanity.

It can be said that his main trait is technical expertise, irony, detachment and a drive for realism married with a complete spectrum of genres. Some critics class him with [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]] and [[Yasujirō Ozu]] as one of the masters of Japanese cinema.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}
