'''Samuel M<!-- His middle name is just the letter "M". It is not "Marshall" --> "Sam" Raimi'''<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/24709/sam-raimi-interview-oz-warcraft-spider-man-the-shadow Sometimes erroneously referred to as Samuel Marshall Raimi]</ref> (born October 23, 1959) is an American film director, producer, writer and actor, famous for creating the cult horror comedy [[The Evil Dead (franchise)|''Evil Dead'' series]], as well as directing the superhero film ''[[Darkman]]'', and the original [[Spider-Man trilogy|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]] (2002-2007); his most recent work is 2013's fantasy film ''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]''. Raimi has produced several successful television series and is the founder of [[Renaissance Pictures]]. Recently, he worked as the producer of ''[[The Possession]]'', and the [[Evil Dead (2013 film)|2013 remake of ''Evil Dead'']]. He is currently working on a film adaption of the critically acclaimed video game ''[[The Last of Us]]''.

He is the older brother of actor [[Ted Raimi]] and the younger brother of screenwriter [[Ivan Raimi]].

==Early life==
Raimi, the fourth of five children, was born in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], the son of Celia Barbara (Abrams) and Leonard Ronald Raimi, and grew up in [[Birmingham, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/52/Sam-Raimi.html |title=Sam Raimi Biography (2006–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/23/Ted-Raimi.html |title=Ted Raimi Biography (1965–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}</ref> He was raised in [[Conservative Judaism]]; his ancestors emigrated from Russia and Hungary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=8479 |title=JewishJournal.com |publisher=JewishJournal.com |date= |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/the_ticket/item/sam_raimis_latest_horror_flick_draws_on_true_tale_jewish_exorcism_20120822 |title=Sam Raimi's latest horror flick draws on 'true' tale, Jewish exorcism |publisher=Jewishjournal.com |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}</ref> Raimi graduated from [[Groves High School (Michigan)|Groves High School]]<ref name=macomb>{{cite web | url = http://shelby-utica.patch.com/articles/macomb-co-native-helps-organize-charity-premiere-of-oz-the-great-and-powerful | title = Macomb Co.

==Film==
Raimi became fascinated with making films when his father brought a movie camera home one day and he began to make [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] movies with childhood friend [[Bruce Campbell]]. In college, he teamed up with his brother's roommate [[Robert Tapert]] and Campbell to shoot ''[[Within the Woods]]'' (1978), a 32-minute horror film which raised $375,000, as well as the short comedic film ''[[It's Murder!]]''  Through family, friends, and a network of investors Raimi was able to finance production of the highly successful [[horror film]] ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981) which became a cult hit and effectively launched Raimi's career. He began work on his second film ''[[Crimewave]]'' (1985), intended as a live-action comic book—the film was not successful, due in part to unwanted studio intervention. Raimi returned to the horror genre with the seminal ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' (which added [[slapstick]] humor to the over the top horror, showcasing his love of the [[Three Stooges]]). With his brother [[Ivan Raimi]] (and crediting himself as Celia Abrams), Sam Raimi also wrote ''[[Easy Wheels]]'' (1989), a parody of the [[Outlaw biker film]] genre. A long-time comic book buff, he then attempted to adapt "[[The Shadow]]" into a movie, but was unable to secure the rights, so he created his own super-hero, ''[[Darkman]]'' (1990). The film was his first major studio picture, and was only moderately successful, but through it he was still able to secure funding for ''Evil Dead III'', which was retitled ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' and turned away almost totally from horror in favor of [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] and [[Comedy film|comedy]] elements. ''Army of Darkness'', the final movie in the ''Evil Dead'' trilogy, was a box office flop, yet on video became a cult classic.

In the 1990s, Raimi moved into other genres, directing such films as the western ''[[The Quick and the Dead (1995 film)|The Quick and the Dead]]'' (starring [[Sharon Stone]] and [[Gene Hackman]]), the critically acclaimed crime thriller ''[[A Simple Plan (film)|A Simple Plan]]'' (1998) (starring [[Bill Paxton]] and [[Billy Bob Thornton]]), and the romantic drama ''[[For Love of the Game (film)|For Love of the Game]]'' (1999) (starring [[Kevin Costner]]). Raimi achieved great critical and commercial success with the [[blockbuster motion picture|blockbuster]] ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002), which was adapted from the comic book series [[Spider-Man|of the same name]]. The movie has grossed over US$800 million worldwide, spawning two sequels: ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', both directed by Raimi and both grossing roughly $800 million each. After the completion of the third Spider-Man film, he planned on producing two more sequels but could not find a satisfactory script. Prior to directing the Spider-Man films, Raimi lobbied to direct ''[[Batman Forever]]'' when [[Tim Burton]] was ousted from the director's chair, but was rejected in favor of [[Joel Schumacher]], whose reputation at the time outshone Raimi's.

Raimi frequently collaborates with [[Coen brothers|Joel and Ethan Coen]], beginning when Joel was one of the editors of ''Evil Dead''.  The Coens co-wrote ''Crimewave'' and ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]'' with Raimi in the mid-1980s (though ''Hudsucker'' was not produced for almost a decade).  Raimi made cameo appearances in ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'', ''The Hudsucker Proxy'', and with Joel Coen in ''[[Spies Like Us]]''.  The Coen brothers gave Raimi advice on shooting in snow for ''A Simple Plan'', based on their experiences with ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]''. He has also worked in front of the camera in ''[[The Stand (TV miniseries)|The Stand]]'' as a dimwitted hitman, [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Body Bags (film)|Body Bags]]'' as a gas station attendant, and ''[[Indian Summer (1993 film)|Indian Summer]]'' in what is perhaps his biggest role as a bumbling assistant to [[Alan Arkin]]. The film was written by his childhood friend writer-director Mike Binder and shot at the camp that they both attended when they were younger. Raimi also produced the entire [[The Grudge (franchise)|''The Grudge'' franchise]]. According to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Raimi had expressed an interest in directing a film version of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the prequel to the ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035161,00.html|title='Hobbit' Forming?|first=Adam |last=Markovitz | work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 18, 2007}}</ref> In 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro]] was selected as the director, with [[Peter Jackson]] as the executive producer. Raimi may direct ''By Any Means Necessary'', the next film based on the "Jack Ryan" CIA character created by [[Tom Clancy]] for [[Paramount Pictures]]. Disney also approached him to direct ''[[W.I.T.C.H.]]: The Movie'', based on the popular comic.

Blizzard Entertainment announced on July 22, 2009 that Sam Raimi will be directing a ''[[Warcraft]]'' film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blizzard.com/us/press/090721.html|title=Blizzard Press Release 7-22-2009|publisher=Blizzard|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref> However at [[Comic-Con International]] 2012, it was revealed that he would not be the one directing the [[World of Warcraft]] adaptation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Topel|first=Fred|title=Comic Con 2012 Exclusive: Sam Raimi Won't Direct the World of Warcraft Movie|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/articles/192085-comic-con-2012-exclusive-sam-raimi-wont-direct-the-world-of-warcraft-movie|publisher=Crave Online|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}</ref>

On December 11, 2006, the website SuperHero Hype reported that director Sam Raimi and Michael Uslan would co-produce a new film version of ''[[The Shadow]]'' for Columbia Pictures. On October 16, 2007, Raimi stated that: "I don't have any news on 'The Shadow' at this time, except that the company that I have with Josh Donen, my producing partner, we've got the rights to 'The Shadow.' I love the character very much and we're trying to work on a story that'll do justice to the character." On January 29, 2010, it was reported that Sam Raimi was searching for a new project after it was announced that the Spider-Man movie franchise would be rebooted without him. The Shadow was said to be at the top of his list. On Thursday, August 5, 2010, it was reported that [[Quentin Tarantino]] – who was attached as a co-writer for the script – was attached to direct as well. However, Tarantino denied this rumor, reportedly saying "That's totally made up."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/12/02/quentin-tarantino-the-shadow/|title=Quentin Tarantino Says 'The Shadow' Rumors Are 'Totally Made Up'}}</ref>

Raimi, along with [[Bruce Campbell]] and [[Rob Tapert]], produced the remake of Raimi's ''The Evil Dead''.

==Television==
In addition to film, Raimi has worked in television, producing such series as ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'' and its [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', both featuring his younger brother [[Ted Raimi]] and long-time friend Bruce Campbell, ''[[American Gothic (TV series)|American Gothic]]'', ''[[Cleopatra 2525]]'', ''[[M.A.N.T.I.S.]]'', ''[[13: Fear Is Real]]'', ''[[Young Hercules]]'', and ''[[Jack of All Trades (TV series)|Jack of All Trades]]''.  In 2008 Raimi executive produced a syndicated TV series called ''[[Legend of the Seeker]]'', based on [[Terry Goodkind]]'s best-selling ''[[The Sword of Truth]]'' fantasy series. He is also the executive producer of [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] original television series ''[[Spartacus: Blood and Sand]]'' and ''[[Spartacus: Gods of the Arena]]'',<ref>{{cite web |title = "Spartacus: Blood and Sand" cast and crew |url = http://www.starz.com/originals/spartacus/cast | accessdate = January 30, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Spartacus: Vengeance]]'' and ''[[Spartacus: War of the Damned]]''.

==Recurring trademarks, motifs, and partners==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2014}}
Raimi's brother Ted Raimi and his friend Bruce Campbell often appear in on-screen roles in his film and television projects, although some of the appearances are just [[Cameo role|cameos]]. The trio have been working together since their college days.  Both Ted and Bruce have appeared in all three ''Evil Dead'' and ''Spider-Man'' movies, as well as ''[[Hercules: the Legendary Journeys]]'' and ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', which Sam produced. In the ''Evil Dead'' films, Campbell plays the recurring lead part of [[Ash Williams|Ash]], while Ted played various small parts in each film.

In the ''Spider-Man'' films Ted played the featured role of ''Daily Bugle'' advertising manager Ted Hoffman, while Bruce Campbell played different roles in each ''Spider-Man'' film. In ''Hercules'' and ''Xena'', Ted and Bruce played the recurring roles of Joxer and Autolycus respectively. Raimi occasionally appears on-screen in his movies, usually in similar fashion to the cameos made by his idol [[Alfred Hitchcock]]:  In ''Spider-Man'' in the wrestling scene as a silhouette behind a projection screen; in ''Spider-Man 2'' as a passing student whose bookbag hits Peter Parker in the back of the head; as a hitchhiking fisherman accompanied by Robert Tapert in ''The Evil Dead''.  Raimi also wears a suit with white shirt and tie on-set in another homage to Hitchcock. An adept fan will also notice Raimi's recurring usage of soda crackers as a back prop.

Raimi often works with film editor [[Bob Murawski]], a fellow Michigan State University alumnus. Among Raimi's films edited by Murawski include the ''Spider-Man'' movies, ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'', and ''Army of Darkness''. Raimi also frequently collaborates with composer [[Joseph LoDuca]], another acquaintance from Michigan who has provided the scores to most of his films.

Raimi has included his old car from his college days, a 1973 yellow [[Oldsmobile]] [[Oldsmobile 88|Delta 88]] automobile (nicknamed "The Classic"), in every film including ''[[The Quick and the Dead (1995 film)|The Quick and the Dead]]'' ("Somewhere...somewhere hidden.  Only I know.  I'll never tell").  At Comic-con 2005 Bruce Campbell revealed that a special covered wagon frame had covered the Oldsmobile to maintain the motif of the film. The yellow Oldsmobile also appeared in ''Drag Me to Hell,'' driven by the elderly gypsy woman.  A bottle of [[Maker's Mark]] also appears regularly in his movies.  The Classic does not appear in the final cut of [[For Love of the Game (film)|For Love of the Game]], however.  The scene in which it appeared was removed during the editing process.

Other Raimi visual trademarks include:

* A distinctive camera shot where the camera follows a moving object (such as an arrow or a bullet) at high speed creating a first-person point-of-view from the object itself;
* A rapid [[Tracking shot|dolly shot]] to bring a far-off object suddenly into the center of the frame or to pull back from the main focal object to show what is happening around the perimeter (sometimes called "push-pull");
* [[Montage sequence]]s with overlapping close-up shots to establish a set of similar actions over elapsing time.
* Extreme closeups using a wide angle lens.

In the ''Making The Amazing'' documentary on the ''Spider-Man 2'' DVD, both [[Tobey Maguire]] and Bruce Campbell humorously describe Raimi's penchant for "abusing" actors. To obtain detailed closeups of a character getting hit by debris Raimi stands off-camera throwing items, swinging tree branches, etc., at the actor at the center of the shot.  Scenes from the documentary show that Raimi is the one throwing popcorn at Peter Parker during the walk to the wrestling ring in ''Spider-Man'' and tossing gold coins around during the bank robbery scene in ''Spider-Man 2''.

In many of Raimi's movies the camera itself is part of the action onscreen. One of Raimi's most famous sequences involves a point-of-view shot of actor Bruce Campbell being chased through a cabin by an unseen evil force.

==Personal life==
Raimi has been married since 1993 to Gillian Dania Greene, daughter of actor [[Lorne Greene]]. They have five children, three of whom (daughter Emma Rose and sons Lorne and Henry) appeared as extras in ''Drag Me to Hell'', and in ''Spider-Man 3'' during the movie's final battle.

In 2007, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reported Raimi had donated $9,999 to the Republican Party (the maximum legal amount allowed for individuals and groups).
