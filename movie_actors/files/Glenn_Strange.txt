'''Glenn Strange''' (August 16, 1899 &ndash; September 20, 1973) was an American actor who mostly appeared in [[western (genre)|Western]] [[film]]s. He is best remembered for playing [[Frankenstein's monster]] in three [[Universal Studios|Universal]] [[film]]s during the 1940s and for his role as Sam Noonan, the popular [[bartender]] on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' [[television series]]. Strange was of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Cherokee Nation|Cherokee]] descent and was a cousin of the Western film star and [[narrator]] [[Rex Allen]].

==Life and career==
Strange was born near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]] in tiny [[Weed, New Mexico|Weed]] in [[Otero County, New Mexico|Otero County]], northeast of [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], some thirteen years prior to [[New Mexico]] gaining statehood. He was born as '''George Glenn Strange''', the fourth child of William Russell Strange and the former Sarah Eliza Byrd. He was an eighth generation grandson of [[Pocahontas]] and [[John Rolfe]] of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]].

Strange grew up in tiny Cross Cut (formerly known as Cross Out) in [[Brown County, Texas|Brown County]] (county seat: [[Brownwood, Texas|Brownwood]]), some fifty miles east of [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] in [[West Texas]]. His father was a bartender and later a [[ranch]]er. Strange learned by ear how to play the [[fiddle]] and [[guitar]]. By the time he was twelve, young Glenn was performing at [[cowboy]] [[dance]]s. By 1928, he was on [[radio]] in El Paso. He was a young rancher, but in 1930, he came to [[Hollywood]] as a member of the radio singing group, [[radio|Arizona Wranglers]]. Strange joined the singers after having appeared at a [[rodeo]] in [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] in [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai County]] in central [[Arizona]]. Another Strange cousin, Taylor McPeters, or "Cactus Mack" was also part of the Wranglers. Strange's Arizona connection prevailed when he guest starred in the 1958 episode "Chain Gang" of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] western series ''[[26 Men]]'', true stories about the ''[[Arizona Rangers]]''.  In 1932, Strange had a minor role as part of the Wrecker's gang in a 12-part serial, ''[[The Hurricane Express]]'', starring [[John Wayne]].

Strange procured his first motion picture role in 1932 and appeared in hundreds of films during his lifetime. Beginning in 1949, he portrayed Butch Cavendish, the "bad guy" responsible for killing all of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], that is except one, in the long-running television series ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]''.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), p. 103</ref>

Strange appeared twice as Jim Wade on [[Bill Williams (actor)|Bill Williams]]'s  syndicated western series geared to juvenile audience's ''[[The Adventures of Kit Carson]]''. He also appeared twice as 'Blake' in the syndicated western ''[[The Cisco Kid (TV series)|The Cisco Kid]]''. In 1952, he was cast in the role of Chief Black Cloud in the episode "Indian War Party" of the syndicated ''[[The Range Rider]]'', starring [[Jock Mahoney]] and [[Dick Jones (actor)|Dick Jones]]. In 1954, Strange played Sheriff Billy Rowland in [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]]'s syndicated western series ''[[Stories of the Century]]''. Strange appeared six times in 1956 in multiple roles on [[Edgar Buchanan]]'s syndicated ''[[Judge Roy Bean (TV series)|Judge Roy Bean]]''. In 1958, he had a minor part in an episode of [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]]'s ''[[The Restless Gun]]''. That same year he played the rancher Pat Cafferty, who faces the threat of [[anthrax]], in the episode "Queen of the Cimarron" of the syndicated western series, ''[[Frontier Doctor]]'', starring his cousin [[Rex Allen]].

Strange was cast in five episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] western, ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', with [[Hugh O'Brian]], and in three segments of the syndicated ''[[Annie Oakley (TV series)|Annie Oakley]]'', starring [[Gail Davis]] and [[Brad Johnson (television actor)|Brad Johnson]]. In 1959, he appeared in another western syndicated series, ''[[Mackenzie's Raiders]]'', in the episode entitled "Apache Boy". Strange first appeared on ''Gunsmoke'' in 1959 and assumed several roles on the long-running program before he was permanently cast as the stolid bartender.

Strange was cast twice on [[Kirby Grant]]'s western aviation adventure series, ''[[Sky King]]'', as Rip Owen in "Stage Coach Robbers" (1952) and as Link in "Dead Giveaway" (1958)

== Frankenstein's Monster ==

In 1942, he appeared in ''[[The Mad Monster]]'' for [[Producers Releasing Corporation|PRC]], a poverty row studio. In 1944, while Strange was being made up for an action film at Universal, make-up artist [[Jack Pierce]] noticed that Strange's facial features and 6'5" height would be appropriate for the role of [[Frankenstein's Monster|Frankenstein's monster]]. Strange was cast in ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' in the role created by [[Boris Karloff]] in ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1931), coached by Karloff personally after hours together.
 
Strange recounted a personal anecdote in [[Ted Newsom]]'s [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''[[100 Years of Horror]]'' (1996). On the set of ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945), [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], got him extremely inebriated. In the scene in which the Monster is discovered in a cave, where Strange lay immersed for hours in "faked quicksand" (actually cold mud) waiting for the cameras to roll. As Glenn began to get a serious chill, Chaney recommended that alcohol would keep Strange warm. Strange could barely walk straight after the day's shooting.

Strange played the Monster a third time in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948), with Chaney, Jr. as the [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|Wolf Man]] and [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]]. Strange also appeared in character with [[Lou Costello]] in a haunted house skit on ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' as well as making a gag publicity appearance as a masked [[Pole-sitting|flagpole-sitter]] for a local Los Angeles TV show in the 1950s. After weeks of the station teasing the public about the sitter's identity, Strange removed his mask and revealed himself as Frankenstein's monster (actually, yet another mask.) Strange also played a monster in the [[The Bowery Boys|Bowery Boys]] horror-comedy ''Master Minds'' in 1949, mimicking the brain-transplanted [[Huntz Hall]]'s frantic comedy movements, with Hall providing his own dubbed voice.

During the wave of monster-related merchandising in the late 1950s and 1960s, it was usually Glenn Strange's iconic image used for the Monster on toys, games and paraphernalia, most often from his appearance in the Abbott & Costello film. In 1969, ''[[The New York Times]]'' mistakenly published Boris Karloff's obituary with Glenn Strange's picture as the Frankenstein monster.<ref>Gregory William Mank, ''Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff: The Expanded Story of a Haunting Collaboration'', McFarland & Co Inc, 2009, ISBN 0-7864-3480-5, page 610</ref>

==Physical and family information==

Strange was 6 feet, 5&nbsp;inches tall and weighed 220 pounds. His first wife was the former Flora Hooper of [[Duncan, Oklahoma|Duncan]], [[Oklahoma]]. They had two daughters, Wynema and Juanita. He was married from 1937 to his death in 1973 to his third wife, the former Minnie Thompson (1911â€“2004). The couple had two children, Harry Glenn Strange (born 1938) of [[Klamath Falls, Oregon|Klamath Falls]], [[Oregon]] and Janine Laraine Strange (born 1939).

==Death==

Strange died of [[lung cancer]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], just after declining health had compelled him to leave his role on ''Gunsmoke''. Strange had from time to time collaborated on various tunes with western actor [[Eddie Dean (singer)|Eddie Dean]], including the opening title song for Dean's ''Tumbleweed Trail'' (1942). Dean sang at Strange's funeral service as a final tribute. Strange is interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery]].

In 1975, two years after Strange's death, his ''Gunsmoke'' costar [[Buck Taylor]] named his third son Cooper Glenn Taylor after his friend Glenn Strange.
