==Career==
After completing his training as an actor, Isaacs almost immediately began appearing on the stage and on television; his film debut was in a minor role as a doctor in [[Mel Smith]]'s ''[[The Tall Guy]]'' (1989).<ref name=Yahoo/> He was initially known as a TV actor in the UK, with starring roles in the ITV drama ''[[Capital City (show)|Capital City]]'' (1989) and the BBC drama ''Civvies'' (1992) and guest roles in series such as ''[[Taggart]]'', ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'', and ''[[Highlander: The Series]]'' (1993).<ref name=Yahoo/> He also played Michael Ryan in ITV1's adaptation of [[Martina Cole]]'s novel ''[[Dangerous Lady (TV Series)|Dangerous Lady]]'', directed by Jack Woods and produced by [[Lavinia Warner]], in 1995.

On stage he portrayed the "emotionally waffling"<ref name=Yahoo/> gay Jewish office temp Louis Ironson in Tony Kushner's Pulitzer-Prize-winning ''[[Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes]]'', at the [[Royal National Theatre]], in its London première, performing the role in both parts, ''Part One: Millennium Approaches'', in 1992, and ''Part Two: Perestroika'', in 1993.<ref name=NTArchive/>  When auditioning for that role, he told the producers, "Look, I play all these tough guys and thugs and strong, complex characters. In real life, I am a cringing, neurotic Jewish mess. Can't I for once play that on stage?"<ref name=Pfefferman2/>

His first Hollywood role was alongside [[Laurence Fishburne]] in the film ''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]'' in 1997, in which he played a crew member ultimately killed by the protagonist-turned-antagonist acted by [[Sam Neill]]. Subsequently, he appeared in the [[Bruce Willis]] blockbuster ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' (1998).<ref name=Yahoo/> Initially called upon to take a fairly substantial role, Isaacs was eventually cast in a much smaller capacity as a planet-saving scientist so that he could accommodate his commitment to ''[[Divorcing Jack (film)|Divorcing Jack]]'' (1998), a comedy thriller he was making with [[David Thewlis]].<ref name=Marx/>

After portraying a priest opposite [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Ralph Fiennes]] in [[Neil Jordan]]'s acclaimed adaptation of [[Graham Greene]]'s ''[[The End of the Affair (1999 film)|The End of the Affair]]'' (1999), Isaacs played the charismatic honourable priest opposite [[Kirsty Alley]] in the mini series ''[[The Last Don]]''. He then shone as "memorable" villain, Colonel William Tavington, in Roland Emmerich's [[American Revolutionary War]] fictional film epic ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'' (2000).<ref name=Yahoo/> Starring opposite [[Mel Gibson]] as the film's hero, and [[Heath Ledger]] as Gibson's screen son, Isaacs portrays a sadistic [[British Army]] officer who kills Ledger's character, among many other soldiers.<ref name=Yahoo/><ref name=Mitovich>{{Cite news|author=Matt Webb Mitovich|title=Interviews & Features: Jason Isaacs: More Than a Bad Brother|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News-Views/Interviews-Features/Article/default.aspx?posting=%7B4C8BB519-4955-469B-BFAA-4F92B24C3768%7D|archiveurl=http://www.jasonisaacsphotoalbumsonline.com/TV/Brotherhood/7_20_2006%20TVGuideInsider.htm|archivedate=20 October 2008|work=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=TVGuide.com|date=21 July 2006|accessdate=24 June 2008}}</ref> Although his work in the film earned him comparisons to [[Ralph Fiennes]]' portrayal of Nazi [[Amon Göth]] in ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993) and mention of a Best Supporting Actor [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination, reaching beyond being typecast as an historical villain, Isaacs chose to play a [[drag queen]] in his next project, ''[[Sweet November (2001 film)|Sweet November]]'' (2001), a romantic comedy-drama starring [[Charlize Theron]] and [[Keanu Reeves]].<ref name=Marx/>

Isaacs has appeared in many other films, most notably as [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] in the ''[[Harry Potter film series|Harry Potter]]'' series of films (2002–2011). Regarding the Harry Potter books by [[J.K. Rowling]], Isaacs has said: "I went off and read the books after the audition and I read the first four books in one sitting – you know – didn't wash, didn't eat, drove around with them on the steering wheel like a lunatic. I suddenly understood why my friends, who I'd thought were slightly backward, had been so addicted to these children's books. They're like [[Crack cocaine|crack]]."{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In "The Naked and the Dead", an article published in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', on 26 November 2006, Neva Chonin names the character Lucius Malfoy one of the 12 "Sexiest Men Who Were Never Alive" and Isaacs one of the 13 "Sexiest Men Who Are Real and Alive".<ref>{{cite news|author=Neva Chonin|title=The Naked and the Dead|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/11/26/PKGMQKFMGP1.DTL|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=26 November 2006|accessdate=29 June 2008}}</ref>

Prior to the making of the film, when asked whether or not he would be in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'' (2007), Isaacs replied, "I hope so – you'll have to ask David (producer [[David Heyman]]). I can't bear the idea that somebody else would get to wear my [[Paris Hilton]] wig, but you never know."<ref name=Empire>{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Order of the Phoenix News: The Cast Talk Harry Potter 5|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=18268 |work=Empire |date=15 March 2006|accessdate=23 June 2008}}</ref> Isaacs also talked to J.K. Rowling on the inclusion of Lucius Malfoy in the then unpublished ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', so that he would have a part in the seventh and final film: "The character does not appear in the sixth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''; but ... [Isaacs joked], 'I fell to my knees and begged ... It didn't do any good. I'm sure she doesn't need plot ideas from me. But I made my point. We'll see. Like everybody else, I'm holding my breath to July to see what's in there. I just want to bust out of prison, that's all.

Afterwards, Isaacs reprised the role again in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1]]'' (2010) and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2|Part 2]]'' (2011).<ref name=Huver>{{cite news|author=Scott Huver|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46320|title=Isaacs Conjures Lucius Malfoy's Return to Harry Potter|work=CraveOnline:Film & TV|publisher=ComingSoon.net''|date=25 June 2008|accessdate=4 July 2008}}</ref>

He provided the voice of [[Ra's al Ghul]] in the 2010 DC animated film, ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'' and also the voice of [[Sinestro]] in the 2011 DC animated film ''[[Green Lantern: Emerald Knights]]''.

Isaacs starred as Detective Michael Britten in the NBC series ''[[Awake (TV series)|Awake]]'', which premiered on 1 March 2012, and ended in May 2012. After Britten gets into a terrible car wreck with his family, his dreams begin to take on two alternate realities, one in which his wife died in the crash and one in which his son died. Says Isaacs about the ambitious premise: “There’s no question it's challenging. We’ve got a bunch of very experienced writers who have written things from HBO shows to ''[[The X-Files]]'', to ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' and everything in between. And they are challenged. All of them have said that it's the hardest job that they've ever had. But sometimes that's a good thing. … If it comes easily, that they could write in their sleep, I personally wouldn't want to act – and I think the audience wouldn't want to watch."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2012/02/24/jason-isaacs-new-nbc-series-awake/ |title=Jason Isaacs on his new NBC series, "Awake" |publisher=channelguidemag.com |accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref>

In February 2014, the [[USA Network]] announced Isaacs has been cast in its upcoming action adventure drama series, ''[[Dig (TV series)|Dig]]''. Isaacs portrays an FBI agent in Jerusalem who uncovers a 2,000-year-old conspiracy while investigating an archaeologist's murder. The six-episode series premiered March 5th, 2015.<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/02/14/jason-isaacs-to-star-in-usa-network-international-thriller-dig/237250/ Jason Isaacs to Star in USA Network International Thriller 'Dig']</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:Jason at golf.jpg|thumb|Isaacs at the Monday After the Masters Celebrity Pro-Am Golf Tournament on 11 April 2005]]
Isaacs has lived with his partner [[BBC]] documentary filmmaker Emma Hewitt since 1988. The couple began dating at the Central School, and have two daughters, Lilly and Ruby.<ref name=Lester2>{{cite news|author=Paul Lester|title=JC Interview: Jason Isaacs|url=http://www.thejc.com/home.aspx?ParentId=m12s28&SecId=28&AId=57814&ATypeId=1|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080204152349/http://www.thejc.com/home.aspx?ParentId=m12s28&SecId=28&AId=57814&ATypeId=1|archivedate=4 February 2008|work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]]|date=1 February 2008|accessdate=23 June 2008|quote=Luckily, Isaacs gets to relax at home in North-West London with Emma Hewitt, his partner of 20 years (to whom he invariably refers as “my wife”), and his two young daughters, Lilly and Ruby.}}</ref>

Despite Isaacs' screen celebrity as [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]], he maintains a relatively modest, "calm, sedate and suburban" life,<ref name=Lester2/><ref name=videointerv>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelondonpaper.com/cs/Satellite/london/videos/article/1157140705031?packedargs=suffix%3DSubSectionArticle|title=Jason Isaacs Video Interview|work=[[The London Paper]]|publisher=thelondonpaper.com|accessdate=27 June 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013145641/http://thelondonpaper.com/cs/Satellite/london/videos/article/1157140705031?packedargs=suffix%3dSubSectionArticle |archivedate = 13 October 2007 }}</ref> which he prefers to the "hideously compromised lives" of the more rich and famous: "I imagine like most of us that I'd like obscene amounts of money but the people I met and worked with who have those obscene amounts of money and have obscene amounts of fame have awful lives. Really. I mean hideously compromised lives...."  Described as an "invisible star" who can still travel by the [[London Underground]] to film premières unrecognised, he has observed: "They just think, who's that <nowiki>t***</nowiki><!--Do not replace the "***" - this is how it was indicated in the article cited.--> in black tie? As soon as I get on the red carpet they start screaming and screaming. ... It's laughable because when it's all over I go home on the Tube as well."<ref name=Rees4>{{cite news|author=Jasper Rees|title='There is a streak of cruelty in me': Actor Jason Isaacs Says Life Prepared Him to Become a Specialist in Unattractive Characters|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]], Review|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20081207142331/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/01/27/baisaacs127.xml|date=27 January 2007|accessdate=18 March 2012}}</ref>

As a [[secular Jew|non-religious Jew]], Isaacs has semi-jokingly called himself a "Jewish man who does almost nothing Jewish in his life".<ref name=era>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1057156.html Jewish World / Voldemort's sidekick turns Jewish psychiatrist in film on Nazi era]. ''Haaretz''. Published 21 January 2009.</ref>

Isaacs is a firm, though not uncritical supporter of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] declaring, in April 2009: "I am huge New Labour supporter. They've done amazing things in terms of real money put into education, health service and childcare. But they've also, on this watch, done away with the right to silence, and been party to an invasion of a country based on false pretexts. They, and most of the West, have done away with the [[Geneva Convention]]... all these things have happened on my watch, but I've done absolutely nothing about it other than try to sound righteous."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/bad-boy-does-good-jason-isaacs-new-project-is-all-heart-1666086.html |newspaper=The Independent |title=Bad boy does good: Jason Isaacs' new project is all heart |date=9 April 2009}}</ref>
