Among her best known films are  ''[[Mississippi Masala]]'', ''[[Monsoon Wedding]]'', and ''[[The Namesake (film)|The Namesake]]''.

==Early life and education==
Mira Nair was born on October 25, 1957 in [[Rourkela]], Odisha, and grew up with her two older two brothers and parents in [[Bhubaneshwar]], Odisha. Along with the rest of her family, Nair is [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]], and is from one of the most prosperous, middle-upper-class, regions located in India.<ref name="Applause Theater & Cinema Books">{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John Kenneth|title=Mercy In Her Eyes: The Films of Mira Nair|date=June 1, 2006|publisher=Applause Theater & Cinema Books|isbn=1557836493|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref> Her father, Amrit Nair, is an Indian administrative officer, and her mother, Praveen Nair, is a social worker who often worked with illiterate children.<ref name="Mira Nair">{{cite web|title=Mira Nair|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2007-Li-Pr/Nair-Mira.html|website=Encyclopedia of World Biography|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref> At the age of eleven, Nair and her family moved to Delhi due to her father transferring posts. By thirteen she left home to attend Tara Hall, an Irish-Catholic missionary school located in Simla, where she grew an infatuation with English literature. Following Tara Hall, Nair went on to study at Miranda House at [[Delhi University]], where she majored in [[Sociology]]. In order to gain the best education available, Nair applied to Western schools and at nineteen she was offered a full scholarship to [[Cambridge University]], but ultimately turned it down and instead accepted a full scholarship to [[Harvard University]].<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu">{{cite web|last1=Blenski|first1=Simon|last2=Debreyne|first2=Adrien Maurice|last3=Hegewisch|first3=Martha Eugina|last4=Trivedi|first4=Avani Anant|title=Mira Nair|url=http://voices.cla.umn.edu/artistpages/nairMira.php|website=University of Minnesota|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>

==Career==

===Documentaries===

Before she became a filmmaker, Nair was originally interesting in acting, and at one point she performed plays written by [Badal Sarkar], a [Bengali] performer. While she studied at Harvard University, Nair became involved in the theater program and won a Boylston Prize for her performance of Jocasta’s speech from Seneca’s [[Oedipus]].<ref name="Applause Theater & Cinema Books"/> She soon became disillusioned by the Harvard theater program and turned to film-making.

At the start of her film-making career, Nair primarily documentaries in which she explored Indian cultural tradition. For her film thesis at Harvard between 1978 and 1979, Nair produced a black-and-white film entitled ''Jama Masjid Street Journal''. In the eighteen minute film, Nair explores the streets of [[Old Delhi]] and has casual conversations with Indian locals.<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu"/>

In 1982, she made her second documentary entitled ''So Far from India'', which is a fifty-two minute film that followed an Indian newspaper dealer living in the subways of New York, while his pregnant wife waited for him to return home.<ref name="Mira Nair"/> This is considered to be Nair’s first “professional film,” and was even recognized as a Best Documentary winner at the [[American Film Festival]] and New York’s Global Village Film Festival.<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu"/>

In her third documentary, ''India Cabaret'', released in 1984, Nair pushed boundaries and produced her most controversial film, in which she reveals the exploitation of female strippers that populate [[Bombay]], and also follows a male customer who regularly visits a local strip club while his wife stays at home.<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu"/> Raising roughly $130,000 for the project, the fifty-nine minute film was shot over a span of two months, and was subject to criticism from Nair’s loved ones.<ref name="Applause Theater & Cinema Books"/><ref name="Mira Nair"/>

<br>By her fourth and last documentary that was made for [[Canadian television]], Nair kept up with the controversial film-making and explored [[amniocentesis]] and how it was being used to determine the sex of fetuses. Released in 1987, ''Children of a Desired Sex'' exposed how female fetuses were aborted due to a society favoring male offspring. Though this documentary did not receive much criticism for its controversial nature, Nair decided that it would be the last one she would produce and chose to go onto make fiction films.<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu"/>

===Feature films===

After departing the documentary film-making field, Nair had joined again with her old friend, [[Sooni Taraporevala]], and together the two began writing ''[[Salaam Bombay!]]'' five years before the film was released in 1988. Taking her documentary film-making and prior acting experience into account, Nair sought out for real “street children” to properly portray the reality of children who survive in the streets and are being deprived of a real childhood.<ref name="Applause Theater & Cinema Books"/> Though the film did not do well in the box office, the film won twenty-three international awards, and the most notable wins would be the Camera D’or and Prix du Publique at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1988. ''Salaam Bombay!'' was also nominated at the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crossette |first=Barabara |date=23 December 1990 |title=Homeless and Hungry Youths of India |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0DA1531F930A15751C1A966958260 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=13 October 2008 }}</ref>

Following the success of ''Salaam Bombay!'', Nair, alongside Taraporevala, continued challenge audiences once more by telling the story of Ugandan-born Indians displaced in [[Mississippi]] in her 1991 film, ''[[Mississippi Masala]]''.<ref name="Mira Nair"/> Unlike her prior film, the film stars experienced actors like [[Denzel Washington]], [[Roshan Seth]], and [[Sarita Choudhury]]. The film is centered on a carpet-cleaner business owner, played by Denzel Washington, who falls in love with the daughter of one of his Indian Clients, played by Sarita Choudhury. The relationship in the film reveals the evident prejudice in African-American and Indian communities. Like ''Salaam Bombay!'', the film was well-received by critics and even earned a standing ovation at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1992. The picture was also a recipient of three awards at the [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu"/> However, the film did receive backlash by some critics, claiming that Nair’s portrayal of her own ethnic group was overtly satirized and had a negative impact on the film.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Erika Surat|title=Review|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Summer 1993|volume=46|issue=4|pages=23–26|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref>

Nair went on to direct four more films before she produced one of her most notable films, ''[[Monsoon Wedding]]''. Released in 2001, the film told the story of a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] Indian wedding, written by [[Sabrina Dhawan]]. With only a small crew and some of Nair’s acquaintances and relatives as cast members, the film grossed over $30 million worldwide, which made it the most money ever made by an Indian film.<ref name="Mira Nair"/> In tradition with her controversial film-making, Nair has received criticism for her approach to a subplot in the film which involved an uncle molesting his niece. However, the film managed to be awarded the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]], making Nair the first female recipient of the award.<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitney |first=Anna |date=10 September 2001 |title=Indian director is first woman to win Golden Lion |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/indian-director-is-first-woman-to-win-golden-lion-9225222.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref>

In 2007, Nair was asked to direct [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]], but turned it down to work on her next notable film, ''[[The Namesake]]''.<ref name="Mira Nair"/> Based off the book of [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Jhumpa Lahiri]], Sooni Taraporevala’s screenplay follows the son of Indian immigrants who wants to fit in with [[New York]] society, but struggles to get away from his family’s traditional ways. The film was presented with the Darmouth Film Award, and was also honored with the Pride of India award at the [[Bollywood Movie Awards]].<ref>{{cite news |date=23 April 2007 |title=Bollywood to honour Mira Nair with 'Pride of India' award |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=a8b47023-270e-47f0-a6c2-399a750ab572& |newspaper=[[Hindustan Times]] |agency=Press Trust of India (PTI)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=28 May 2007 |title=Mira Nair, Asha Parekh honoured at Bollywood awards in New York |url=http://story.malaysiasun.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/f825b92e19df636a/id/252152/cs/1/ |newspaper=Malaysia Sun |agency=Indo-Asian News Service (IANS) |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120207004720/http://story.malaysiasun.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/f825b92e19df636a/id/252152/cs/1/ |archivedate=7 February 2012 |accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref>

For several years, Nair was attached to a big-budget adaptation of the novel ''[[Shantaram (film)|Shantaram]]'', but the production was shelved in 2009. Nair has also purchased the rights to [[Mohsin Hamid]]'s 2007 novel ''[[The Reluctant Fundamentalist]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bannerjee |first=Debesh |date=6 December 2009 |title= Politeness can kill you in movies |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/politeness-can-kill-you-in-movies/ |newspaper=The Indian Express |accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref>

Mira Nair has recently slated [[Govinda (actor)|Govinda]] to play the lead in her upcoming film ''The Bengali Detective''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mitra |first=Prithvijit |date=21 December 2013 |title=Mira chooses Govinda as Bengali sleuth |url=http://mobiletoi.timesofindia.com/mobile.aspx?article=yes&pageid=3&sectid=edid=&edlabel=TOIKM&mydateHid=21-12-2013&pubname=Times+of+India+-+Kolkata&edname=&articleid=Ar00310&publabel=TOI |newspaper=The Times of India |agency=Times News Network (TNN)}}</ref>

===Other work===

Following the making of ''Salaam Bombay!'', Nair created the [[Salaam Baalak Trust]], run by her mother, which helps children of [[Dehli]] who have been forced into prostitution.<ref name="Mira Nair"/> In 2004, she also founded [[Maisha Film Lab]] to help East Africans and South Asians learn to make films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maishafilmlab.org/about-us/background/ |title=Our Background |website=Maisha Film Lab}}</ref> Maisha is headquartered in Nair's adopted home of Kampala, Uganda.

She currently lives in [[New York City]], where she is an adjunct professor in the Film Division of the School of Arts for [[Columbia University]]. The university has a collaboration with Nair’s Maisha Film Lab, and offers opportunities for international students to work together and share their interests in film-making.<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Programs|url=http://arts.columbia.edu/global-programs?&home=1865|website=Columbia University School of the Arts|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>

==Personal life==

In 1977, Mira Nair met her first husband, [[Mitch Epstein]], when taking photography classes at [[Harvard University]].<ref name="Applause Theater & Cinema Books"/> They divorced by 1987, and in 1988 Nair met her husband [[Mahmood Mamdani]] while in [[Uganda]] doing research for the film ''[[Mississippi Masala]]''. Their son, Zorhan, was born in 1991. Like his wife, Mamdani also teaches at [[Columbia University]].<ref name="Mira Nair"/>

Nair has been an enthusiastic [[yoga]] practitioner for decades; when making a film, she has the cast and crew start the day with a yoga session.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dupont |first=Joan |date=21 September 2001 |title=Mira Nair Peels Back Layers Of Punjabi Society |url=http://mirabaifilms.com/wordpress/?page_id=32 |newspaper=International Herald Tribune |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228182413/http://mirabaifilms.com/wordpress/?page_id=32 |archivedate=28 December 2009}}</ref>

==Political views==
In July 2013, Nair declined an invitation to the [[Haifa International Film Festival]] as a "guest of honor" to protest [[Israel]]'s policies toward [[Palestine]]. In postings on her Twitter account, Nair stated "I will go to Israel when the walls come down. I will go to Israel when occupation is gone...I will go to Israel when the state does not privilege one religion over another. I will go to Israel when Apartheid is over. I will go to Israel, soon. I stand w/ [[Academic boycotts of Israel#The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel|Palestine for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel]] (PACBI) & the larger [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions]] (BDS) Mov’t." Nair was subsequently praised by PACBI, which stated that her decision to boycott Israel "helps to highlight the struggle against colonialism and apartheid." She subsequently tweeted "I will go to Israel, soon."<ref>{{cite news |date=21 July 2013 |title=Film director Mira Nair boycotting Haifa festival |url=http://www.jta.org/2013/07/21/arts-entertainment/indian-film-director-boycotts-haifa-film-festival#ixzz2Zoc86hVV |work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=23 July 2013 |title=Mira Nair turns down invite to Israel film festival |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hollywood/news-interviews/Mira-Nair-turns-down-invite-to-Israel-film-festival/articleshow/21240349.cms |newspaper=The Times of India |agency=Press Trust of India (PTI)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Sherwood |first=Harriet |date=21 July 2013 |title=Mira Nair boycotts Haifa film festival |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/21/director-mira-nair-boycotts-haifa-festival |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Anderman |first=Nirit |date=21 July 2013 |title=Prominent filmmaker boycotts Haifa festival to protest Israeli 'apartheid' |url=http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/.premium-1.537005 |work=[[Haaretz]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=20 July 2013 |title=Mira Nair boycotts Israel Film Festival in Palestine's support |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/579618/mira-nair-boycotts-israel-film-festival-in-palestines-support/ |newspaper=[[The Express Tribune]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=21 July 2013 |title=Award-winning director boycotts Haifa Film Festival to protest 'Apartheid'|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Award-winning-director-boycotts-Haifa-Film-Festival-to-protest-Apartheid-320514 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post}}</ref>
