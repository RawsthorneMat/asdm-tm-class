==Life and career==
Hirschbiegel was born in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany|Germany]]. A [[Waldorf School|Waldorf graduate]], Hirschbiegel studied painting and graphic arts, later film, at the [[Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg|Hamburg University of Fine Arts]]. In 1986, he directed his first film, the made-for-TV movie ''Das Go! Projekt'', the script for which he had written himself. He became a successful TV director, directing numerous episodes of the ''[[Tatort]]'' and ''Kommissar Rex'' series. His first theatrical release was the well-received movie ''[[Das Experiment]]''.

In 2004, he attracted world-wide attention with the film ''Der Untergang'' (released in English-speaking countries as ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Downfall]]''), produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]]. It recounts [[Adolf Hitler]]'s last days, and sparked an extensive debate in Germany over the portrayal of Nazi leaders. The film was a critical and commercial success, winning numerous awards and a nomination for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for the best foreign film. One scene from the film has become the basis for a widespread [[Downfall (2004 film)#Parodies|viral video phenomenon]].

He directed his first Hollywood feature ''[[The Invasion (film)|The Invasion]]'', which was partly re-shot by [[Australia]]n director [[James McTeigue]], at the request of the studio.

Hirschbiegel directed the biographical film ''[[Diana (film)|Diana]]'', about [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], which was released in September 2013. Actress [[Naomi Watts]] plays the title role.<ref name="BBC News">{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16968014 |title=Naomi Watts lands Princess Diana role  |accessdate=2012-02-10|work=BBC News|date=2012-02-09}}</ref>
