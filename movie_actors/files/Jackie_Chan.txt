== Early life ==
Chan was born on 7 April 1954, in [[British Hong Kong|British]] [[Hong Kong]], as Chan Kong-sang, to [[Charles and Lee-Lee Chan]], refugees from the [[Chinese Civil War]]. He was nicknamed ''Pao-pao'' {{zh|炮炮}} ("Cannonball") because the energetic child was always rolling around.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography of Jackie Chan |work=Biography |publisher=Hong Kong Film.net |url=http://www.hkfilm.net/chanbio.htm |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> His parents worked for the French ambassador in Hong Kong, and Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district.<ref name="Tiscali">{{cite web |title=Biography of Jackie Chan |work=Biography |publisher=[[Tiscali]] |url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/jackie-chan/biography/45 |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>

Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on [[Hong Kong Island]], where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school. In 1960, his father emigrated to [[Canberra]], Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a [[Peking Opera School]] run by Master [[Yu Jim-yuen]].<ref name="Tiscali"/><ref name="CelebValues">{{cite web |title=Jackie Chan Battles Illegal Wildlife Trade |publisher=Celebrity Values |url=http://www.celebrityvalues.com/jackie_chan.html |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>
Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography of Jackie Chan |publisher=StarPulse |url=http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Chan,_Jackie/Biography/ |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> He eventually became part of the [[Seven Little Fortunes]], a performance group made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]], and the three of them later became known as the ''Three Brothers'' or ''Three Dragons''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Seven Little Fortunes |work=Feature article |publisher=LoveAsianFilm |url=http://www.loveasianfilm.com/features/sevenlittlefortunes.html |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> After entering the film industry, Chan along with Sammo Hung got the opportunity to train in [[Hapkido]] under the grand master Jin Pal Kim, and Chan eventually attained a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web-vue.com/hapkido.htm |title=Jackie Chan's Hapkido Master |publisher=Web-vue.com |accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>

He began his career by appearing in small roles at the age of five. At age eight, he appeared with some of his fellow "Little Fortunes" in the film ''[[Big and Little Wong Tin Bar]]'' (1962) with Li Li Hua playing his mother. Chan appeared with Li again the following year, in ''[[The Love Eterne]]'' (1963) and had a small role in [[King Hu]]'s 1966 film ''[[Come Drink with Me]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Come Drink With Me (1966) |work=Database entry |publisher=[[Hong Kong Cinemagic]] |url=http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/movie.asp?id=2418&showmovfullcast=1 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> In 1971, after an appearance as an extra in another kung fu film, ''[[A Touch of Zen]]'', Chan was signed to Chu Mu's Great Earth Film Company.<ref name="Whoami">{{Cite video |title=[[Who Am I?

== Film career ==
{{main|Jackie Chan filmography}}

=== Early exploits: 1976–1979 ===
[[File:Jackie Chan Fist.JPG|thumb|right|upright0.1|Jackie Chan began his film career as a [[stuntman]] in the [[Bruce Lee]] films ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972) and ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (1973, pictured).]]
In 1976, Jackie Chan received a telegram from [[Willie Chan]], a film producer in the Hong Kong film industry who had been impressed with Jackie's stunt work. Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by [[Lo Wei]]. Lo had seen Chan's performance in the [[John Woo]] film ''[[Hand of Death]]'' (1976) and planned to model him after [[Bruce Lee]] with the film ''[[New Fist of Fury]]''.<ref name="Whoami"/> His stage name was changed to Sing Lung ({{zh|成龍}}, also transcribed as Cheng Long,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kungfu.chinaa2z.com/kungfu/html/Kung%20Fu%20Star/2008/20081225/20081225165205590921/20081225172231339876.html |title=Jackie Chan: Chinese Kung Fu Superstar |publisher=ChinaA2Z.com |author=lily |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090408082259/http://kungfu.chinaa2z.com/kungfu/html/Kung%20Fu%20Star/2008/20081225/20081225165205590921/20081225172231339876.html |archivedate=8 April 2009 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> literally "become the dragon") to emphasise his similarity to Bruce Lee, whose stage name meant "Little Dragon" in Chinese. The film was unsuccessful because Chan was not accustomed to Lee's martial arts style. Despite the film's failure, Lo Wei continued producing films with similar themes, but with little improvement at the box office.<ref name="FightingMaster">{{cite web |title=Jackie Chan, a martial arts success story |work=Biography |publisher=Fighting Master |url=http://www.fightingmaster.com/actors/jackie/index.htm |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>

Chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 film ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'', shot while he was loaned to Seasonal Film Corporation under a two-picture deal.<ref name="Jcm">{{cite web |title=Jackie Chan Biography (an Asian perspective) |work=Biography |publisher=Ng Kwong Loong (JackieChanMovie.com) |url=http://www.jackiechanmovie.com/profile/biography/bio.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040402123601/http://www.jackiechanmovie.com/profile/biography/bio.htm |archivedate=2 April 2004 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> Director [[Yuen Woo-ping]] allowed Chan complete freedom over his stunt work. The film established the comedic kung fu genre, and proved refreshing to the Hong Kong audience.<ref>{{cite web |last= Pollard |first=Mark |title=Snake in the Eagle's Shadow |work=Movie review |publisher=Kung Fu Cinema |url=http://www.kungfucinema.com/reviews/snake-in-the-eagles-shadow-1978 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> Chan then starred in ''[[Drunken Master]]'', which finally propelled him to mainstream success.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pollard |first=Mark |title=Drunken Master |work=Movie review |publisher=Kung Fu Cinema |url=http://www.kungfucinema.com/reviews/drunken-master-1978 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>

Upon Chan's return to Lo Wei's studio, Lo tried to replicate the comedic approach of ''Drunken Master'', producing ''[[Half a Loaf of Kung Fu]]'' and ''[[Spiritual Kung Fu]]''.<ref name="Iamjc"/> He also gave Chan the opportunity to co-direct ''[[The Fearless Hyena]]'' with [[Kenneth Tsang]]. When Willie Chan left the company, he advised Jackie to decide for himself whether or not to stay with Lo Wei. During the shooting of ''[[Fearless Hyena Part II]]'', Chan broke his contract and joined [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]], prompting Lo to blackmail Chan with [[Triad (underground society)|triads]], blaming Willie for his star's departure. The dispute was resolved with the help of fellow actor and director [[Jimmy Wang Yu]], allowing Chan to stay with Golden Harvest.<ref name="Jcm"/>

=== Success in the action comedy genre: 1980–1987 ===
Willie Chan became Jackie's personal manager and firm friend, and has remained so for over 30 years. He was instrumental in launching Chan's international career, beginning with his first forays into the [[American film industry]] in the 1980s. His first Hollywood film was ''[[The Big Brawl]]'' in 1980.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Big Brawl |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=31 December 1979|url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117789217?refcatid=31|accessdate=31 May 2012}}</ref> Chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film ''[[The Cannonball Run]],'' which grossed $100&nbsp;million worldwide. Despite being largely ignored by audiences in favour of established American actors such as [[Burt Reynolds]], Chan was impressed by the [[outtake]]s shown at the [[closing credits]], inspiring him to include the same device in his future films.

After the commercial failure of ''[[The Protector (1985 film)|The Protector]]'' in 1985, Chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into the US market, returning his focus to [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong films]].<ref name="FightingMaster"/>

Back in Hong Kong, Chan's films began to reach a larger audience in East Asia, with early successes in the lucrative Japanese market including ''[[The Young Master]]'' (1980) and ''[[Dragon Lord]]'' (1982). ''The Young Master'' went on to beat previous box office records set by [[Bruce Lee]] and established Chan as Hong Kong cinema's top star. With ''Dragon Lord'', he began experimenting with elaborate [[stunt]] action sequences,<ref>{{cite web |title=Dragon Lord |publisher=Love HK Film |url=http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews_2/dragon_lord.htm |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> including the final fight scene where he performs various stunts, including one where he does a back flip off a loft and falls to the lower ground.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kicking and Screening: ''Wheels on Meals,'' ''Armour of God,'' ''Police Story,'' and more are graded with an eye for action |author=David Everitt |date=16 August 1996 |work=Entertainment Weekly |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293788,00.html |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>

Chan produced a number of action comedy films with his opera school friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. The three co-starred together for the first time in 1983 in ''[[Project A]],'' which introduced a dangerous stunt-driven style of martial arts that won it the Best Action Design Award at the third annual [[Hong Kong Film Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Project A Review |work=Film review |publisher=Hong Kong Cinema |url=http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews/project_a.htm |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> Over the following two years, the "Three Brothers" appeared in ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' and the original ''[[Lucky Stars]]'' trilogy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sammo Hung Profile |publisher=Kung Fu Cinema |url=http://www.kungfucinema.com/people/sammo_hung_kam_bo.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070529210629/http://www.kungfucinema.com/people/sammo_hung_kam_bo.htm |archivedate=29 May 2007 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Yuen Biao Profile |publisher=Kung Fu Cinema |url=http://www.kungfucinema.com/people/yuen_biao.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070415122914/http://www.kungfucinema.com/people/yuen_biao.htm |archivedate=15 April 2007 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> In 1985, Chan made the first ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' film, a US-influenced action comedy in which Chan performed a number of dangerous stunts.

The film was Chan's biggest domestic box office success up to that point, grossing over HK$35&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Armour of God |publisher=jackiechanmovie.com |year=2006 |url=http://www.jackiechanmovie.com/Reviews/AOG/Review.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040903175112/http://www.jackiechanmovie.com/Reviews/AOG/Review.htm |archivedate=3 September 2004 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>

=== Acclaimed sequels and Hollywood breakthrough: 1988–1998 ===
In 1988, Chan starred alongside Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao for the last time to date, in the film ''[[Dragons Forever]]''. Hung co-directed with [[Corey Yuen]], and the villain in the film was played by [[Yuen Wah]], both of whom were fellow graduates of the China Drama Academy.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Chan starred in a number of successful sequels beginning with ''[[Police Story 2]]'', which won the award for Best Action Choreography at the 1989 [[Hong Kong Film Awards]]. This was followed by ''[[Armour of God II: Operation Condor]]'', and ''[[Police Story 3: Super Cop]]'', for which Chan won the Best Actor Award at the 1993 [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards|Golden Horse Film Festival]]. In 1994, Chan reprised his role as [[Wong Fei-hung]] in ''[[Drunken Master II]]'', which was listed in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine's]]'' All-Time 100 Movies.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Drunken Master II&nbsp;– All-Time 100 Movies |work=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/0,23220,drunken_master_ii,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050711081925/http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/0,23220,drunken_master_ii,00.html |archivedate=11 July 2005 |date=12 February 2005 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> Another sequel, ''[[Police Story 4: First Strike]]'', brought more awards and domestic box office success for Chan, but did not fare as well in foreign markets.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kozo |title=Police Story 4 review |work=Film review |publisher=LoveHKFilm |url=http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews_2/police_story4_first_strike.htm |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>

Chan rekindled his [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] ambitions in the 1990s, but refused early offers to play villains in Hollywood films to avoid being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in future roles. For example, [[Sylvester Stallone]] offered him the role of [[Simon Phoenix]], a criminal in the futuristic film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]''. Chan declined and the role was taken by [[Wesley Snipes]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Dickerson |first=Jeff |title=Black Delights in Demolition Man |work=The Michigan Daily |date=4 April 2002 |url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2002/04/04/TheStatement/Black.Delights.In.demolition.Man-1403498.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071224001408/http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2002/04/04/TheStatement/Black.Delights.In.demolition.Man-1403498.shtml |archivedate= 24 December 2007 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>

Chan finally succeeded in establishing a foothold in the North American market in 1995 with a worldwide release of ''[[Rumble in the Bronx]]'', attaining a [[cult following]] in the United States that was rare for Hong Kong movie stars.<ref>{{cite web |last=Morris |first=Gary |title=Rumble in the Bronx review |work=Bright Lights Film Journal |date=April 1996 |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/16/chan.html |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> The success of ''Rumble in the Bronx'' led to a 1996 release of ''[[Police Story 3: Super Cop]]'' in the United States under the title ''Supercop'', which grossed a total of US$16,270,600. Chan's first huge blockbuster success came when he co-starred with [[Chris Tucker]] in the 1998 [[buddy cop]] action comedy ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]'',<ref>{{cite web |first=Raffi |title=Rush Hour Review |work=Film Review |publisher=BeijingWushuTeam.com |date=15 September 1998 |url=http://www.beijingwushuteam.com/articles/rushhour.html |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> grossing US$130&nbsp;million in the United States alone.<ref name="Jcm" /> This film made him a Hollywood star, after which he wrote his autobiography in collaboration with [[Jeff Yang]] entitled ''[[I Am Jackie Chan]]''.

=== Fame in Hollywood and Dramatization: 1999–2007 ===
[[File:Jet Li & Jackie Chan.jpg|thumb||Jet Li and Jackie Chan]]

In 1998, Chan released his final film for Golden Harvest, ''[[Who Am I? (1998 film)|Who Am I?]]''. After leaving Golden Harvest in 1999, he produced and starred alongside [[Shu Qi]] in ''[[Gorgeous (film)|Gorgeous]]'' a romantic comedy that focused on personal relationships and featured only a few martial arts sequences.<ref>{{Cite video |people=Jackie Chan |title=Gorgeous, commentary track |medium=DVD |publisher=Uca Catalogue |year=1999}}</ref> Chan then helped create a [[PlayStation]] game in 2000 called ''[[Jackie Chan Stuntmaster]]'', to which he lent his voice and performed the motion capture.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gerstmann |first=Jeff |title=Jackie Chan Stuntmaster Review |publisher=Gamespot |date=14 January 2007 |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/jackie-chan-stuntmaster/reviews/jackie-chans-stuntmaster-review-2547937/ |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> He continued his Hollywood success in 2000 when he teamed up with [[Owen Wilson]] in the [[Western (genre)|Western]] action comedy ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' which spawned the sequel ''[[Shanghai Knights]]'' (2003).<ref>

He reunited with Chris Tucker for ''[[Rush Hour 2]]'' (2001) which was an even bigger success than the original grossing $347 million worldwide. He experimented with special effects with ''[[The Tuxedo]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Medallion]]'' (2003) which were not as successful critically or commercially. In 2004 he teamed up with [[Steve Coogan]] in the big-budget loose [[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|adaptation]] of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the World in 80 Days]]''.

Despite the success of the ''Rush Hour'' and ''Shanghai Noon'' films, Chan became frustrated with Hollywood over the limited range of roles and lack of control over the filmmaking process.<ref name="Obio">{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Jackie |title=Jackie Chan Biography |work=Official website of Jackie Chan |url=http://jackiechan.com/about/about_bio.html |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> In response to Golden Harvest's withdrawal from the film industry in 2003, Chan started his own film production company, [[JCE Movies Limited]] (Jackie Chan Emperor Movies Limited) in association with [[Emperor Multimedia Group]] (EMG).<ref name="Jcm"/> His films have since featured an increasing number of dramatic scenes while continuing to succeed at the box office; examples include ''[[New Police Story]]'' (2004), ''[[The Myth (film)|The Myth]]'' (2005) and the hit film ''[[Rob-B-Hood]]'' (2006).<ref>{{cite web |title=New Police Story Review |publisher=LoveHKFilm |url=http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews_2/new_police_story.htm |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Myth Review |publisher=Karazen |url=http://www.karazen.com/reviews/movies/themyth.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051028034336/http://www.karazen.com/reviews/movies/themyth.php |archivedate=28 October 2005 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rob-B-Hood Review |publisher=HkFlix |url=http://www.hkcuk.co.uk/reviews/rob_b_hood.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011073526/http://hkcuk.co.uk/reviews/rob_b_hood.htm |archivedate=11 October 2007 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>

== Stunts and screen persona ==

Chan has performed most of his own stunts throughout his film career, which are choreographed by the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]]. He has stated in interviews that the primary inspiration for his more comedic stunts were films such as ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]'' directed by and starring [[Buster Keaton]], who was also known to perform his own stunts. Since its establishment in 1983, Chan has used the team in all his subsequent films to make choreographing easier, given his understanding of each member's abilities.<ref>{{Cite video |people=Jackie Chan |title=Police Story Commentary |medium=DVD |publisher=Dragon Dynasty |location=Hong Kong |year=1987}}</ref> Chan and his team undertake many of the stunts performed by other characters in his films, shooting the scenes so that their faces are obscured.<ref name="Newline">{{cite web |last=Rogers |first=Ian |title=Jackie Chan Interview |publisher=FilmZone |url=http://www.newline.com/jackiechan/Chan/chaninterview.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070710114138/http://www.newline.com/jackiechan/Chan/chaninterview.html |archivedate=10 July 2007 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>

The dangerous nature of his stunts makes it difficult for Chan to get insurance, especially in the United States, where his stunt work is contractually limited.<ref name="Newline"/> Chan holds the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for "Most Stunts by a Living Actor", which emphasises "no insurance company will underwrite Chan's productions in which he performs all his own stunts".<ref>{{cite web |title=January 2003 News Archives |work=Jackie Chan Kids |url=http://www.jackiechankids.com/files/January_News_Archives.htm

Chan has been injured frequently when attempting stunts; many of them have been shown as outtakes or as [[blooper]]s during the closing credits of his films. He came closest to death filming ''[[Armour of God (film)|Armour of God]]'', when he fell from a tree and fractured his skull. Over the years, Chan has dislocated his pelvis and also broken numerous parts of body including his fingers, toes, nose, both cheekbones, hips, sternum, neck, ankle, and ribs.<ref>{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Jackie |title=The Official Jackie Chan Injury Map |publisher=Jackie Chan Kids |url=http://www.jackiechankids.com/files/Jackie_Injury_Map_Main.htm |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jackie Chan re-injures back while filming |work=The Star |location=Malaysia |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/8/27/apworld/20070827170114&sec=apworld |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> Promotional materials for ''Rumble in the Bronx'' emphasised that Chan performed all of the stunts, and one version of the movie poster even diagrammed his many injuries.

[[File:Jackie Chan Cannes 2013.jpg|thumb|upright0.1|Jackie Chan at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
Chan created his screen persona as a response to the late [[Bruce Lee]], and the [[Bruceploitation|numerous imitators]] who appeared before and after Lee's death. In contrast to Lee's characters, who were typically stern, morally upright heroes, Chan plays well-meaning, slightly foolish regular men (often at the mercy of their friends, girlfriends or families) who always triumph in the end despite the odds.<ref name="Iamjc"/> Additionally, Chan has stated that he deliberately styles his movement to be the opposite of Lee's: where Lee held his arms wide, Chan holds his tight to the body; where Lee was loose and flowing, Chan is tight and choppy. Despite the success of the ''[[Rush Hour (film series)|Rush Hour]]'' series, Chan has stated that he is not a fan of it since he neither appreciates the action scenes in the movie, nor understands American humour.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,298648,00.html |title=Jackie Chan Admits He Is Not a Fan of 'Rush Hour' Films |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=30 September 2007 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref>

Referring to his participation in the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay|torch relay]] for the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing]], Chan spoke out against demonstrators who disrupted the relay several times attempting to draw attention to a wide-ranging number of grievances against the Chinese government. He warned those "publicity seekers" planning to stop him from carrying the Olympic Torch "not get anywhere near me." Chan said that China was trying to improve and the Olympics is a chance for the country to open up and learn from the outside world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/oddballs/143026-kung-fu-star-jackie-chan-to-chop-down-olympic-protestors |title=Kung-fu star Jackie Chan to chop down Olympic protesters |work=Metro|location=UK |date=15 April 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090427012524/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090421/ap_en_ot/as_hong_kong_people_jackie_chan |archivedate=27 April 2009 |accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref>

In 2009, Chan was named an "anti-drug ambassador" by the Chinese government, actively taking part in anti-drug campaigns and supporting President Xi Jinping's declaration that illegal drugs should be wiped out and users should be severely punished. In 2014, when his own son Jaycee was arrested for cannabis use, he said that he was "angry", "shocked", "heartbroken" and "ashamed" of his son. He also said, "I hope all young people will learn a lesson from Jaycee and stay far from the harm of drugs.
