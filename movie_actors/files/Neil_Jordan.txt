'''Neil Patrick Jordan''' (born 25 February 1950) is an Irish film director, screenwriter and novelist. He won an Academy Award ([[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]) for ''[[The Crying Game]]''. He also won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] at the [[48th Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin International Film Festival]] for ''[[The Butcher Boy (1997 film)|The Butcher Boy]]''.<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1998/03_preistr_ger_1998/03_Preistraeger_1998.html |title=Berlinale: 1998 Prize Winners |accessdate=2012-01-15 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

==Early life==
Jordan was born in [[County Sligo]], the son of Angela (née O'Brien), a painter, and Michael Jordan, a professor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/73/Neil-Jordan.html |title=Neil Jordan Biography (1950–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-26}}</ref> He was educated at [[St. Paul's College, Raheny]]. Of his religious background, Jordan said in a 1999 ''[[Salon Magazine|Salon]]'' interview: "I was brought up a Catholic and was quite religious at one stage in my life, when I was young. But it left me with no scars whatever; it just sort of vanished." He said about his current beliefs that "God is the greatest imaginary being of all time. Along with Einstein's [[General Theory of Relativity]], the invention of God is probably the greatest creation of human thought."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/12/09/jordan/index.html|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|first=Michael|last=Sragow|date=9 December 1999|title=Beautiful Dreamer}}</ref> Later, Jordan attended [[University College Dublin]], where he studied Irish history and English literature.

==Career==

===Film===
When [[John Boorman]] was filming ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' in Ireland, he recruited Jordan as a "creative associate". A year later Boorman was executive producer on Jordan's first feature ''[[Angel (1982 Irish film)|Angel]]'', a tale of a musician caught up in the Troubles, starred [[Stephen Rea]] who has subsequently appeared in almost all of Jordan's films to date. During the 1980s, he directed films that won him acclaim, including ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'' and ''[[Mona Lisa (film)|Mona Lisa]]'', both made in England. ''The Company of Wolves'' became a cult favorite.

As a writer/director, Jordan has a highly idiosyncratic body of work, ranging from mainstream hits like ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' to commercial failures like ''[[We're No Angels (1989 film)|We're No Angels]]'' to a variety of more personal, low-budget [[arthouse]] pictures. He was also the driving force behind the cable TV series ''[[The Borgias (2011 TV series)|The Borgias]]''.

Unconventional sexual relationships are a recurring theme in Jordan's work, and he often finds a sympathetic side to characters that audiences would traditionally consider deviant or downright horrifying. His film ''[[The Miracle (1991 film)|The Miracle]]'', for instance, followed two characters who struggled to resist a strong, incestuous attraction, while ''[[The Crying Game]]'' made complicated, likable characters out of an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] [[terrorist]] and a [[transgender]] woman. ''[[The Vampire Chronicles|Interview with the Vampire]]'', like the [[Anne Rice]] book it was based on, focused on the intense, intimate interpersonal relationship of two undead men who murder humans nightly (although the pair never have sex, they are clearly lovers of a sort), accompanied by an equally lusty vampire woman who is eternally trapped in the body of a little girl. While Lestat ([[Tom Cruise]]) is depicted in an attractive but villainous manner, his partner Louis ([[Brad Pitt]]) and the child vampire Claudia ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) are meant to capture the audience's sympathy despite their predatory nature. In the remake of ''[[The End of the Affair]]'', two people ([[Ralph Fiennes]] and [[Julianne Moore]]) engage in a love affair that will end as suddenly as it started, with both not wanting its end.

In addition to the unusual sexuality of Jordan's films, he frequently returns to the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] of [[Northern Ireland]]. ''The Crying Game'' and ''[[Breakfast on Pluto (film)|Breakfast on Pluto]]'' both concern a transgender character (played by [[Jaye Davidson]] and [[Cillian Murphy]], respectively), both concern the Troubles, and both feature frequent Jordan leading man [[Stephen Rea]]. The two films, however, are very different, with ''Crying Game'' being a realistic thriller/romance and ''Breakfast on Pluto'' a much more episodic, stylized, darkly comic biography. Jordan also frequently tells stories about children or young people, such as ''The Miracle'' and ''[[The Butcher Boy (1997 film)|The Butcher Boy]]''. While his pictures are most often grounded in reality, he occasionally directs more fantastic or dreamlike films, such as ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'', ''[[High Spirits (film)|High Spirits]],'' ''Interview with the Vampire''  and ''[[In Dreams (film)|In Dreams]]''.

The critical success of Jordan's early pictures led him to Hollywood, where he directed ''[[High Spirits (film)|High Spirits]]'' and ''[[We're No Angels (1989 film)|We're No Angels]]''; both were critical and financial disasters. He later returned home to make the more personal ''[[The Crying Game]]'', which was nominated for six Academy Awards. Jordan won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film. Its unexpected success led him back to American studio filmmaking, where he directed ''[[Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles]]''. He also directed the crime drama ''[[The Brave One (2007 film)|The Brave One]]'' starring Jodie Foster.

Neil Gaiman announced during his ''The Today Show'' appearance on 27 January 2009, that Neil Jordan would be directing the film of his Newbery Medal-winning book ''The Graveyard Book''. Jordan also wrote and directed the Irish made film ''[[Ondine (film)|Ondine]]'' (2009), starring [[Colin Farrell]] and [[Alicja Bachleda-Curuś]]. He also directed ''[[Byzantium (film)|Byzantium]]'', an adaptation of the vampire play of the same name starring [[Saoirse Ronan]], [[Gemma Arterton]] and [[Jonny Lee Miller]].<ref name=byzantium>{{cite web|title=Saoirse Ronan and Gemma Arterton to Star in Vampire Pic 'Byzantium' (Cannes) |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/saoirse-ronan-gemma-arterton-star-188454 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first = Stuart |last=Kemp |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref>

Neil Jordan's next feature is entitled ''Broken Dream'' and will feature [[Ben Kingsley]] and [[John Hurt]].<ref name="Broken Dream">{{cite web|url=http://iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&only=1&aid=73&rid=4283808&tpl=archnews&force=1|title=Ben Kinglsey & John Hurt for Neil Jordan - John Boorman's 'Broken Dream' |publisher=IFTN |accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Jordan has five children: Anna and Sarah from his marriage to solicitor Vivienne Shields; Dashiel Jordan and Daniel Jordan from his current marriage to Brenda Rawn and Ben, a child from a brief relationship with architect Mary Donohoe.

Jordan lives in a house in [[Dalkey]], which is a part of the larger town of [[Dún Laoghaire]].<ref>[http://www.dublintourist.com/towns/dalkey/ Famous People of Dalkey']</ref>
