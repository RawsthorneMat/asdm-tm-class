'''James Best''' (born '''Jewel Franklin Guy'''; July 26, 1926&nbsp;– April 6, 2015) was an American actor, who in six decades of television is best known for his starring role as bumbling [[Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane]] in the [[CBS]] television series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]''. He also worked as an acting coach, artist, college professor, and musician.

==Early years==
Best was born as '''Jewel Franklin Guy'''<ref name="officialwebsite"/> on July 26, 1926, in [[Powderly, Kentucky]], to Lark and Lena Guy. His mother was the sister of Ike Everly, the father of the pop duo [[The Everly Brothers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1752899/dukes-of-hazzards-james-best-dies-at-age-88|title=Dukes of Hazzard's James Best Dies at Age 88|work=CMT|date=April 7, 2015|accessdate=April 7, 2015|author=Staff}}</ref> After his mother died of tuberculosis in 1929, then three-year-old James was sent to live in an orphanage. He was later adopted by Armen Best (1897-1984) and his wife Essa (1896-1988)<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0078940/bio Profile], imdb.com; accessed April 7, 2015.</ref> and went to live with them in [[Corydon, Indiana]]. He served honorably in [[World War II]], training in 1944 in Biloxi, Mississippi as a gunner on a B-17 bomber, but by the time he finished training the war was almost at an end and he joined the Military Police.  As an MP, Best played a role in bringing stability to war-torn Germany immediately after their surrender.  While stationed in Germany, Best transferred out of the MP and joined a special services unit of actors for the US Army that travelled around Europe performing plays for the troops.  This was the true beginning of his acting career.<ref>Best in Hollywood: The Good, The Bad, And The Beautiful, by James Best with Jim Clark. Albany, 2009. BearManor Media; ISBN 1-59393-460-2.

===''The Dukes of Hazzard''===
Best played Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on CBS's ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' from the debut of the program in 1979 until the series ended in 1985. This role was Best's most visible success. He later revealed that the caricature-like persona of Sheriff Coltrane was developed from a voice that he used when playing with his young children. On set, Best was particularly close to [[Sorrell Booke]], who played the character of [[Boss Hogg]], who was both the boss and the brother-in-law of Rosco. The two actors became close friends and according to interviews by the series creators, the two would often improvise their scenes together, making up their own dialogue as they went along. Until his death, he also remained close to [[Catherine Bach]], who played the character of [[Daisy Duke]], and long after the show's cancellation, she was a regular visitor to the website dedicated to Best's painting.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/artists/catherine-bach/biography Catherine Bach profile], mtv.com; accessed April 7, 2015.</ref>

===Later career===
In 1991, in contrast to the comical Rosco Coltrane of ''Dukes of Hazzard'', Best appeared in an episode of the NBC crime drama ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]''. He won the [[Crystal Reel Award]] for ''Best Actor'' for his portrayal of Nathan Bedford in the episode "[[Sweet, Sweet Blues]]", directed by [[Vincent McEveety]] and written by [[William James Royce]], Best plays a retired Sheriff and repentant killer who has to come to terms with being involved in the death of now Sparta police officer Sweet's grandfather.<ref name="filminflorida.com">[http://www.filminflorida.com/wh/ViewNewsItem.asp?id=961 Profile], filminflorida.com; accessed April 7, 2015.</ref>

He later moved to [[Florida]] and taught at the [[University of Central Florida]] ([[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]). After semi-retiring, Best ran a production company and took occasional acting roles. He also earned a name for himself as an artist and painter. Best formerly resided in Lake Murray, South Carolina before moving once again, this time to [[Hickory, North Carolina]]. An acting coach, Best taught drama and acting techniques for more than a quarter century in Los Angeles. He also served as artist-in-residence and taught drama at the [[University of Mississippi]] ([[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]]) for two years prior to his stint on ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]''. In 2009, he completed his autobiography, ''Best In Hollywood: The Good, The Bad and The Beautiful''. The book, published in 2009 through Bear Manor Media, premiered at the Mid Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in [[Aberdeen, Maryland]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

On November 9, 2014, Best and fellow actor [[Robert Fuller (actor)|Robert Fuller]] (along with their wives) attended the 100th birthday celebration of lifelong friend and fellow actor, [[Norman Lloyd]]. Best said, "I had the honor to have been directed by Norman in a Hitchcock episode called "The Jar". Having worked with hundreds of directors in my career, I found very few that had Norman's qualities. He was most kind, gracious and patient with his actors. He is in all respects a complete gentleman in his personal life and I found it a genuine pleasure just to be in the presence of such a talented man. I am also doubly honored to consider him my friend. We are so blessed to have such a man among us for so long."<ref>[http://yesweekly.com/article-permalink-19001.html Best comments on Norman Lloyd], yesweekly.com; accessed April 7, 2015.</ref>

==Personal life and death==
In 1959, Best married his second wife, Jobee Ayers. The couple had two daughters, Janeen and Jojami. They divorced in 1977. Best also had a son, Gary, from a previous marriage. He married his third (and last) wife, Dorothy Collier, in 1986.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} His niece is actress [[Jennifer Lyons]].<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0529078/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm</ref>

Best died on April 6, 2015, in [[Hickory, North Carolina]] from complications of pneumonia. He was 88.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/tv/media-scene-blog/article17597600.html|title=James Best, sheriff of 'Hazzard', dies in Hickory at 88|last=Washburn|first=Mark|date=April 7, 2015|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>
