===''Super Size Me''===
{{Main|Super Size Me}}
[[File:MSpurlockSundance08.jpg|thumb|Spurlock at the [[2008 Sundance Film Festival]]]]
Spurlock's docudrama ''Super Size Me'' was released in the U.S. on May 7, 2004. This production was later nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Documentary feature. He conceived the idea for the film when he was at his parents' house for Thanksgiving, and while watching TV saw a news story about a lawsuit brought against McDonald's by two teenage girls who blamed the fast food chain for their obesity.

The film depicts an experiment he conducted in 2003, in which he ate three [[McDonald's]] meals a day every day (and nothing else) for 30 days. The film's title derives from one of the rules of Spurlock's experiment: he would not refuse the "super-size" option whenever it was offered to him and would never ask for it himself. The result, according to Spurlock, was a diet with twice the [[calories]] recommended by the USDA. Further, Spurlock attempted to curtail his physical activity to better match the exercise habits of the average American (he previously walked about 3 miles a day, whereas the average American walks 1.5 miles).

He was of above average health and fitness when he started the project; he gained 25 pounds (11&nbsp;kg), became quite puffy, suffered [[liver]] dysfunction and depression by the end. Spurlock's supervising physicians noted the effects caused by his high-calorie diet—once even comparing it to a case of severe binge alcoholism.

After the completion of the project, it took Spurlock fourteen months to return to his normal weight of 185 pounds (84&nbsp;kg).  His then-girlfriend (now ex-wife), [[Alex Jamieson|Alexandra Jamieson]], took charge of his recovery with her "[[detox diet]]", which became the basis for her book, ''The Great American Detox Diet''.<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1405077719/ Great American Detox Diet on Amazon.com]</ref>

Spurlock's second feature documentary, ''[[Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?]]'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2008.

==''30 Days''==
{{Main|30 Days (TV series)}}

In each episode, a person (who, in some cases, is Spurlock himself) or a group of people spend 30 days immersing themselves in a mode of life markedly different from their norm (being in prison, a devout Christian living in a Muslim family, a homophobe staying with a homosexual person, etc.), while Spurlock discusses the relevant social issues involved. [[FX Networks|FX]] began airing the show on June 15, 2005. In the premiere episode of the first season, "Minimum Wage," Spurlock and his fiancée lived for 30 days in [[the Bottoms]] neighborhood of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], Ohio, earning [[minimum wage]], with no access to outside funds.

In the second season finale, Spurlock spent 25 days locked in a [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico County]], Virginia (a county outside of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]) jail to experience life as an inmate.<ref name=theage1>[[Associated Press]], [http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/spurlock-behind-bars/2006/06/13/1149964504421.html "Spurlock to go behind bars"]. June 13, 2006.</ref> He did not complete the entire 30 days in jail because the majority of inmates in the state of Virginia serve 85% of the sentence, so once Spurlock reached that benchmark, he was released from the prison.<ref>FX "Thirty Days: Season 2 on the FX Network, Season Finale Episode.</ref>
