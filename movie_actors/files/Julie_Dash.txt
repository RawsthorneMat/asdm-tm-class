'''Julie Dash''' (born October 22, 1952) is an American [[filmmaker]], author and member of the [[L.A. Rebellion]]. Her ''[[Daughters of the Dust]]'' (1992) was the first full-length [[film]] by an African-American woman with general theatrical release in the United States. Dash is the film's producer, screenwriter and director. In 2004, ''Daughters of the Dust'' was included in the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]].

One of a generation of African and African-American filmmakers from the [[UCLA Film School]] who have created an alternative to [[Hollywood]] films, Dash has also made numerous music videos and television movies, the latter including ''Funny Valentines'' (1999), ''Incognito'' (1999), ''Love Song'' (2000), and ''[[The Rosa Parks Story]]'' (2002). Her ''Brothers of the Borderland'' (2004) was commissioned by the [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]].

Dash's book ''Daughters of the Dust: A Novel'' (1997) is a sequel to the film, set 20 years later in [[Harlem]] and the [[Sea Islands]].

==Early life==
Julie Dash was born on October 22, 1952 in [[Queens]], [[New York]]. Her father, a [[Gullah]] from the Sea Islands of Georgia, raised her.<ref name="juliedash.tv">[http://juliedash.tv/blog3/bio/ "Bio-Julie Dash"], Julie Dash Blog</ref> In an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' Dash said that she knew little about her [[Sea Islands|Sea Island]] heritage until she noticed her father's "funny accent." She learned years later that it was Gullah, a West African-influenced English creole used and preserved by people on the islands and in the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Low Country]] of Georgia, South Carolina, and northeastern Florida, together with a particular culture. As a child she noted certain rituals by her nanny, a Gullah woman; for instance, the woman would burn strands of Dash's hair that came loose after combing, rather than throwing them in a wastebasket. She told Dash this was "so no one could get a hold of it" and suggested "hiding [her] pictures so no one could put gopher dust on them and drive you crazy.".<ref name="King">[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-classic-hollywood-20111003,0,5919091.story Susan King, "The 'L.A. Rebellion' returns"], ''The Los Angeles Times,'' 3 October 2011</ref>

Dash began her study of film in 1969 at the [[Studio Museum]] of Harlem. As an undergraduate, she studied psychology until accepted into the film school at the Leonard Davis Center for the Performing Arts at [[CCNY]]. In 1974, she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree. As a student, Dash wrote the script for a documentary for the New York Urban Coalition, entitled ''Working Models of Success''.

After graduation, she moved to Los Angeles for graduate studies, attending the Center for Advanced Film Studies at the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI). There she studied under filmmakers including [[Jan Kadar]], [[William Friedkin]], and [[Slavko Vorkapich]]. She attended graduate school at the UCLA Film School, one of a new generation of African and African-American filmmakers who became known as the [[L.A. Rebellion]].<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/person/86772/Julie-Dash/biography "Julie Dash"], ''New York Times"</ref><ref name='Washington-Post'>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/01/AR2007060100494.html |title=From L.A.

She directed ''Working Models of Success'' (1976), and the next year, produced ''Four Women'' (1977), a short dance film based on a song by [[Nina Simone]]. It won a Gold Medal for Women in Film in the 1978 Miami International Film Festival. As a graduate student at [[UCLA]], she received an MFA in Film and Television Production. She directed the film ''Diary of an African Nun'' (1977). Screened at the Los Angeles Film Exposition, it earned a Director's Guild Award for a Student Film.<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu">[http://voices.cla.umn.edu/artistpages/dashJulie.php Voices: "Julie Dash"], University of Minnesota, 5 August 2005</ref>

==Marriage and family==
She married Arthur Jafa, a [[cinematographer]]. They had a daughter Nzinga and later separated. They worked together on her ''Daughters of the Dust'' (1992), which won numerous awards for cinematography.

==Career==

===Early career===
Her work began to take on a new direction after film school. Dash said in an interview with the ''[[Village Voice]]'',
<blockquote>"I stopped making documentaries after discovering [[Toni Morrison]], [[Toni Cade Bambara]], and [[Alice Walker]]. I wondered, why can't we see movies like this? I realized I needed to learn how to make narrative movies."</blockquote>Being inspired by the novels of black women authors led to her decision to work at dramatic films.

Her film ''[[Illusions by Julie Dash|Illusions]]'' (1982) was her first to earn more widespread success and attention.<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu"/> Set in 1942 [[Hollywood]], a year after the attack at [[Pearl Harbor]], it takes place at the fictional National Studios. Mignon Duprée is a black woman executive who has "[[passing (racial identity)|passed]]" for white to achieve her position. Ester Jeeter is a black woman who dubs the singing voice in musicals for a white Hollywood star. They work in an industry based on creating images and alternative realities. The film explores Mignon's dilemma, Ester's struggle to get roles as an actress/singer rather than dub for others, and the uses of cinema in wartime: three illusions in conflict with reality.<ref>[http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c300.shtml "Julie Dash: 'Illusions'"], Women Make Movies website</ref> The film has a major theme of the use of codes for strategic advantage. It also explores racial and sexual discrimination in Hollywood and American society.<ref>[http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/blogs/la-rebellion/2011/11/14/codes-and-closets-julie-dashs-illusions "CODES AND CLOSETS: JULIE DASH'S ILLUSIONS"], UCLA Film and Television Archive, 14 November 2011</ref>

''Illusions'' was critically acclaimed; it received the 1985 Black American Cinema Society Award and the Black Filmmaker Foundation's Jury Prize in 1989 as best film of the decade. Kevin Thomas of the ''[[LA Times]]'' described it as "a gripping critique of the power of the movies to shape perception", while exploring the illusions created by Hollywood, as well as the illusion of racial identity. The success of this film and other shorts enabled Dash to move to feature films.<ref name='LAT-BACS-1985'>{{cite news |title=Dash Tops List : Black Film Society To Give Awards |author= |first=Kevin |last=Thomas |authorlink= |authorlink2= |author2= |author3= |author4= |author5= |author6= |author7= |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-01-22/entertainment/ca-11130_1_black-film |format= |agency= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |publisher= |location=Los Angeles, California |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=1985-01-22 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=2011-11-05 |language= |trans_title= |quote=Film maker Julie Dash will be presented a $1,500 first prize on Feb. 1 at the third annual Black American Cinema Society awards at the Ambassador Hotel for "Illusions," a drama about a black female executive (played by ''The Cotton Club's'' Lonette McKee) passing for white at a Hollywood studio during World War II. |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |ref=}}</ref><ref name='LAR-Illusions'>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/events/2011-11-12/illusions-1982-fragrance-1991-above-so-below-1973-rain-1978|title=Illusions |first=Allyson Nadia |last=Field |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work= |publisher=UCLA Film and Television Archives |location=Los Angeles, California |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |format= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |embargo= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=2011-11-05 |quote=Set in Hollywood during WWII, Illusions tells the story of Mignon Duprée, a studio executive passing for white, and Ester Jeeter, an African American singer hired to dub the voice of a white movie star|ref= |separator= |postscript=}}</ref>

From 1978 to 1980, Dash worked as member of the Classifications and Ratings Administrations for the Motion Picture Association of America. She had a special assignment screening at the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] to review a screening of short films in the Marché du Cinema.

===''Daughters of the Dust''===
{{main|Daughters of the Dust}}
Dash worked on ''Daughters of the Dust'' since 1975, finally getting financing in 1988 from PBS so that she could proceed. It is the first feature film by an African-American woman to be distributed in the United States in theatrical release. It tells the story of three generations of [[Gullah]] women in the Peazant family on [[Saint Helena Island (South Carolina)|St. Helena Island]] in 1902, as the younger ones prepare to migrate to the North. It was filmed on the Sea Islands.

The film is narrated by the Unborn Child, carried by Eula, a married daughter of the Peazant family. Nana Peazant is the matriarch, and she talks of the ancestors; their first people on the island were brought as slaves centuries before. Two daughters have returned from the mainland: one is a [[missionary]] and the other a beautiful woman known as Yellow Mary (she is bright-skinned), who was "ruin't" by a white man and has become a prostitute. The family gathers for a last big dinner on the beach before the migration, which will leave Nana Peazant on the island. One of the daughters eloped with a Native American man on the island. Dash chose to have the dialogue in [[Gullah]], without subtitles, so that the audience would be immersed in its poetry.

The movie gained critical praise, for both its rich language and use of song, and for its lyrical visual imagery and cinematography. It won awards at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] and others. In 2004, ''Daughters of the Dust'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

With her success, Dash said,
<blockquote>"I'm a very hopeful person and I think we can accomplish a lot through film in the '90s. We're going to see a lot of film work done by black women who have different concerns than our brothers who make films [...] We have strong statements to make because we've been silenced for so long".<ref name="Smith">Patricia Smith: "A Daughter's Tale: Julie Dash finally gets to tell her story of Gullah life," ''The Boston Globe'', 15 March 1992</ref></blockquote>

===Later career===
Dash has pursued other film projects than features. She has directed videos with musical artists, including Raphael Saadiq with Tony, Toni, Tone; Keb ‘Mo, Peabo Bryson, Adriana Evans, and Sweet Honey in the Rock. Her video for [[Tracy Chapman]]’s “Give Me One Reason” was nominated for MTV’s Best Female Vocalist, 1996.<ref name="juliedash.tv"/>

She also wrote and directed an episode of ''Women'' for [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] Cable Network, as well as ''Sax Cantor Riff'', one of [[HBO]]’s ''Subway Stories'' for producers [[Jonathan Demme]] and [[Rosie Perez]].<ref name="juliedash.tv"/>

Films for television include ''Funny Valentines'' (1999), an account of a well-to-do black woman's retreat from a troubled New York marriage to the [[Deep South]] and her childhood past.<ref>[http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/reviews/306/ John Leonard, "'Funny Valentines' and 'Deep in My Heart'"], ''New York Magazine''</ref> Dash rote the screenplays and directed the television movies ''Incognito'' (1999), a romantic thriller made by BET Arabesque Films; and ''Love Song'' (2000), an MTV movie starring the Grammy award-winning singer [[Monica (entertainer)|Monica]].<ref name="voices.cla.umn.edu"/>

''[[The Rosa Parks Story]]'' (2002) is about a significant woman of the [[civil rights movement]], starring [[Angela Bassett]]. The film follows her life and her marriage to Raymond Parks ([[Peter Francis James]]) as they deal with the issues of segregation, [[Jim Crow]] and second-class status in 1950s [[Alabama]]. Rosa Parks is shown having to take a test and being rejected when she tries to register to vote; blacks were essentially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] in the South for more than 60 years. She becomes involved in the civil rights movement and her decision to keep her seat on the bus prompts the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], which lasted 381 days and caught national attention. Her case went to the Supreme Court. Shown on the CBS Network, ''The Rosa Parks Story'' won numerous awards.<ref name="juliedash.tv"/>

In 2004 Dash made ''Brothers of the Borderland'', a work commissioned by the [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]]. Narrated by [[Oprah Winfrey]], the film features the character of Alice, an escaped slave whose story represents an amalgamation of historic figures. The film is shown in the [[Harriet Tubman]] theater, named for the fugitive slave woman who helped many others escape to freedom.<ref>[http://likeawhisper.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/bhm-friday-directors-julie-dash/ "BHM: Friday Directors – Julie Dash"], Professor Sussuro blog, 13 February 2009</ref>
