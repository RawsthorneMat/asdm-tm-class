He is known for his dark, gothic, macabre, and quirky horror and fantasy films such as the horror comedy fantasy ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), the romantic dark fantasy ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), the musical fantasy-thriller ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993), the comedy-drama biopic ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), the fantasy adventure ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), the animated fantasy ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005), the musical horror film ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' (2007), the horror comedy ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'' (2012) and the animated horror comedy ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]'' (2012). He is also known for [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] such as the adventure comedy ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), the superhero films ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and its first sequel ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), the sci-fi film ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (2001), the musical adventure film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' (2005) and the fantasy film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (2010), which garnered a worldwide gross of over $1 billion worldwide, being Burton's most successful film to date.

Burton has worked repeatedly with [[Johnny Depp]], who has become a close friend of Burton since their first film together. He has also worked with musician [[Danny Elfman]], who has composed scores for all but two of the films Burton has directed. Actress [[Helena Bonham Carter]], Burton's former [[domestic partnership|domestic partner]], has appeared in many of his films. He also wrote and illustrated the poetry book ''[[The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories]]'', published in 1997, and a compilation of his drawings, sketches and other artwork, entitled ''The Art of Tim Burton'', was released in 2009.

==Early life==
Burton was born in 1958, in the city of [[Burbank, California]], to Jean Burton (née Erickson), the owner of a cat-themed gift shop, and Bill Burton, a former minor league baseball player who would later work for the Burbank Park and Recreation Department.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|last=Morgenstern |first=Joe |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/09/magazine/tim-burton-batman-and-the-joker.html?pagewanted=all |title=Tim Burton, Batman and The Joker |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=April 9, 1989 |accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article544489.ece?print=yes&randnum=1151003209000 | work=The Times | location=London | title=Tim+Burton | accessdate=May 25, 2010 | first=Sadie | last=Gray}}</ref> As a [[Preadolescence|preteen]], Burton would make short films in his backyard on Evergreen Street using crude [[stop motion]] animation techniques or shoot them on 8&nbsp;mm film without sound (one of his oldest known juvenile films is ''[[The Island of Doctor Agor]]'', that he made when he was 13 years old). Burton studied at [[Burbank High School (Burbank, California)|Burbank High School]], but he was not a particularly good student. He was a very introspective person, and found his pleasure in painting, drawing and watching films. His future work would be heavily influenced by the works of such childhood heroes as [[Dr. Seuss]] and [[Roald Dahl]].<ref>Alison McMahan (2005). [http://books.google.com/books?id=2J5-MMVW1pYC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=tim+burton+-+dr+seuss+roald+dahl&source=bl&ots=34ue9QkTq5&sig=Jl6GiydiHyec7IOikFD2GrrM7nY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DvfDT9v7NMjA0QXM443fCg&ved=0CF4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false "The Films of Tim Burton: Animating Live Action in Contemporary Hollywood"]. p.27. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005</ref> After graduating from Burbank High School with Jeff Riekenberg, Burton attended the [[California Institute of the Arts]] in [[Santa Clarita, California]], to study [[character animation]].<ref name=VFCal>{{cite news|last=Kashner|first=Sam|title=The Class That Roared|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2014/03/calarts-animation-1970s-tim-burton|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=Vanity Fair|year=2014}}</ref> As a student in CalArts, Burton made the shorts ''[[Stalk of the Celery Monster]]'' and ''King and Octopus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Jo6L9Qzpp0 |title=Tim Burton's early short: 'King and Octopus' Clip |publisher=YouTube |date=December 5, 2009 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}</ref> He graduated in 1979.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Early career: 1980s==
''Stalk of the Celery Monster'' attracted the attention of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions' animation department]], which offered Burton an animator's apprenticeship at the studio.<ref name=VFCal/> He worked as an animator, storyboard artist and [[concept art]]ist on films such as ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' (1981), ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' and ''[[Tron]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082406/news|title=The Fox and the Hound|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate = August 19, 2014}}</ref> However, Burton's personal style clashed with Disney's standards, and he longed to work on solo projects.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

While at Disney in 1982, Burton made his first short, ''[[Vincent (1982 film)|Vincent]]'', a six-minute black-and-white [[stop motion]] film based on a poem written by the filmmaker, and depicting a young boy who fantasizes that he is his hero [[Vincent Price]], with Price himself providing narration. The film was produced by [[Rick Heinrichs]], whom Burton had befriended while working in the concept art department at Disney. The film was shown at the Chicago Film Festival and released, alongside the teen drama ''[[Tex (film)|Tex]]'', for two weeks in one Los Angeles cinema. This was followed by Burton's first live-action production ''[[Hansel and Gretel (1982 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]'', a Japanese-themed adaptation of the [[Brothers Grimm]] [[Hansel and Gretel|fairy tale]] for the [[Disney Channel]], which climaxes in a [[kung fu]] fight between Hansel and Gretel and the witch. Having aired once at 10:30 pm on Halloween 1983 and promptly shelved, prints of the film are extremely difficult to locate, fueling rumors that the project did not exist. The short would finally go on public display in 2009 at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], and again in 2011 as part of the Tim Burton art exhibit at [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]].

Burton's next live-action short, ''[[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|Frankenweenie]]'', was released in 1984. It tells the story of a young boy who tries to revive his dog after it is run over by a car. Filmed in black-and-white, it stars [[Barret Oliver]], [[Shelley Duvall]] (with whom he would work again in 1986, directing an episode of her ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'') and [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]]. After ''Frankenweenie'' was completed, Disney fired Burton, under the pretext of him spending the company's resources on doing a film that would be too dark and scary for children to see.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-editors/tim-burton-disney-fired-181740632.html|title=Tim Burton: How Disney fired me|author=Edward Bovingdon |publisher=[[Yahoo! Inc.]] |date = October 18, 2012}}</ref>

Pursuing then an opportunity to make a full-length film, he was approached by [[Griffin Dunne]] to direct the [[black comedy]] film ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]''. However, after [[Martin Scorsese]]'s project ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' was cancelled (though later completed and released in 1988), Scorsese showed an interest in directing ''After Hours''. Respectfully, Burton bowed out.

===''Pee-wee's Big Adventure''===
{{Main|Pee-wee's Big Adventure}}
Not long after, actor [[Paul Reubens]] saw ''Vincent'' and ''Frankenweenie'' and chose Burton to direct the cinematic spin-off of his popular character [[Pee-wee Herman]]. Pee-wee Herman gained mainstream popularity with a successful stage show at [[The Groundlings]] and then [[the Roxy]] which was later turned into an [[The Pee-wee Herman Show|HBO special]]. The film, ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'', was made on a budget of $8&nbsp;million and grossed more than $40&nbsp;million at the box office. Burton, a fan of the eccentric musical group [[Oingo Boingo]], asked songwriter [[Danny Elfman]] to provide the music for the film. Since then, Elfman has scored every film that Tim Burton has directed except for ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (because of a falling out that they had<ref>{{cite web|last=Calamar|first=Gary|title=Danny Elfman|url=http://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/or/or050828danny_elfman|work=The Open Road|publisher=KCRW}}</ref>) and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' because the music was based on [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s musical.

===''Beetlejuice''===
{{Main|Beetlejuice}}
After directing episodes for the [[Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985 TV series)|revitalized version]] of '50s/'60s anthology horror series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' and [[Shelley Duvall]]'s ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', Burton received his next big project: ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), a supernatural [[comedy horror]] about a young couple forced to cope with life after death, and the family of pretentious yuppies who invade their treasured New England home. Their teenage daughter Lydia ([[Winona Ryder]]) has an obsession with death which allows her to see the deceased couple. Starring [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Geena Davis]], and featuring [[Michael Keaton]] as the obnoxious bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, the film grossed $80&nbsp;million on a relatively low budget and won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]]. It would be converted into a [[Beetlejuice (TV series)|cartoon of the same name]], with Burton playing a role as executive producer, that ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and later [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]].

===''Batman''===
{{Main|Batman (1989 film)}}
Burton's ability to produce hits with low budgets impressed studio executives, and he received his first big budget film, ''Batman''. The production was plagued with problems. Burton repeatedly clashed with the film's producers, [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]], but the most notable debacle involved casting. For the title role, Burton chose to cast Michael Keaton as [[Batman]] following their previous collaboration in ''Beetlejuice'', despite Keaton's average physique, inexperience with action films, and reputation as a comic actor. Although Burton won in the end, the furor over the casting provoked enormous fan animosity, to the extent that Warner Brothers' share price slumped.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Burton had considered it ridiculous to cast a "bulked-up" ultra-masculine man as Batman, insisting that the Caped Crusader should be an ordinary (albeit fabulously wealthy) man who dressed up in an elaborate bat costume to frighten criminals. Burton cast [[Jack Nicholson]] as [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] ([[Tim Curry]] being his second choice) in a move that helped assuage fans' fears, as well as attracting older audiences not as interested in a [[superhero film]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

When the film opened in June 1989, it was backed by the biggest marketing and merchandising campaign in film history at the time, and became one of the biggest box office hits of all time, grossing well over US$250&nbsp;million in the US alone and $400&nbsp;million worldwide (numbers not adjusted for inflation) and earning critical acclaim for the performances of both Keaton and Nicholson, as well as the film's production aspects, which won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]]. The success of the film helped establish Burton as a profitable director, and it also proved to be a huge influence on future superhero films, which eschewed the bright, all-American heroism of [[Richard Donner]]'s ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' for a grimmer, more realistic look and characters with more psychological depth. It also became a major inspiration for the successful 1990s cartoon ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', in as much as the darkness of the picture and its sequel allowed for a darker Batman on television.

Burton claimed that the graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' was a major influence on his film adaptation of ''Batman'':
<blockquote>"I was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan&nbsp;– and I think it started when I was a child&nbsp;– is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't know if it was [[dyslexia]] or whatever, but that's why I loved ''The Killing Joke'', because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable."<ref>Tim Burton, ''Burton on Burton: Revised Edition'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 71.</ref></blockquote>

==1990s==

===''Edward Scissorhands''===
{{Main|Edward Scissorhands}}
In 1990, Burton co-wrote (with [[Caroline Thompson]]) and directed ''Edward Scissorhands'', re-uniting with Winona Ryder from ''Beetlejuice''. His friend [[Johnny Depp]], a teen idol at the end of the 1980s due primarily to his work on the hit TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'', was cast in the title role of Edward, who was the creation of an eccentric and old-fashioned inventor (played by [[Vincent Price]] in one of his last screen appearances). Edward looked human, but was left with scissors in the place of hands due to the untimely death of his creator. Set in suburbia (and shot in [[Lakeland, Florida]]), the film is largely seen as Burton's autobiography of his childhood in Burbank. Depp wrote a similar comment in the foreword to Mark Salisbury's book, ''Burton on Burton'', regarding his first meeting with Burton over the casting of the film. ''Edward'' is considered one of Burton's best movies by some critics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Biodrowski |first=Steve |url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2000/10/edward-scissorhands-tim-burtons-elephant-man/ |title=Edward Scissorhands&nbsp;– Film & DVD Review |publisher=Cinefantastique Online |date=October 24, 2000 |accessdate=June 12, 2012}}</ref> Following this collaboration with Burton, Depp starred in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Corpse Bride]]'', ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'', ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', and ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]''.

In 2004, [[Matthew Bourne]] came to Burton with the idea to turn the story of Edward into a ballet. In 2005, the ballet first aired. It has now toured the UK, the US, Canada, Australia and parts of Europe.

===''Batman Returns''===
{{Main|Batman Returns}}
The day Warner Brothers declined to make the more personal ''Scissorhands'' even after the success of ''Batman'', Burton finally agreed to direct the sequel for Warner Brothers on the condition that he would be granted total control. The result was ''Batman Returns''
which featured Michael Keaton returning as the Dark Knight, and a new triad of villains: [[Danny DeVito]] (as [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]]), [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] (as [[Catwoman]]) and [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Max Shreck]], an evil corporate tycoon and original character created for the film (similar to ''[[Superman III]]''{{'}}s [[Ross Webster]]). Darker and considerably more personal than its predecessor, concerns were raised that the film was too scary for children. Audiences were even more uncomfortable at the film's overt sexuality, personified by the sleek, fetish-inspired styling of Catwoman's costume. One critic remarked, "too many villains spoiled the Batman", highlighting Burton's decision to focus the storyline more on the villains instead of Batman. The film also polarized the fanbase, with some loving the darkness and quirkiness, while others felt it was not true to the core aspects of the source material. Burton made many changes to the Penguin which would subsequently be applied to the character in both comics and television. While in the comics, he was an ordinary man, Burton created a freak of nature resembling a penguin with webbed, flipper-like fingers, a hooked, beak-like nose, and a penguin-like body (resulting in a rotund, obese man). Released in 1992, ''Batman Returns'' grossed $282.8&nbsp;million worldwide, making it another financial success, though not to the extent of its predecessor.

===''The Nightmare Before Christmas''===
{{Main|The Nightmare Before Christmas}}
Next, Burton wrote and produced (but did not direct, due to schedule constraints on ''Batman Returns'') ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' (1993) for Disney, originally meant to be a children's book in rhyme. The film was directed by [[Henry Selick]] and written by [[Caroline Thompson]], based on Burton's original story, world and characters. The film received positive reviews for the film's stop motion animation, musical score and original storyline and was a box office success, grossing $50&nbsp;million. Burton collaborated with Selick again for ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' (1996), which Burton co-produced. The film helped to generate a renewed interest in stop motion animation.

===''Cabin Boy''===
{{Main|Cabin Boy}}
In 1994, Burton and frequent co-producer [[Denise Di Novi]] produced the 1994 fantasy-comedy ''Cabin Boy'', starring comedian [[Chris Elliott]] and directed/written by [[Adam Resnick]]. Burton was originally supposed to direct the film after seeing Elliott perform on ''[[Get a Life (TV series)|Get a Life]]'', but handed the directing responsibility to Resnick once he was offered ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''. The film was almost entirely panned by critics, even earning Chris Elliott a 1995 [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Award]] for "Worst New Star".<ref>{{IMDb title|109361|section=awards|Cabin Boy}}</ref> The film also has a 45% "rotten" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], indicating more mixed contemporary reviews.

===''Ed Wood''===
{{Main|Ed Wood (film)}}
His next film, ''Ed Wood'' (1994), was of a much smaller scale, depicting the life of [[Ed Wood]], a filmmaker sometimes called "the worst director of all time". Starring Johnny Depp in the title role, the film is an homage to the low-budget science fiction and horror films of Burton's childhood, and handles its comical protagonist and his motley band of collaborators with surprising fondness and sensitivity. Owing to creative squabbles during the making of ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'', Danny Elfman declined to score ''Ed Wood'', and the assignment went to [[Howard Shore]]. While a commercial failure at the time of its release, ''Ed Wood'' was well received by critics. [[Martin Landau]] received an Academy Award in the Best Supporting Actor category for his portrayal of [[Bela Lugosi]], and the film received the award for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]].

===''Batman Forever''===
{{Main|Batman Forever}}

Despite Burton's intention to still lead the ''Batman'' franchise, Warner Bros. considered ''Batman Returns'' too dark and unsafe for children. To attract the young audience, it was decided that [[Joel Schumacher]], who had directed films like ''[[The Client (1994 film)|The Client]]'', lead the third film, while Burton would only produce it in conjunction with [[Peter MacGregor-Scott]]. Following this change and the changes made by the new director, Michael Keaton resigned from the lead role and was replaced by [[Val Kilmer]]. Filming began in late 1994 with new actors: [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, [[Nicole Kidman]] as Dr. Chase Meridian, [[Chris O'Donnell]] as Dick Grayson/Robin and [[Jim Carrey]] as Edward Nygma/ The Riddler; the only two actors who returned were [[Pat Hingle]] as Commissioner Gordon and [[Michael Gough]] as Alfred Pennyworth. The film, a combination of the darkness that characterized the saga and colors and neon signs proposed by Schumacher, was a huge box office success, earning $336&nbsp;million, in spite of the controversy over the characters and plot. Warner Bros. demanded that Schumacher delete some scenes so the film did not have the same tone as its predecessor, ''Batman Returns'' (later they were added as deleted scenes on the 2005 DVD release). Schumacher was rehired to lead another sequel, the infamous ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', in which Burton, for unknown reasons, did not participate.

===''James and the Giant Peach''===
{{Main|James and the Giant Peach (film)}}
In 1996, Burton and Selick reunited for the musical fantasy ''James and the Giant Peach'', based on the book by [[Roald Dahl]]. The film, a combination of live action and stop motion footage, starred [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Simon Callow]] and [[Jane Leeves]] among others, with Burton producing and Selick directing. The film was mostly praised by critics, and was nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Musical or Comedy Score]] (by [[Randy Newman]]).

===''Mars Attacks!''===
{{Main|Mars Attacks!}}
Elfman and Burton reunited for ''Mars Attacks!'' (1996). Based on a popular science fiction trading card series, the film was a hybrid of 1950s science fiction and 1970s all-star disaster films. Coincidence made it an inadvertent spoof of the blockbuster ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', which had been released five months earlier. The film boasted an all-star cast, including [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Sarah Jessica Parker]], [[Natalie Portman]], [[Lukas Haas]], [[Martin Short]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Christina Applegate]] and [[Jack Black]].

===''Superman Lives''===
{{Main|Superman in film#Superman Lives}}
After [[Kevin Smith]] had been hired to write a new ''Superman'' film, he suggested Burton to direct.<ref name=Gross2>{{cite news | author = Edward Gross | title = ''SUPERMAN LIVES'', Part 2: Writer Kevin Smith | work = Mania Movies |url=http://www.mania.com/21118.html | date = May 12, 2000 | accessdate = February 3, 2008}}</ref> Burton came on and Warner Bros. set a theatrical release date for the summer of 1998, the 60th anniversary of the character's debut in ''[[Action Comics]]''.<ref name=forever>{{cite book | author = Ken Hanke | title = Tim Burton: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Renaissance Books]] | pages = 213–8 | isbn = 1-58063-162-2}}</ref> [[Nicolas Cage]] was signed on to play Superman, Burton hired [[Wesley Strick]] to rewrite Smith's script and the film entered pre-production in June 1997. For budgetary reasons, Warner Bros. ordered another rewrite from [[Dan Gilroy]], delayed the film and ultimately put it on hold in April 1998. Burton then left to direct ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]''.<ref name=forever/> Burton has depicted the experience as a difficult one, citing differences with producer [[Jon Peters]] and the studio, stating, "I basically wasted a year. A year is a long time to be working with somebody that you don't really want to be working with."<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul A. Woods|title=Tim Burton: A Child's Garden of Nightmares|year=2007|publisher= Plexus Publishing|page=150|isbn=0-85965-401-X}}</ref>

===''Sleepy Hollow''===
{{Main|Sleepy Hollow (film)}}
''Sleepy Hollow'', released in late 1999, had a supernatural setting and contained another offbeat performance by Johnny Depp as [[Ichabod Crane]], now a detective with an interest in forensic science rather than the schoolteacher of [[Washington Irving]]'s original tale. With ''Hollow'', Burton paid homage to the horror films of the English company [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]]. [[Christopher Lee]], one of Hammer's stars, was given a cameo role. A host of Burton regulars appeared in supporting roles ([[Michael Gough]], [[Jeffrey Jones]] and [[Christopher Walken]], among others) and [[Christina Ricci]] was cast as Katrina van Tassel. A well-regarded supporting cast was headed by [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Michael Gambon]], [[Richard Griffiths]] and [[Ian McDiarmid]]. Mostly well received by critics, and with a special mention to Elfman's Gothic score, the film won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]], as well as two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]s for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design. A box office success, ''Sleepy Hollow'' was also a turning point for Burton. Along with change in his personal life (separation from actress [[Lisa Marie (actress)|Lisa Marie]]), Burton changed radically in style for his next project, leaving the haunted forests and colorful outcasts behind to go on to directing ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' which, as Burton had repeatedly noted, was "not a remake" of the earlier film.

===''Planet of the Apes''===
{{Main|Planet of the Apes (2001 film)}}
''Planet of the Apes'' was a commercial success, grossing $68&nbsp;million in its opening weekend. The film has received mixed reviews and is widely considered inferior to [[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|the first adaptation]] of [[Planet of the Apes (novel)|the novel]].

===''Big Fish''===
{{Main|Big Fish}}
In 2003, Burton directed ''Big Fish'', based on the novel ''[[Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions]]'' by [[Daniel Wallace (author)|Daniel Wallace]]. The film is about a father telling the story of his life to his son using exaggeration and color. Starring [[Ewan McGregor]] as young Edward Bloom and [[Albert Finney]] as an older Edward Bloom, the film also stars [[Jessica Lange]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Alison Lohman]] and [[Marion Cotillard]]. ''Big Fish'' is also notable as [[Miley Cyrus]]' first film—she plays "Young Ruthie" credited under her birth name, [[Destiny Hope Cyrus]]. ''Big Fish'' received four [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nominations as well as an Academy Award nomination for Elfman's score. ''Big Fish'' was also the second collaboration between Burton and [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who played the characters of Jenny and the Witch.

===''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory''===
[[File:Tim Burton CATCF premiere 2005 (cropped).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Burton at premiere of the film in 2005.]]
{{Main|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)}}
''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' (2005) is an adaptation of the [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory|book of the same name]] by [[Roald Dahl]]. Starring Johnny Depp as [[Willy Wonka]], [[Freddie Highmore]] as [[Charlie Bucket]] and [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as Mrs. Bucket, the film generally took a more faithful approach to the source material than the 1971 adaptation, ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', although some liberties were taken, such as adding Wonka's issue with his father (played by [[Christopher Lee]]). ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was later nominated for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]. The film made over $207&nbsp;million domestically. Filming proved difficult as Burton, Depp, and Danny Elfman had to work on this and Burton's ''Corpse Bride'' at the same time.

===''Dark Shadows''===
{{Main|Dark Shadows (film)}}
Burton's film ''Dark Shadows'' once again starred [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Helena Bonham Carter]] in leading roles.

[[Danny Elfman]] once again composed and conducted the score and soundtrack for the film, and Colleen Atwood was the costume designer. It has received mixed reviews from critics, some of whom think it is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] gothic comedy, visually appealing and fitting as an adaptation of the melodramatic soap opera, whereas others think the film has a very loose plot, is not particularly humorous, and that Burton and Depp's collaborative efforts have worn thin. Depp's performance has also had a mixed reception, with some claiming that his performance is the best thing about the film, while others have accused him of overacting.
