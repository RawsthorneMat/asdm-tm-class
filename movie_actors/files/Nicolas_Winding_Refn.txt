He moved to the United States in 1981 and is known for directing the [[Pusher (film series)|''Pusher'' films]] (1996, 2004, 2005),<ref>{{cite web|title=THE PUSHER TRILOGY|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003019199|work=Film Journal International|publisher=Film Journal International|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Ethan Alter|year=2012}}</ref> ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (2011) and ''[[Only God Forgives]]'' (2013). In 2008 Refn co-founded the Copenhagen-based production company [[Space Rocket Nation]].<ref>[http://www.spacerocketnation.com]</ref>

==Early life==
Winding Refn was born in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], and raised partly in [[New York]], United States.<ref>Lim Dennis (October 01, 2009).

Winding Refn has cited viewing ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) as inspiration for his filmmaking career:
{{Quote|I grew up in a cinema family. My parents were brought up on the [[French New Wave]]. That was God to them, but to me it was the antichrist, and how better to rebel against your parents than by watching something your mother is going to hate, which were American horror movies. When I saw ''Texas Chain Saw Massacre'', I realized: I don't want to be a [[Film director|director]], I don't want to be a [[Screenwriter|writer]], I don't want to be a [[Film producer|producer]], I don't want to be a [[Cinematographer|photographer]], I don't want to be an [[Film editor|editor]], I don't want to be a [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound man]]. I want to be all of them at once. And that film proved that you can do it because that movie is not a normal movie.<ref name="Foundas">{{cite web|last=Foundas|first=Scott|title=Anger Management|url=http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/1203-Summer-2012/Independent-Voice-Nicolas-Winding-Refn.aspx|work=DGA Quarterly|accessdate=August 22, 2012|date=Summer 2012}}</ref> }}

He attended the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] but was expelled for throwing a chair into a wall.<ref name=BE/>

==Career==

===The ''Pusher'' trilogy===
Winding Refn made his directorial debut with the Danish crime drama film ''[[Pusher (1996 film)|Pusher]]'' (1996). The original film garnered a Best Supporting Actor Award at the 1997 [[Bodil Awards]]. Refn later made two sequels, ''[[Pusher II]]'' (2004) (aka Pusher II: With Blood on My Hands) and ''[[Pusher 3]]'' (2005) (aka Pusher III: I'm The Angel of Death). For ''[[Pusher II]]'', lead actor [[Mads Mikkelsen]] won a Best Actor at the 2005 [[Bodil Awards]], Best Actor at the 2005 Robert Festival (where the film was also nominated for Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Film, among other nominations) and Best Actor at the 2005 Zulu Awards. The film was remade into a British version in 2012, ''[[Pusher (2012 film)|Pusher]]'', directed by [[Luis Prieto (director)|Luis Prieto]] and executive produced by Refn himself.

===''Bleeder''===
In 1999, Refn directed the crime-drama-thriller ''[[Bleeder (film)|Bleeder]]'' (1999), which featured much of the same cast from the ''Pusher'' Trilogy, including actors such as Kim Bodnia and [[Mads Mikkelsen]]. Refn won the [[FIPRESCI]] prize for the film at the 2000 [[Sarajevo Film Festival]], and the film also won Best Lighting at the Robert Festival, and was nominated for Best Film and Best Supporting Actress at the 2000 [[Bodil Awards]], as well as for the Grand Prix Asturias for Best Feature at the 1999 [[Gijon International Film Festival]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===''Fear X''===
In 2003, Refn directed and wrote his first English-language film, ''[[Fear X]]'', which starred [[John Turturro]] and was shot in Canada. Although being a commercial failure that bankrupted the film company (Jang Go Star) at the time, the Danish-Canadian production won an International Fantasy Film Award for Best Screenplay at the 2004 [[Fantasporto]] Film Festival, and was nominated for best actor awards (for Turturro) at the [[Bodil Awards]] and the [[Fangoria]] Awards, and best film awards at festivals including [[Sitges Film Festival]] and the [[Kinotavr|Sochi International Film Festival]].

===''Bronson''===
In 2008, Refn returned to the European art house film circuit after his unsuccessful Hollywood venture ''[[Fear X]]'' (his first Hollywood success would be ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]''), and directed and wrote ''[[Bronson (film)|Bronson]]'' (2008), which starred [[Tom Hardy]] as the title character, the infamous real-life U.K. prisoner [[Charles Bronson (prisoner)|Charles Bronson]]. The film won Best Film at the 2009 [[Sydney Film Festival]], and was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize (World Cinema&nbsp;— Dramatic) at the 2009 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. Hardy also won a Best Actor award at the 2009 [[British Independent Film Awards]] for his portrayal of Charles Bronson (and the film was also nominated for a Best Achievement in Production award as well). Hardy was also nominated for Best Actor from the [[Evening Standard British Film Awards]] and the [[London Critics Circle Film Awards]].

===''Valhalla Rising''===
In 2009, Refn teamed up again with frequent collaborator [[Mads Mikkelsen]] to write and direct ''[[Valhalla Rising (film)|Valhalla Rising]]'', a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] period piece about the brutal Viking era. The film won an International Fantasy Film Special Jury Award and Special Mention at the 2010 [[Fantasporto]] Festival, and won the Titra Film Award for Refn at the 2010 [[Neuchatel International Fantastic Film Festival]]. The film also won a Best Make-Up award at the 2011 Robert Festival.

===''Drive''===
[[File:Nicolas Winding Refn Deauville 2011.jpg|thumb|Winding Refn promoting ''Drive'' at the [[Deauville American Film Festival]] in September 2011.]]
In 2011, Winding Refn directed the American neo-noir crime drama ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' (2011). It premiered in competition at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]], where he received the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director Award]].<ref name="Cannes">{{cite web|title=OFFICIAL SELECTION 2011|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/58041.html|work=Festival de Cannes|publisher=Festival de Cannes|accessdate=29 July 2012|author=Festival de Cannes|year=2011}}</ref>

Refn may produce (or direct, which is less likely) a prequel to the 80s cult film ''[[Maniac Cop]]''.<ref>Screenrant, Nucholas Winding Refn and Maniac Cop Prequel, [http://screenrant.com/nicolas-winding-refn-manic-cop-prequel-mlee-165924/ Screenrant.com]</ref>

He will also direct a live action adaptation of [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s comic book series ''[[The Incal]]''.<ref>[http://screenrant.com/the-incal-movie-nicolas-winding-refn/ Screenrant.com]</ref>

He has expressed interest in the British science-fiction series, [[Doctor Who]], saying “I would have loved to direct Doctor Who but they didn’t want me — they turned me down last year. Maybe if they revive [[Blakes 7]] (another BBC sci-fi) I could do that. I love it. It’s great. That could be fun to update.” <ref>[http://screenrant.com/drive-2-logans-run-nicolas-winding-refn-benm-148533// Screenrant.com]</ref>

===Unrealized projects===
In 2009, Winding Refn was attached to direct a modern retelling of ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' with [[Keanu Reeves]] playing the titular roles.  The working title of the film was ''Jekyll''.  According to an interview with SciFi Wire, he wanted the film to take place "in modern America and use as much credible science as possible."<ref>{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Russ|title=Nicolas Winding Refn Talks Valhalla Rising and Jekyll|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/nicolas-winding-refn-talks-valhalla-rising-and-jekyll/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>  However in February 2010, Winding Refn dropped out of the project in order to work on ''Drive''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fischer|first=Russ|title=Nicolas Winding Refn Off Both Jekyll and The Dying of the Light|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/nicolas-winding-refn-off-both-jekyll-and-the-dying-of-the-light/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>

In 2010, Winding Refn was attached to direct [[Paul Schrader]]'s script ''The Dying of the Light'' with [[Harrison Ford]] as the lead.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dang|first=Simon|title=Harrison Ford To Lead Nicolas Winding Refn's The Dying of the Light'?|url=http://theplaylist.blogspot.com/2010/01/harrison-ford-to-lead-nicolas-winding.html|publisher=The Playlist|accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>  However, in February 2010, Winding Refn exited the project. In September 2011 during promotion for ''Drive'', he claimed that Ford did not want his character to die, causing the film production to fall apart.<ref>{{cite web|last=Everett|first=Cory|title=Nicolas Winding Refn Says 'Dying Of The Light' Fell Apart Because Harrison Ford Didn't Want To Die|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/nicolas_winding_refn_said_dying_of_the_light_fell_apart_because_harrison_fo|publisher=Indiewire|accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>

[[Channing Tatum]], who was to co-star with Ford in ''The Dying of the Light'', originally wanted Winding Refn to direct ''[[Magic Mike]]'' (2012), which [[Steven Soderbergh]] came to direct.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|title=Nicolas Winding Refn Was Originally In Talks To Direct 'Magic Mike'; Steven Soderbergh Has No Desire To Make Another "Important Movie"|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/nicolas-winding-refn-was-originally-in-talks-to-direct-magic-mike-steven-soderbergh-has-no-desire-to-make-another-important-movie-20120626|publisher=Indiewire|accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, Refn was attached to direct a remake of the 1980s crime show ''[[The Equalizer]]'' with [[Denzel Washington]] in the lead role, but the deal did not materialize with Sony for unknown reasons.<ref>{{cite web|work=Collider|title=Exclusive: Nicolas Winding Refn Will Not Direct THE EQUALIZER; Sony Looking for Other Directors to Begin Shooting in May|first=Matt|last=Goldberg|url=http://collider.com/nicolas-winding-refn-the-equalizer/}}</ref> The adaptation ''[[The Equalizer (film)|The Equalizer]]'' ended up being directed by [[Antoine Fuqua]] for release in 2014.

==Directing style==
Winding Refn has spoken about [[characterization]] in his films:
{{Quote|I've always liked characters that because of the circumstances, have to transform themselves, and in the end, it's inevitable that what they end up becoming is what they were meant to be. Take, for example, ''Pusher II'', which is a movie about a son [played by Mads Mikkelsen] who all his life wants his father's love, but realizes he needs to kill him to free the sins of the father from him. What plants the seed for him is realizing he has his own child, and the responsibility of that suddenly forces him to take action. And it's a happy ending, even though it's a dark ending, but for the character, it is what he was meant to become. It's almost like he achieved his true meaning. And ''Drive'' is similar in the sense that The Driver was meant to become a superhero, and he's denied all these things—relationships, companionship. And why would he be denied that? It was because he was meant for something greater.<ref name="Tobias">{{cite web|last=Tobias|first=Scott|title=Nicolas Winding Refn|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/nicolas-winding-refn,61788/|work=The A.V. Club|accessdate=August 22, 2012|date=September 15, 2011}}</ref> }}
Winding Refn prefers to shoot his films in chronological order: "I read that [director [[John Cassavetes]]] had done it on some of his films, so I thought, 'That's a pretty cool approach.' And after I did it on my first movie, I felt, 'How can you do a movie any other way?' It's like a painting—you paint the movie as you go along, and I like the uncertainty of not knowing exactly how it's going to turn out."<ref name="Foundas"/>  Winding Refn spoke more about shooting in chronological order in September 2011, in reference to ''Drive'':
{{Quote|It's always difficult with production. All my films previous to ''Drive'' had been shot in what I call 100-percent almost-chronological order. Where ''Drive'' is like 80 percent. The reason why it didn't go 100 was that I just simply couldn't afford the last remaining pieces. I could afford what I call "the emotional chronological order". So nobody would die or leave the movie in the middle of their shooting schedule. It would always be the end. So there was a build-up as much as possible.<ref name="Tobias"/> }}
On his approach to working with actors, Winding Refn has said:
{{Quote|I think the first thing I ask any actor is what they would like to do, which sometimes can frighten people or can be looked upon as, 'Oh, you don't know what you want.'  But I try to draw the actor in—to force them in, in some cases, because a lot of actors don't want to discuss things or go in deep; they just want to come and do the work, play their part and walk away. But for me, it doesn't work like that. You've got to get absorbed and dirty, and a way to do that is to ask the actor what they would like to do. It also forces them to be more truthful.<ref name="Foundas"/> }}
Winding Refn's [[color blindness]] has influenced his style: "I can't see mid-colors. That's why all my films are very contrasted, if it were anything else I couldn't see it."<ref name=BE>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Julia|title=Nicolas Winding Refn, Director of "Drive": Interview on The Sound of Young America|url=http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/nicolas-winding-refn-director-drive-interview-sound-young-america|work=Bullseye with Jesse Thorn|accessdate=August 22, 2012|date=September 12, 2011}}</ref>

Jodorowsky's Influence:

{{Quote|I had been seeing [[Jodorowsky]] the last couple years in Paris and we’d become quite close. Before we’d have dinner, we’d always have a tarot reading and talk about what it means. I feel that as a filmmaker, he’s the last of the great giants of an era that’s coming to a close. A year ago, he baptized me as his spiritual son and I wanted to reward that gesture.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Logan|last=Hill|title=Nicholas Winding Refn on Being One With Ryan Gosling|date=2013-05-16|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/cannes-film-festival-nicolas-winding-refn-on-being-one-with-ryan-gosling/}}</ref>}}

After making the movie ''Fear X'', Refn was heavily in debt. The story of Refn's recovery is recorded in the documentary ''Gambler'', directed by Phie Ambo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sneersnipe.co.uk/review_title.php?id=149|title=Gambler|year=2006|work=Sneersnipe.co.uk}}</ref>

After Lars von Trier's controversial remarks on the 2011 Cannes Film festival, Winding Refn apologised for Trier's behaviour on the behalf of Denmark.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TeOqrJHnpU YouTube]</ref>

Refn's wife, Liv Corfixen, wrote and directed a documentary entitled ''My Life Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn'', which chronicles the "behind the scenes" experience of shooting ''[[Only God Forgives]]'' when the entire family had to be relocated to Thailand. The documentary has received positive reviews after premiering at [[Fantastic Fest]] and Beyond Fest.<ref>Eric Kohn, Review: 'My Life Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn' Reveals the Sad Story Behind 'Only God Forgives', http://www.indiewire.com/article/review-my-life-directed-by-nicolas-winding-refn-reveals-the-sad-story-behind-only-god-forgives-20140923</ref> The soundtrack for the documentary is also composed entirely by [[Cliff Martinez]], with the last track "Disconnected" composed, written and sung by Julian Winding, Refn's nephew.
