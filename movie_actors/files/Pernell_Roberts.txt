==Early life==
Roberts was born in 1928 in [[North Carolina]] and moved to [[Waycross, Georgia]] as an infant, the only child of Pernell Elven Roberts, Sr. (1907–1980), a [[Dr Pepper]] salesman, and Minnie (Betty) Myrtle Morgan Roberts (1910–1988).
During his high school years, Pernell played the horn, acted in school and church plays and sang in local [[USO]] shows. He attended, but did not graduate from, [[Georgia Tech]]. Enlisting in 1946, he served for two years in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. He played the [[tuba]] and horn in the [[Marine Corps Band]], and he was also skilled at playing the [[sousaphone]] and [[percussion]].<ref name="NYT01"/> He later attended, also without graduating, the [[University of Maryland]], where he had his first exposure to acting in classical theatre. He appeared in four productions while a student, including ''[[Othello]]'' and [[Antigone (Sophocles)|''Antigone'']], but left school to act in [[summer stock]].

In 1949, he made his professional stage debut with [[Moss Hart]] and [[Kitty Carlisle]] in ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'' at the [[Olney Theatre]] in [[Olney, Maryland]]. Later, he spent eight weeks at the [[Bryn Mawr College]] Theatre in [[Philadelphia]], portraying Dan in [[Emlyn Williams]]' ''[[Night Must Fall]]'' and Alfred Doolittle in [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]]'s [[Pygmalion (play)|''Pygmalion'']].<ref>''Washington Post'' Sept. 24, 1950 Page L2</ref>

Roberts moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1950 and supported himself with a variety of jobs while performing with the [[Arena Stage]] Theater for two years. He performed in numerous productions, including Steinbeck's ''Burning Bright, The Adding Machine, The Firebrand, The Deletable Judge, The Taming of the Shrew'' ("Petruchio"), ''Playboy of the Western World, Children of Darkness, School for Wives, The Inspector General, The Glass Menagerie, Mr. Arcularis, Twelfth Night, The Scarecrow, The Importance of Being Earnest, Julius Caesar, She Stoops to Conquer, School for Scandal, Three Men on a Horse, Faith of Our Fathers'' (Sesquicentennial Amphitheatre) and ''Dark of the Moon''.

He performed with the Port Players, in [[Milwaukee]], in the comedy ''To Dorothy a Son,'' and other productions. "Roberts again is master of all situations, as he has been in the 9 previous productions of the season".<ref>Christopher Matthew, "Players Give Comedy Well", ''The Milwaukee Journal'', 1953{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>

He performed with the [[Brattle Theatre]]'s production of ''Othello'' and ''[[Henry IV Part I]]'', which was later brought to the New York City Center (''Playbill'', January 1957) and later, ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'' with the Cohassett Music Circus.<ref>Adrian Slifka, "Pernel Roberts Set To Portray Surgeon in New Comedy Drama", ''Youngstown Vindicator'', June 19, 1979, Pg.16</ref>

In 1952 he moved to [[New York City]], where he appeared first [[off-Broadway]] in one-act [[opera]]s and [[ballet]]s with the North American [[Lyric Theatre (1903 New York City)|Lyric Theatre]], with the Shakespearewrights, at the [[Equity Library Theatre]], and later on Broadway with performances in ''Tonight in Samarkand'' (also in Washington, D.C.) ''The Lovers'' opposite [[Joanne Woodward]], and ''A Clearing in the Woods'' with [[Robert Culp]] and Kim Stanley. He won a Drama Desk Award in 1955 for his performance in an off-Broadway rendition of ''Macbeth'', which was followed by the role of Mercutio in ''Romeo and Juliet''. He performed in ''Twelfth Night, Merchant of Venice, Dr. Faustus, The Taming of the Shrew'' at the American Shakespeare Festival, and later on Broadway. He performed in ''[[St. Joan]]'' (1954, Cleveland), ''Down in the Valley'' (at the Provincetown Playhouse), ''The Duchess of Malfi,  ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' and ''King John.'' .

In 1956, he returned to the [[Olney Theatre]], starring opposite Jan Farrand in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' with the "Players, Inc. Group".<ref>Richard L. Coe, "Big Season On For Shakespeare", ''The Washington Post and Times Herald''; July 8, 1956, pg, H3</ref>

The same year, Roberts made his television debut in the "Shadow of Suspicion" episode of ''[[Kraft Television Theater]]'', followed by guest- starring roles in ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', [[Cimarron City (TV series)|''Cimarron City'']], ''[[Buckskin (TV series)|Buckskin]]'', ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' and ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]''.<ref>IMDB</ref>

He signed a contract with [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1957 and made his film debut a year later as one of [[Burl Ives]]' contentious sons in ''[[Desire Under the Elms]]'' (1958). The film was nominated for a Best Cinematography Academy Award. He also landed character roles in such features as ''The Sheepman.''

He continued to guest star on television shows such as episodes of ''Shirley Temple Storybook Theater'' (''The Emperor's New Clothes, Rumplestiltskin, The Sleeping Beauty,'' and ''Hiawatha''),  the live-broadcast ''Matinee Theater'', where he starred again in Shakespeare's ''Much Ado About Nothing'', and in ''The Heart's Desire''. This was followed by appearances in ''[[Trackdown]]'', ''Buckskin'', and episodes of ''[[Zane Grey Theater]]''. Roberts guest-starred as Captain Jacques Chavez on the NBC adventure series ''Northwest Passage'' (1958), based on the life of Major Robert Rogers in the [[French and Indian War]]. He appeared with fellow guest star Fay Spain in the 1958 episode "Pick up the Gun" of ''Tombstone Territory'' and played the lead villain in the 31st episode ("Hey Boy's Revenge") of ''[[Have Gun &ndash; Will Travel]]'', portraying a killer boss exploiter of Chinese Coolie laborers.<ref name="Bonanza Dcanary.com/Pernell">Bonanza Dcanary.com/Pernell</ref>
In 1959 Roberts guest starred in episodes of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', ''Cimarron City, [[Sugarfoot]], Lawman, [[One Step Beyond]], Bronco, [[77 Sunset Strip]], The Detectives'' and ''House Call.''<ref name="Bonanza Dcanary.com/Pernell"/> Also in 1959, he co-starred with [[James Coburn]] in the film ''[[Ride Lonesome]]''. "If Roberts felt typecast by Westerns, they also provided his finest role in this film, arguably the greatest of the B-films, starring [[Randolph Scott]] and directed by Budd Boetticher. Roberts recognised the film's classic structure; his engaging outlaw, Sam Boone, counterpoints Scott's granite-faced Ben Brigade, maintaining the tension of whether they will work together or clash. He similarly played off James Coburn, who was making his film debut as Boone's quiet sidekick, Whit."<ref>

The same year he was cast in ''Bonanza''.

==''Bonanza''==
[[File:Pernell Roberts in Bonanza opening credits episode Bitter Water.jpg|thumb|right|As Adam in the opening credits.]]
Roberts played Ben Cartwright's urbane eldest son Adam, in the Western television series ''[[Bonanza]]''. Unlike his brothers, Adam was a university educated architectural engineer.

Roberts, having largely been "a stage actor, accustomed as he was to a rigorous diet of the classics"<ref name="joseph jefferson"/> and to freely move about from part to part, found the "transition to a television series," playing the same character, "without costume changes," a difficult one.<ref name="cnn"/> "It was perhaps not surprising that, despite enormous success, he bolted from "Bonanza" after the 1964–65 season, criticizing the show's simple-minded content and lack of minority actors...".<ref name="joseph jefferson">{{Cite web

My being part of ''Bonanza'' was like [[Isaac Stern]] sitting in with [[Lawrence Welk]]".<ref>"Ponderosa Gold Under A Painted Sky," Joanne Stang, p.&nbsp;305 in "Popular Culture," by David Manning, 1975</ref>

In much later interviews, Roberts denied statements about ''Bonanza'' attributed to him. "I did not enjoy ''Bonanza'' anymore...but I never said those things people said I said."<ref>''The Pittsburgh Press,'' 1979</ref> He was, however, "too smart not to recognize its weaknesses."<ref>''[[TV Guide]]'' 1982{{page needed|date=January 2014}}, "Why Is Pernell Roberts So Angry?", Dwight Whitney</ref> In a 1963 interview, he asked a reporter, "Isn't it a bit silly for three adult males to have to ask father's permission for everything they do?"<ref>''Washington Post'', January 25, 2010</ref> "They told me the four characters ([[Lorne Greene]], patriarch Ben, [[Dan Blocker]] and [[Michael Landon]] as his brothers) would be carefully defined and the scripts carefully prepared; none of it ever happened," he complained to The [[Associated Press]] in 1964.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} He objected to how ''Bonanza'' portrayed the relationship between the "father" and adult "sons,"  describing it as adolescent,<ref>Mike Douglas Show, 1966{{when|date=January 2014}}</ref> lacking in "truth" and lacking in "reality."<ref>''Weekly World News'', August 4, 1981, page 29</ref>{{rs|date=May 2015}}

Roberts acknowledged reasons for ''Bonanza'''s appeal, but pointed to his personal need for story lines with greater social relevance, adult themes and dialogue. He wanted ''Bonanza'' to be "a little more grown up," (Mike Douglas Show, 1966).  He also noted that he was not suited to the "procedural" and "confining aspect" of series television, another reason for his dissatisfaction, while on the show (''[[Mike Douglas Show]],'' 1966).
[[File:Pernell Roberts in "The Hopefuls".jpg|thumb|left|As Adam in "The Hopefuls" (1960).]]

Roberts had had high hopes for what he could contribute to ''Bonanza,'' and was disappointed with the direction of the show, the limitations imposed on his ''Bonanza'' character, and on his acting range. In a newspaper interview he said, "I haven't grown at all since the series began...I have an impotent role. Wherever I turn there's the father image," (This Time Pernell Won't Need a Tuba, Washington Post, May 1, 1963, Lawrence Laurent).

Finally, after disagreements with writers and producers over the quality of the scripts, characterization, and ''Bonanza'''s refusal to allow him to perform elsewhere while on contract, Roberts "turned his back on Hollywood wisdom and well-meant advice," and left, largely to return to legitimate theater (''Washington Post'', January 25, 2010; ''New York Daily News'' January 26, 2010; ''[[Mike Douglas Show]],'' 1965, 1966); ''[[Henry Darrow]]'' Archival Interview; ''USA Today'', January 25, 2010).

Roberts fulfilled but did not extend his six-year contract for ''Bonanza'',<ref name="phil"/> and when he left the series, his character was eliminated with the explanation that Adam had "moved away."<ref name="phil"/> Later episodes suggested variously that Adam was "at sea", had moved to Europe, or was on the East Coast, running that end of the family business. The last episode Pernell Roberts worked on was "Dead and Gone", air date April 4, 1965. He appeared in the next two that aired which were filmed prior to "Dead and Gone" — "A Good Night's Rest", air date April 11, 1965 and "To Own The World", air date April 18, 1965. Adam Cartwright was mentioned on occasion in the series (including a 1967 episode which did not air until April 4, 1971 ("Kingdom of Fear"). Dortort had hoped Roberts might return, but he never did. In television interviews, Roberts said that he would have stayed with ''Bonanza'', had he been allowed to do so on a part-time basis to enable him to return to theater (''[[Mike Douglas Show]]'', 1966). Bonanza producer [[David Dortort]] described Roberts as "rebellious, outspoken... and aloof," but, as one who "could make any scene he was in better..." (Archive Interview-web). In a later archive interview, he regretted not having insisted on a "marriage for Adam" and having Roberts continue on the show as a semi-regular. He added, "I must confess..I was too hard on him. I did not appreciate him. I knew he was good, but I didn't realize he was that good...none better." (Archive Interview 2002; Bonanza, The Official First Season, Volume 1, Feature, CBS/Paramount, 2009). In the last two "Bonanza" movies that aired on NBC in the early 1990s, the story line stated that Adam, now in Australia, had equaled his father's success, dominating the engineering/construction business.

Roberts was the only accomplished singer of the original cast, though [[David Canary]], who joined ''Bonanza'' in 1967, had a background in voice and performed on Broadway. During Roberts' ''Bonanza'' years, he recorded ''Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies'', a [[folk music]] album which ''[[Allmusic]]'' calls "...the softer, lyrical side of folk music — pleasant and not challenging, but quite rewarding in its unassuming way."<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r479459|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic entry for ''Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies''.] Accessed October 28, 2008.</ref> The album, released by [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] and arranged by [[Dick Rosmini]], is available on compact disc only as part of the fourth disc of the ''Bonanza'' 4-CD [[boxed set]] on [[Bear Family Records]].<ref>[http://www.bear-family.de/index.php?sid=3bc88a6e6092e4372fd0683585c0eb6d&cl=details&anid=8f13111c25a0b1583b68c1e3f5601720&listtype=search&tcalbumtitel=Bonanza&tcexact=0 Bear Family boxed set] Accessed November 7, 2008</ref>

On the ''Bonanza'' box set albums, Roberts also sings "Early One Morning," "In the Pines," "The New Born King," "The Bold Soldier," "Mary Ann," "[[They Call the Wind Maria]]," "Sylvie," "Lily of the West" "The Water is Wide," "Rake and a Ramblin' Boy," "A Quiet Girl," "Shady Grove," "Alberta," and "Empty Pocket Blues."

Roberts stated that he loved his co-stars and didn't want to leave them but the money just wasn't that important to him at the time. He felt he could do better elsewhere.

==After ''Bonanza''==
[[File:Pernell Roberts Welcome Home 1972.jpg|thumb|Publicity photo of Pernell Roberts, 1972.]]

After ''Bonanza'', Roberts played the [[summer stock theatre|straw hat circuit]], regional theaters, and episodic TV, which gave him the opportunity to play a wide variety of roles. He toured with musicals such as ''[[The King and I]],'' ''[[Kiss Me Kate]]'', ''[[Camelot (musical)Camelot]]'' and ''[[The Music Man]]'' and dramas such as ''[[Tiny Alice]]''. He played Jigger in an ABC television presentation of ''[[Carousel (film)|Carousel]]'' and was featured in a CBS Playhouse production, ''Dear Friends''.

In 1967, Roberts starred in the lavish, but short-lived [[David Merrick]] production of ''[[Mata Hari]]'', directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]]. The show had a much publicized "chaotic" preview performance due to technical problems stemming from lack of rehearsal time at the [[Kennedy Center]], Washington, D.C., where the preview performance took place. "What was offered the people of Washington was a dress rehearsal. David Merrick spoke to the audience beforehand warning them of this."<ref>{{cite book

In 1973, Roberts was nominated for a [[Joseph Jefferson Award]] for his performance in ''[[Welcome Home (play)|Welcome Home]]'' at the [[Ivanhoe Theatre]] in Chicago.<ref name="joseph jefferson"/>

The same year, Roberts starred as [[Rhett Butler]] opposite [[Lesley Ann Warren]], in another major production, ''[[Gone with the Wind]],'' at the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion|Chandler Pavilion]] in Los Angeles, again receiving good personal reviews, amidst weak reviews for the rest of the show.<ref>{{cite news

Additional stage credits after ''Bonanza'' include ''[[Two for the Seesaw]],'' ''[[A Thousand Clowns]],'' ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' ''[[Any Wednesday]],'' and  ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (as [[Georg Ludwig von Trapp|Captain von Trapp]]).

He did ''[[The Night of the Iguana]]'' while still playing in ''Bonanza'' in 1963.

Roberts guest starred in TV shows such as ''[[The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.]],'' ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]],'' ''[[The Big Valley]],'' ''[[Lancer]],'' ''[[Mission: Impossible]],'' ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]],'' ''[[The Wild Wild West]],'' ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]],'' ''[[The Rockford Files]],'' ''[[Gunsmoke]],'' ''[[Mannix]],'' ''[[Vega$]],'' ''[[The Odd Couple]],'' ''[[Hawaii Five-O]],'' ''[[The Love Boat]],'' ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]],'' ''[[San Francisco International Airport (TV series)|San Francisco International Airport]],'' ''[[Nakia (TV series)|Nakia]],'' ''Night Gallery,'' ''The Bold Ones,'' ''The Quest,'' ''Police Story,'' ''Most Wanted,'' ''Westside Medical,'' ''Man From Atlantis,'' ''Jigsaw John,'' ''Sixth Sense,'' ''Quincy, M.E.,'' ''[[The Feather and Father Gang]],'' ''Hawkins,'' ''Men from Shiloh,'' ''Perry Mason,'' ''Wide World of Mystery,'' and ''The Six Million Dollar Man,'' and appeared in miniseries, including ''[[Captains and the Kings]],'' ''[[Centennial (miniseries)|Centennial]],'' ''Hotel,'' ''The Immigrants,'' and ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (TV miniseries)|Around the World in 80 Days]].'' He starred in two cult films, ''[[Four Rode Out]]'' and ''[[Kashmiri Run]],'' directed by the veteran TV director [[John Peyser]], and made some feature films, including ''[[The Magic of Lassie]].'' He co-starred or was featured in several TV movies, including, ''[[The Adventures of Nick Carter]],'' ''Dead Man on the Run,'' ''The Night Rider,'' ''The Silent Gun,'' ''The Lives of Jenny Dolan,'' ''[[The Deadly Tower]],'' ''[[Hot Rod]],'' ''[[Desperado (TV Movie)|Desperado]],'' ''[[The Bravos]],'' ''[[High Noon, Part II]],'' and ''[[Assignment Munich]].''

In 1979, Roberts again achieved "superstar" status (''[[TV Guide]]'', 1982) as the lead in ''[[Trapper John, M.D.]]'' (1979–1986), receiving an [[Emmy]] nomination in 1981; and playing the character twice as long as [[Wayne Rogers]] had (1972–1975) on [[CBS]]{{'}}s ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' series. Roberts told ''[[TV Guide]]'' (1979) that he chose to return to weekly television after watching his father age, and realizing that it was a vulnerable time to be without financial security. "The show allowed Roberts to both use his dramatic range and address issues," wrote ''[[The Independent]]."

Of the period between series, Roberts said he enjoyed moving around and playing different characters. During that time, he also toured university campuses conducting seminars on play production, acting and poetry.<ref>{{cite news

In 1988, Roberts co-starred with [[Milla Jovovich]] in the TV movie ''[[The Night Train to Kathmandu]]."

He guest starred as Hezekiah Horn in the powerful ''[[The Young Riders|Young Riders]]'' episode, "Requiem for a Hero," for which he won a [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum#Western Heritage Awards|Western Heritage Award]] in 1991.<ref>[http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/e_awar_winn_ficdr.html#factualtvdrama Western Heritage Award]</ref>

In interviews, Roberts had described television as a "director's and film cutter's medium," <ref>''The Pittsburgh Press," "Cartwrights Meant Cartwheels," Vince Leonard, April 28, 1967.</ref> but he himself was described as a "born television actor........low key." <ref>(TV Guide, 1982).</ref>

In the 1980s and 1990s, playing off his ''Trapper John M.D.'' persona, Roberts acted as TV spokesman for [[Ecotrin]], a brand of [[analgesic]] tablets.

Recent roles included ''[[Donor (1990 film)|Donor]]'' (thriller, 1990) with [[Melissa Gilbert]] and ''[[Checkered Flag (film)|Checkered Flag]]''. <ref>(action, 1990).</ref>

He appeared as captain of the CBS teams for Battle of the Network Stars 11 and 12.

He narrated documentaries, including the National Geographic episode, "Alaska, The Great Land," in 1965; "In the Realm of the Alligator," in 1986; the TV special [[Code One]], about the work of paramedics, 1989 and, "The Mountain Men" episode of the History Channel, 1999.

From 1991 to 1993, in his last venture into series television, Roberts lent his distinctive voice to host and narrate the TV anthology series, ''[[FBI: The Untold Stories]]''.

He made his last TV appearance in 2001 on an episode of ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]," updating a ''[[Mannix]]'' character he had portrayed decades before.

In his later life, and after the death of all of his former ''Bonanza'' co-stars, Roberts "jokingly referred to himself as, 'Pernell, the last one, Roberts'. <ref>(New York Times, January 26, 2010; Cowboydirectory.com).</ref> He read ''[[Bonanza Gold Magazine]]," which was like looking at an old family album he said, and watched reruns of ''Bonanza'' when he wanted to see old friends. <ref>(''Bonanza Gold Magazine," 2005).</ref>

Shortly after his death, his friend and former costar, [[Gregory Harrison]], released a statement: "Pernell was a wonderful man, a good friend, and a big part of my life, especially when I was just beginning as an actor. He was a true inspiration to me, as he was to many actors over the years. I was so lucky to have shared the screen with him for nearly eight seasons, and am deeply saddened at his passing. Fortunately, he lives on in the memories of his fans, and in the hearts of the lucky people, like you and me, that he touched personally. I'll be forever grateful to him."
