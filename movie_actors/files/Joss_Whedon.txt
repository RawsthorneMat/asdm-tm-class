====''Angel''====
As a result of ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''{{'}}s success, Whedon was allowed the opportunity to make his 1999 spin-off series, ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. David Greenwalt and Whedon collaborated on the pilot that was going to be developed for [[The WB|The WB Network]].<ref name="SALON">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/10/04/angel/|title=City of Angel|first=Joyce|last=Millman|date=October 4, 1999|publisher=salon.com|accessdate=May 9, 2013|archivedate=January 14, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114132424/http://www.salon.com/1999/10/04/angel|deadurl=no}}</ref> During the series' early expansion, efforts were made by the network to mitigate Whedon's original concept.

In July 2010, it was confirmed that Whedon would write and direct ''The Avengers'', a live-action adaptation of the superhero team [[Avengers (comics)|of the same name]].<ref name="/Film; The Avengers">{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/joss-whedon-officially-directing-the-avengers/|title=Joss Whedon Officially Directing The Avengers|first=Devindra|last=Hardawar|date=July 22, 2010|publisher=slashfilm.com|accessdate=June 6, 2013|archivedate=November 23, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123181344/http://www.slashfilm.com/joss-whedon-officially-directing-the-avengers/|deadurl=no}}</ref> On his desire to take on the film, he said, "It goes back to the very first incarnation of ''The Avengers'', it goes to ''[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]'', it goes to everything about it. It makes no sense, it's ridiculous ... Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community. And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much. Obviously this will be expressed through punching but it will be the heart of the film".<ref name="io9; The Avengers">{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5595293/will-joss-whedons-avengers-movie-include-marvels-civil-war-we-asked-him|title=Joss Whedon says Captain America and Iron Man won't be pals in his "Avengers"|first=Meredith|last=Woerner|date=July 24, 2010|publisher=io9.com|accessdate=June 7, 2013|archivedate=July 25, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725202143/http://io9.com/5595293/will-joss-whedons-avengers-movie-include-marvels-civil-war-we-asked-him|deadurl=no}}</ref>

About the cinematography, DP [[Seamus McGarvey]] said that he and Whedon "were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image" and "wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film".<ref name="ARRI; The Avengers">{{cite web|url=http://www.arri.com/news.html?article=950&cHash=6adfecc263fdc3b7765b4e2f93a73f81|title=AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!|first=An|last=Tran|publisher=arri.com|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref> They used the digital camera [[Arri Alexa]] when shooting the film.<ref name="ARRI; The Avengers" /> Whedon commented on the conversion of ''The Avengers'' [[2D to 3D conversion|from 2D to 3D]], saying that "current 3D conversion technology is really amazing, and Marvel is very picky. Having a sense for things in a 3D space and filming while feeling that space was a very easy thing for me. I’m just tired of seeing just things flying toward the camera. So I had to make things look good for 3D in 2D.

In March 2012, Whedon stated that although television involves more compromise than film:

{{quote|I think, ultimately, gun to my head, TV is the place.

In summer 2014, Whedon encountered artist Shawnee Kilgore on [[Kickstarter]]. He said of her project, "I really loved the music and the sound of her voice". Whedon funded her album shortly after. When Kilgore contacted him about his fulfillment reward, he suggested they make a song together. She agreed, and received lyrics to one called "Big Giant Me". To Whedon, the song epitomized "the idea of change, and how much someone will accept you for yourself and what you are and what you’re going to become". The collaboration was then repurposed into producing an [[extended play]].<ref name="BuzzFeed; ep collaboration">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/joss-whedon-shawnee-kilgore-big-giant-me|title=Inside The Secret Folk Song Joss Whedon Co-Wrote While Making "The Avengers 2"|first=Adam B.|last=Vary|date=August 8, 2014|publisher=buzzfeed.com|accessdate=August 8, 2014|archivedate=September 8, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908082017/http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/joss-whedon-shawnee-kilgore-big-giant-me#1sygny3|deadurl=no}}</ref> Whedon's work on ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' required the progress on the EP to be held back.<ref name="horrible update" />

In college, Whedon studied the theory called "[[Womb and vagina envy|womb envy]]",<ref name="AFTERELLEN; feminism" /> a concept he says observes "a fundamental thing that women have something men don't, the obvious being an ability to bear children, and the resilience to hang in as parents. I don't understand why or how anyone ever pulled off the whole idea of 'women are inferior'. Men not only don't get what's important about what women are capable of, but in fact they fear it, and envy it, and want to throw stones at it, because it's the thing they can't have".<ref name="Mother Jones; feminism">{{cite web|url=http://www.motherjones.com/media/2008/11/mojo-interview-joss-whedon|title=The MoJo Interview: Joss Whedon|first=Sheerly|last=Avni|date=November–December 2008|publisher=motherjones.com|accessdate=July 12, 2014|archivedate=February 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214134655/http://www.motherjones.com/media/2008/11/mojo-interview-joss-whedon|deadurl=no}}</ref> In 2007, Whedon expressed his outrage over the [[murder of Du'a Khalil Aswad]], and because the act was caught on video, was prompted to attack the underlying attitude he felt led to the murder, comparing the video to [[Splatter film|torture porn]]. He wrote, "[Womb envy is] entirely true. How else to explain the fact that cultures who would die to eradicate each other have always agreed on one issue?

In late 2013, Whedon spoke at an Equality Now event, where he issued a pointed dissection of the word "[[:wikt:feminist|feminist]]". He begins to say, "I have the privilege living my life inside of words ... but part of being a writer is also living in the very smallest part of every word". Arguing against the suffix "[[:wikt:-ist|-ist]]", he continues, "you can't be born an –ist. It's not natural". Whedon explains that because of this, the word "includes the idea that believing men and women to be equal ... is not a natural state. That we don't emerge assuming that everybody in the human race is a human. That the idea of equality is just an idea that's imposed on us..."<ref name="The Atlantic; feminism">{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/what-joss-whedon-gets-wrong-about-the-word-feminist/281305/|title=What Joss Whedon Gets Wrong About the Word 'Feminist'|first=Noah|last=Berlatsky|date=November 8, 2013|publisher=theatlantic.com|accessdate=July 12, 2014|archivedate=November 9, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109005856/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/what-joss-whedon-gets-wrong-about-the-word-feminist/281305/|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="TOR*COM; feminism">{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/11/joss-whedon-hates-the-word-feminist-so-what-does-that-mean|title=Joss Whedon Hates the Word Feminist!

'''Note:''' Due to the frequency Whedon casts the same actors in various projects, the above list only includes those that have played three or more different roles in a Whedon production (actors that have only played the same role in multiple Whedon productions are not included).

==Personal life==
Whedon is married to Kai Cole, who is an architect, and the producer and co-founder of [[Bellwether Pictures]].<ref name="IW" /> They have two children, Arden and Squire, and live in Los Angeles.<ref name="The Telegraph; personal life">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8157067/Joss-Whedon-The-man-behind-the-Buffy-series.html|title=Joss Whedon: The man behind the Buffy series|first=Daisy|last=Dunn|date=November 24, 2010|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=December 6, 2013|archivedate=November 27, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127164249/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8157067/Joss-Whedon-The-man-behind-the-Buffy-series.html|deadurl=no}}</ref>

A committed [[Humanism|humanist]], Whedon was presented with the Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism by the Humanist Chaplaincy at [[Harvard University]].<ref name="boston.com; religious and philosophical views">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/more_names/blog/2009/04/harvard_to_honor_buffy_creator.html|title=Harvard to honor "Buffy" creator Joss Whedon|publisher=boston.com|accessdate=July 13, 2014|archivedate=April 14, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414064429/http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/more_names/blog/2009/04/harvard_to_honor_buffy_creator.html|deadurl=no}}</ref> He has also spoken about [[existentialism]], explaining in detail how it, and more specifically [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'', was used as a basis for the ''Firefly'' episode "[[Objects in Space]]".

===Political views===
In July 2012, at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], in response to one woman who noted the [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] themes in many of his films, and asked him to give his [[Philosophy and economics|economic philosophy]] in 30 seconds or less, Whedon spoke out against both the [[socialism]] he was brought up listening to and [[capitalism]] as well, stating that "ultimately all these systems don't work".  He went on to say that America is "turning into Tsarist Russia".<ref name="The Wrap">{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/tv/column-post/joss-whedon-america-turning-tsarist-russia-47756|title=Comic-Con 2012: Joss Whedon: America Is Turning Into 'Tsarist Russia'|publisher=TheWrap.com|date=July 13, 2012|accessdate=July 28, 2012|archivedate=April 11, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411065235/http://www.thewrap.com/tv/column-post/joss-whedon-america-turning-tsarist-russia-47756/|deadurl=no}}</ref> Endorsing [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 United States presidential election]],<ref name="HUFFINGTON POST">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/28/joss-whedon-romney-ad-zombie-apocalypse-video_n_2036055.html|title=Joss Whedon's Romney Ad Endorses GOP Candidate Because Of Power To Bring Forth Zombie Apocalypse (VIDEO)|date=October 28, 2012|publisher=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=February 23, 2013|archivedate=October 30, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030025257/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/28/joss-whedon-romney-ad-zombie-apocalypse-video_n_2036055.html|deadurl=no}}</ref> Whedon satirically equated [[Mitt Romney]]'s future as president with a [[Zombie#Zombie apocalypse|zombie apocalypse]], "Romney is ready to make the deep rollbacks in health care, education, social services and reproductive rights that will guarantee poverty, unemployment, overpopulation, disease, rioting—all crucial elements in creating a nightmare zombie wasteland".<ref name="YouTube; Whedon on Romney">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TiXUF9xbTo|title=Whedon On Romney|publisher=YouTube|date=October 28, 2012|accessdate=October 28, 2012|archivedate=October 29, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029141803/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TiXUF9xbTo|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Cinemablend; Whedon on Romney">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/pop/Watch-Joss-Whedon-Anti-Romney-Ad-Warns-Zombie-Apocalypse-48699.html|title=Watch: Joss Whedon Anti-Romney Ad Warns Of A Zombie Apocalypse|publisher=Cinemablend|date=October 28, 2012|accessdate=October 28, 2012|archivedate=November 1, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101232723/http://www.cinemablend.com/pop/Watch-Joss-Whedon-Anti-Romney-Ad-Warns-Zombie-Apocalypse-48699.html|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Policy makers who deny basic scientific truth should also be denied penicillin, horseless carriages, [and] air time on the magic box of shadows".<ref name="horseless carriages">{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/04/23/3650464/joss-whedon-climate-change/|title=Joss Whedon: Politicians Who Deny Climate Change ‘Deny Basic Scientific Truth’|first=Emily|last=Atkin|date=April 23, 2015|publisher=ThinkProgress|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>
