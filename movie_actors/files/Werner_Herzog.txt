'''Werner Herzog Stipetić''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʋɛɐ̯nɐ ˈhɛɐ̯tsoːk ˈstɪpɛtɪt͡ʃ|lang}}; born 5 September 1942), known as '''Werner Herzog''', is a German film director, producer, screenwriter, author, actor and opera director.

Herzog is considered one of the greatest figures of the [[New German Cinema]], along with [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Margarethe von Trotta]], [[Volker Schlöndorff]], [[Werner Schröter]], and [[Wim Wenders]]. Herzog's films often feature heroes with impossible dreams,<ref name="empireonline">{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/40-great-actor-director-partnerships/default.asp?c=35 |title=40 Great Actor & Director Partnerships: Klaus Kinski & Werner Herzog |accessdate=June 19, 2010|work=Empire Magazine}}</ref> people with unique talents in obscure fields, or individuals who are in conflict with nature.<ref name="thedailystar.net">{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=107680 |title=Werner Herzog and his film language |accessdate=June 19, 2010|work=thedailystar.net}}</ref> French filmmaker [[François Truffaut]] once called Herzog "the most important film director alive."<ref>{{cite book | last = Cronin | first = Paul |author2=Werner Herzog  | title = Herzog on Herzog | publisher = Faber and Faber Limited | year = 2002 | location = London | pages = vii–viii | isbn = 978-0-571-20708-4 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ydN_2oj8M0wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Herzog+on+Herzog&hl=en&ei=FZ9QTeXfBsTJgQeErZywCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-preview-link&resnum=1&ved=0CDkQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q=truffaut&f=false}}</ref> American film critic [[Roger Ebert]] said that Herzog "has never created a single film that is compromised, shameful, made for pragmatic reasons or uninteresting.

==Early life==
Herzog was born Werner Herzog Stipetić in [[Munich]], to a German father, Dietrich Herzog, and a [[Croatia]]n mother,<ref name="Laster">{{cite web|last=Laster |first=Paul |url=http://www.observer.com/2011/05/werner-herzog-comes-out-of-the-cave/ |title=Werner Herzog Comes Out of the Cave |work=New York Observer |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref> Elizabeth Stipetić. His family moved to the remote Bavarian village of Sachrang (in the [[Chiemgau Alps]]), after the house next to theirs was destroyed during a bombing raid at the close of [[World War II]].<ref name=NPR>{{cite news |title=Werner Herzog on the Story Behind 'Rescue Dawn' |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11782309 |quote= |publisher=[[Fresh Air]] |date=October 27, 1998 |accessdate=June 21, 2007 }}</ref> When Herzog was 12, he and his family moved back to Munich. His father had abandoned the family early in his youth. 
Werner later adopted his father's surname ''Herzog'' (German for "duke"), which he thought sounded more impressive for a filmmaker.<ref name="Laster"/>

The same year, Herzog was told to sing in front of his class at school, and he adamantly refused. He was almost expelled. Until he was age eighteen, Herzog listened to no music, sang no songs, and studied no instruments. He later said that he would easily give ten years from his life to be able to play an instrument. At fourteen, he was inspired by an encyclopedia entry about filmmaking, which he says provided him with "everything I needed to get myself started" as a filmmaker—that, and the [[Movie camera|35 mm camera]] he stole from the Munich Film School.<ref name="bissell">Bissell, Tom. "The Secret Mainstream: Contemplating the mirages of Werner Herzog," ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]],'' December 2006</ref> In the commentary for ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'', he says, "I don't consider it theft—it was just a necessity—I had some sort of natural right for a camera, a tool to work with." He won a scholarship to [[Duquesne University]] and lasted but three days, but lived in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] creating documentaries for [[NASA]] with [[WQED (TV)|WQED]]. Eventually, he chose to study at the [[University of Munich]].<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rJJKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=820DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2945%2C2604477]"German Film-Maker Recalls Pittsburgh Break"</ref> While in his teens, Herzog traveled to various exotic places.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In the early 1960s, Herzog worked nightshifts as a [[welding|welder]] in a steel factory to help fund his first films. Before leaving school, he bought a house in the UK, in what was likely the [[Moss Side]] area of [[Manchester]]. There he learned to speak English.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cronin | first = Paul |author2=Werner Herzog  | title = Herzog on Herzog | publisher = Faber and Faber Limited |year = 2002 | location = London | pages = 1–2 | isbn = 978-0-571-20708-4 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ydN_2oj8M0wC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Herzog+on+Herzog&hl=en&ei=FZ9QTeXfBsTJgQeErZywCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-preview-link&resnum=1&ved=0CDkQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q=truffaut&f=false}}</ref> In 1962, he made his first short film, Herakles. In 1966 he worked briefly in television under the auspices of [[NASA]].<ref>Corrigan, Timothy. "Producing Herzog: from a body of images" in ''The films of Werner Herzog''. Edited by Timothy Corrigan. New York: Methuen, 1986, pp. 3–19.</ref>

In 1971, while Herzog was [[location scouting]] for ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' in Peru, he narrowly avoided taking [[LANSA Flight 508]]. Herzog's reservation was canceled due to a last-minute change in itinerary. The plane was later struck by lightning and disintegrated, but one survivor lived after a free fall. Long haunted by the event, nearly 30 years later he made a documentary film ''[[Wings of Hope]]'' (2000) about it, which explored the story of the sole survivor [[Juliane Koepcke]].

==Career==
[[File:WERNER HERZOG star.jpg|thumb|Werner Herzog's star in Boulevard der Stars in Berlin.]]

Besides using professional actors—German, American and otherwise—Herzog is known for using people from the locality in which he is shooting. Especially in his documentaries, he uses locals to benefit what he calls "ecstatic truth." He uses footage of the non-actors both playing roles and being themselves.

Herzog and his films have been nominated for and won many awards. His first major award was the [[Jury Grand Prix|Silver Bear Extraordinary Prize of the Jury]] for his first feature film ''[[Signs of Life (1968 film)|Signs of Life]]''<ref name="berlinale
 1968">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1968/03_preistr_ger_1968/03_Preistraeger_1968.html |title=Berlinale 1968: Prize Winners |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> (''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'' was also nominated for Golden Bear in 1979). Most notably, Herzog won the best director award for ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'' at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]]. In 1975, his movie ''[[The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser]]'' won The Special Jury Prize (also known as the 'Silver Palm') at the Cannes Festival. Other films directed by Herzog nominated for Golden Palm are: ''[[Woyzeck (1979 film)|Woyzeck]]'' and ''[[Where the Green Ants Dream]]''.

His films were nominated at many other important festivals around the world: [[César Awards]] (''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]''), [[Emmy Awards]] (''[[Little Dieter Needs to Fly]]''), [[European Film Awards]] (''[[My Best Fiend]]'') and [[Venice Film Festival]] (''[[Scream of Stone]]'' and ''[[The Wild Blue Yonder]]'').

In 1987, Herzog and his half-brother [[Lucki Stipetić]] won the [[Bayerischer Filmpreis|Bavarian Film Award]] for Best Producing for the film ''[[Cobra Verde]]''.<ref>[http://www.bayern.de/Anlage19170/PreistraegerdesBayerischenFilmpreises-Pierrot.pdf ]{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref> In 2002 he won the ''Dragon of Dragons Honorary Award'' during [[Kraków Film Festival]] in [[Kraków]].

Herzog was honored at the 49th [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], receiving the 2006 Film Society Directing Award.<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://fest06.sffs.org/awards/werner_herzog.php |title=Film Society Directing Award |accessdate=April 8, 2009|work=sffs.org |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080527080736/http://fest06.sffs.org/awards/werner_herzog.php |archivedate = May 27, 2008}}</ref> Four of his films have been shown at the San Francisco International Film Festival: ''[[Wodaabe - Herdsmen of the Sun]]'' in 1990, ''[[Bells from the Deep]]'' in 1993, ''[[Lessons of Darkness]]'' in 1993, and ''[[The Wild Blue Yonder]]'' in 2006. Herzog's April 2007 appearance at the [[Ebertfest]] in Champaign, Illinois earned him the Golden Thumb Award, and an engraved [[glockenspiel]] given to him by a young film maker inspired by his films. ''[[Grizzly Man]]'', directed by Herzog, won the [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]] at the 2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. ''[[Encounters at the End of the World]]'' won the award for Best Documentary at the 2008 [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature]], Herzog's first nomination.

[[File:Werner Herzog Bruxelles 02 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Herzog in Brussels, 2007]]
Herzog once promised to eat his shoe if [[Errol Morris]] completed the movie project on pet cemeteries that he had been working on, in order to challenge and motivate Morris, whom Herzog perceived as incapable of following up on the projects he conceived. In 1978, when the film ''[[Gates of Heaven]]'' premiered, Werner Herzog cooked and publicly ate his shoe, an event later incorporated into a short documentary ''[[Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe]]'' by [[Les Blank]]. At the event, Herzog suggested that he hoped the act would serve to encourage anyone having difficulty bringing a project to fruition.

In 2009, Herzog became the only filmmaker in recent history to enter two films in competition in the same year at the prestigious [[Venice Film Festival]]. Herzog's ''[[The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans]]'' was entered into the festival's official competition schedule, and his ''[[My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?]]'' entered the competition as a "surprise film".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSTRE5841N320090905 |title=Filmmaker Herzog is up against himself in Venice &#124; Film |publisher=Reuters |date=September 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2009}}</ref> Herzog also provided the narration for the short film [[Plastic Bag (film)|''Plastic Bag'']] directed by [[Ramin Bahrani]] which was the opening night film in the Corto Cortissimo section of the festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/festival/lineup/official_selection/corto_cortissimo/bag.html|title=66th Venice Film Festival Corto Cortissimo}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

Herzog also lent his voice to the animated television program ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' in the third season premiere episode "[[It's a Black President, Huey Freeman]]" in which he played himself filming a documentary about the series' cast of characters and their actions during the 2008 election of [[Barack Obama]]. He also played Walter Hotenhoffer (formerly known as Augustus Gloop) in the Simpsons episode [[The Scorpion's Tale]] which aired in March 2011.

Herzog completed a documentary called ''[[Cave of Forgotten Dreams]]'' in 2010, which shows his journey into the [[Chauvet Cave]] in France. Although generally skeptical of [[3-D film]] as a format,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planet-mag.com/2010/features/alex-shephard/werner-herzog-interview/ |title=Werner Herzog Interview &#124; PLANET° |publisher=Planet-mag.com |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref> Herzog premiered the film at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]] in 3-D and had its European premiere at the 2011 Berlinale.

Also in 2010, Herzog's documentary ''[[Happy People: A Year in the Taiga]]'', which portrays the life of fur [[Siberian fur trade|trapper]]s from the [[Siberia]]n part of the [[Taiga]], had its premiere at the 2010 [[Telluride Film Festival]].

In 2012, it was announced that Herzog would be directing a film adaptation of the 2003 novel [[Vernon God Little]].<ref name="BBCVernon">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20040069 |title=Werner Herzog to adapt Vernon God Little into film |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |work=BBC News | date=October 22, 20123}}</ref>

In 2011 Herzog competed with [[Ridley Scott]] for making a film based around the life of explorer [[Gertrude Bell]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Dang|first=Simon|title=Watch Out, Ridley: Werner Herzog's Gertrude Bell Film Starring Naomi Watts Hoping To Shoot In The Fall|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/watch-out-ridley-werner-herzogs-gertrude-bell-film-starring-naomi-watt-hoping-to-shoot-in-the-fall-20120520|publisher=IndieWire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>  In 2012, it was confirmed that Herzog would start production on his long-in-development project in March 2013 in [[Morocco]] with [[Naomi Watts]] to play Gertrude Bell along with [[Robert Pattinson]] to play [[T. E.

In 2012, Herzog lent his voice to the animated series ''[[Metalocalypse]]'' as the high holy priest of the Church of the Black Klok, [[List of Metalocalypse characters#Ishnifus Meaddle|Ishnifus Meaddle]].

On October 21, 2013, it was announced that Herzog had secured [[Nicole Kidman]] to replace Watts for the role of Gertrude Bell in his film ''Queen of the Desert'', with [[Damian Lewis]] playing Lt. Col. [[Charles Doughty-Wylie]]. Production was slated to begin in December 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming, Jr.|first=Mike|title=‘Homeland’s Damian Lewis To Star With Nicole Kidman In ‘Queen Of The Desert’|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/10/homelands-damian-lewis-to-star-with-nicole-kidman-in-queen-of-the-desert/|publisher=Deadline|accessdate=25 October 2013}}</ref>

==Film theory==
Herzog's films have received considerable critical acclaim and achieved popularity on the [[art house]] circuit. They have also been the subject of controversy in regard to their themes and messages, especially the circumstances surrounding their creation.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} A notable example is ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'', in which the obsessiveness of the central character was reflected by the director during the making of the film. ''[[Burden of Dreams]]'', a documentary filmed during the making of ''Fitzcarraldo'', explored Herzog's efforts to make the film in harsh conditions.

His treatment of subjects has been characterized as [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] in its scope, and ''[[Fitzcarraldo]]'' and his later film ''[[Invincible (2001 drama film)|Invincible]]'' (2001) are directly inspired by opera, or operatic themes. He is proud of never using [[storyboards]] and often improvising large parts of the script. He explains this technique in the commentary track to ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]''.

==Collaborations==
Herzog preferred to develop a team to work with, both of actors and technical people. He gathered a group who appeared in numerous films.

===Crew===
;Cinematographers
[[Thomas Mauch]] worked with Herzog on ten films: starting with ''Signs of Life'' and ''Last Words'' and ending with ''Fitzcarraldo''. He helped to create hallucinogenic atmosphere in ''Aguirre'' and the realistic style of ''Stroszek''. Mauch won Film Award in Gold and National Society of Film Critics Awards for ''Aguirre''. He was Herzog's first choice to be cinematographer during ''Cobra Verde.'' After excessive verbal abuse from Klaus Kinski, Mauch walked out of the project. That was Mauch and Herzog's final collaboration.

[[Jörg Schmidt-Reitwein]] worked with Herzog on seventeen films. Reitwein was Thomas Mauch's assistant camera during ''Even Dwarfs Started Small''. His first independent work for Herzog was ''Precautions Against Fanatics'' in 1969. He helped to create the poetical atmosphere of ''Fata Morgana'', ''Heart of Glass'', ''The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser'' and ''Nosferatu''. He won the Film Award in Gold for ''Heart of Glass'' and ''Where the Green Ants Dream'' at the German Film Awards. He last collaborated with Herzog during ''Pilgrimage'' in 2001.

[[Peter Zeitlinger]] collaborated with Herzog on thirteen films, from ''Gesualdo: Death for Five Voices'' (1995) to the television documentary ''Death Row'' (2011), including ''Rescue Dawn'' and ''Grizzly Man''. He was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for ''Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans'' in 2009.

;Producers
Walter Saxer produced sixteen of Herzog's films, including ''Nosferatu'' and ''The White Diamond''. He worked in the Sound Department during seven of Herzog's films, including ''The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner'' and ''Echoes from a Somber Empire''. He co-wrote ''Scream of Stone'' which Herzog directed. Saxer appeared as himself in Herzog's ''My Best Fiend'' and in Les Blank's ''Burden of Dreams'', in which he was also subjected to the verbal abuse of Kinski.

[[Lucki Stipetić]] is Herzog's half-brother, and he produced several Herzog films, including ''Aguirre'' and ''Invincible''. He is a head of Werner Herzog Productions. He won the [[Bavarian Film Award]] in 1988 for ''Cobra Verde'' and International Documentary Association Award for ''Little Dieter Needs to Fly'' in 1998. He was also nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] in 1998.

[[Andre Singer|André Singer]] worked either as an executive producer or producer on eight of Herzog’s documentaries, starting with “Lessons of Darkness” in 1991 and ending with “The Wild Blue Yonder.” He won the International Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival, 2006. He worked on the recent “La Bohème” (2009), and “Into the Abyss”/”Death Row”, 2011.

;Editors
[[Beate Mainka-Jellinghaus]] worked with Herzog on twenty films, from ''Signs of Life'' and ''Last Words'' (both from 1968) to ''Where the Green Ants Dream'' (1984). She won the Film Award in Gold during the German Film Awards for ''The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser'' in 1975.

[[Joe Bini]] has collaborated with Herzog on nineteen films, from ''Little Dieter Needs to Fly'' (1997) to ''Cave of Forgotten Dreams'' (2009). He was nominated by American Cinema Editors for Best Edited Documentary Film for ''Grizzly Man'' in 2005.

;Costume designers
Ann Poppel collaborated with Herzog on four films, including ''Nosferatu the Vampyre'' and ''Scream of Stone''. Gisela Storch worked with Herzog on six films: ''The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser'', ''Heart of Glass'', ''Nosferatu the Vampyre'', ''Woyzeck'', ''Fitzcarraldo'' and ''Cobra Verde''. She was nominated for a Saturn Award for ''Nosferatu the Vampyre'' in 1979.

;Composers
German Krautrock band [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]], founded by pianist and keyboardist Florian Fricke, have composed music for eight of Herzog's films: ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God'', ''The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner'', ''Heart of Glass'', ''Nosferatu'', ''The Dark Glow of the Mountains'', ''Fitzcarraldo'', ''Cobra Verde'' and ''My Best Fiend''. Their compositions were also used by Herzog in ''Rescue Dawn''. Florian Fricke made a cameo as a pianist in ''Signs of Life'' and ''The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser''. The band took its name from the ''Popol Vuh,'' a manuscript of the Quiché [[Maya peoples|Maya]] kingdom. They had seen Herzog's ''Fata Morgana'', in which [[Lotte Eisner]] reads parts of the ''Popol Vuh.''

Since 2001, for orchestral scores Herzog has mostly chosen [[Klaus Badelt]]. The first of so far four collaborations, "Invincible" (2001) was actually one of Badelt's first film scores. Badelt also wrote the scores to "Rescue Dawn" (2006), "Happy People: A Year in the Taiga" (2010), and is currently working on Herzog's upcoming feature "Queen of the Desert" (2015).

Herzog has invited [[Ernst Reijseger]] to compose scores to four of his films. Two were documentaries (''The White Diamond'' and ''Cave of Forgotten Dreams'') and two were features (''The Wild Blue Yonder'' and ''My Son, My Son What Have Ye Done''). His music was also used in ''Rescue Dawn'' and in a video documentary about recording music for ''Grizzly Man.'' It was entitled ''In the Edges: The 'Grizzly Man' Session'' directed by Erik Nelson. Reijseger also had a cameo in ''My Son, My Son What Have Ye Done''.

;Others
[[Henning von Gierke]] collaborated with Herzog on seven films and several operas. He was Production Designer during ''The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser'', ''Nosferatu the Vampyre'' and ''Fitzcarraldo''.

Gierke shot additional still photographs on ''Stroszek'''s set. He appeared twice in Herzog's film ''The Transformation of the World Into Music'' as himself and in Herzog's TV realisation of the opera ''Giovanna d'Arco''. Von Gierke won the Film Award in Gold for ''The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser'' at the German Film Awards and the [[Silver Bear|Silver Bear for an outstanding single achievement]] for ''Nosferatu'', at the [[29th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="berlinale 1978">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1979/03_preistr_ger_1979/03_Preistraeger_1979.html |title=Berlinale 1978: Prize Winners |accessdate=August 15, 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>
