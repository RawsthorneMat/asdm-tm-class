'''Yuen Biao''' (born 26 July 1957) is a [[Hong Kong people|Hong Kong]] [[actor]] and [[martial artist]]. He specialises in [[acrobatics]] and [[Chinese martial arts]] and has worked on over 80 films as actor, stuntman and [[stage combat|action choreographer]]. Along with [[Peking Opera School]] "brothers" at the ''China Drama Academy'', [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Jackie Chan]], he was one of the [[Peking Opera School#The Seven Little Fortunes|Seven Little Fortunes]].

==The early years==
Born Xia Lingzhen ({{zh|c=夏令震|p=Xià Lìngzhèn|w=Hsia Ling-chen}}) in Hong Kong, he was the fifth child in a family of eight children. At the age of six he was enrolled at the Peking Opera School ''The China Drama Academy''.  He was given the stage name Yuen Biao (Little Tiger) and trained alongside schoolmates [[Jackie Chan]], [[Sammo Hung]], [[Corey Yuen]], [[Yuen Wah]] and several others, under master [[Yu Jim-yuen]], who would later become famous in Hong Kong cinema. He quickly showed a talent for acrobatics. According to Jackie Chan's autobiography when Yuen was first asked by his master, upon his first day with him, to do a backflip, Yuen did a proper backflip on his very first try. He remained at the school until the age of 16.<ref>{{cite book |title= I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action |date= June 28, 1999 |publisher= Ballantine Books |isbn= 0-345-42913-3}}</ref> When he left, Yuen followed his classmate Sammo Hung into a career in the Hong Kong film industry.

==Film career==
{{Further|Yuen Biao filmography}}

Yuen Biao has appeared in over 130 films. He has played roles in eight television series for Hong Kong channel [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]].

===Early 1970s===
In the early 1970s, Yuen began work as a [[stunt performer|stuntman]] and [[Extra (actor)|extra]]. After working on ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', Yuen became a stunt double for [[Bruce Lee]] on ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', in 1973. He was also one of the "fake" Bruce Lees in ''[[Game of Death]]'' (1978), performing the acrobatics and stunts that the Bruce Lee "[[body double]]" ([[Taekwondo]] expert, [[Kim Tai Chung]]) was unable to perform. Yuen continued working as a stuntman, doubling for actors in [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action films]] and taking on supporting actor roles.

During his early acting period, he adopted the anglicised name Bill Yuen for use on the Hong Kong films that were released internationally. However, recognising the growing success of Jackie Chan, [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] were keen to give him a similar name, and on some international film prints, he was credited as Jimmy Yuen. Both anglicised names were later dropped.<ref>{{cite video

===Late 1970s and 1980s===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, thanks to his good friends and former classmates, [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Jackie Chan]], he began working more frequently as an actor. After his co starring role in ''The Dragon, the Odds'' (1977) and his full lead role debut in ''[[Knockabout (film)|Knockabout]]'' (1978), he starred in several films in the early 1980s, notably ''[[The Prodigal Son (1981 film)|The Prodigal Son]]'' (directed by Sammo Hung) and ''[[Dreadnaught (film)|Dreadnaught]]'' (directed by [[Yuen Woo-ping]]). He later co starred alongside his Peking Opera "brothers", Chan and Hung, in ''[[Project A]]'', ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' and ''[[Dragons Forever]]'', and also appeared in smaller roles in films such as Hung's original ''[[Lucky Stars]]'' trilogy.

===1990s===
Yuen's acting roles waned somewhat in the early 1990s, although he notably played a supporting role alongside [[Jet Li]] in ''[[Once Upon a Time in China]]'' (1991). Yuen did not appear in the [[Once Upon a Time in China II|sequel]] as he was replaced by [[Max Mok]]. In the late 1990s, films such as ''[[Hero (1997 film)|Hero]]'' (1997) co starring [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]] and ''[[A Man Called Hero]]'' (1999) co starring [[Ekin Cheng]] saw Yuen return to the big screen. During this time he began to concentrate more on television work and took lead roles in the series ''Righteous Guards'' and ''The Legend of a Chinese Hero'' in 1998.

===2000s===
In 2000, Yuen went to the [[United States]] to work with Jackie Chan as the action choreographer on ''[[Shanghai Noon]]''. In 2001, he co starred alongside Hung in ''The Avenging Fist''. Yuen also starred in a more comedic role in the 2002 Japan HK film ''No Problem 2''.

He is best known for his acrobatic action scenes which often overshadow the work of his more famous co-stars, especially in films such as ''[[Eastern Condors]]'' (co starring Sammo Hung) and ''[[Dragons Forever]]''.

In 2005, Yuen starred in a [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]] series called ''[[Real Kung Fu]]'' with [[Yuen Wah]], [[Maggie Siu]], [[Leung Kar Yan]], [[Jack Wu]] and one of Sammo Hung's real life son, [[Timmy Hung]].

In 2006, Yuen plays Inspector Steve Mok in [[Rob-B-Hood|Robin B Hood]] along with his long-time friend Jackie Chan.

In 2007 he finished filming the [[Wing Chun (TV series)|''Wing Chun'' TV series]] (a remake of the 1994 series that had preceded the film ''[[Wing Chun (film)|Wing Chun]]'') alongside [[Nicholas Tse]], Sammo Hung and another of Hung's sons, Sammy Hung. Biao plays an elder version of the character [[Leung Jan]], the role he played 25 years earlier in ''The Prodigal Son'', and father to Tse's character.<ref>{{cite web

The series has since been re-edited for release as a film, entitled ''Shuang Long Ji'' (aka ''Legend of Twins Dragon''). However, the film's release has been delayed as it has been banned in [[Mainland China]] for containing too much violence.<ref>{{cite web

Yuen appeared as a guest judge on the [[China Beijing TV Station]] [[reality television]] series ''The Disciple'', which airied in Mainland China and was produced by, and featured Jackie Chan. The aim of the program was to find a new star, skilled in acting and martial arts, to become Chan's "successor", the champion being awarded the lead role in a film. It concluded on June 7, 2008, with the series winner being announced in [[Beijing]].<ref>{{cite web

Yuen will also be starring alongside [[Bryan Leung]] and [[Ji Chunhua]] in ''Legend of Shaolin Kung-fu II: Thirteen Cudgel Monks'', a new film directed by [[Yuen Bun]].
