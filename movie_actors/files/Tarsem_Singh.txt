In 2003, Tarsem directed one of the most elaborate [[Pepsi]] commercials to date.  It combined a gladiator theme with [[Queen (band) | Queen]]'s "[[We Will Rock You]]". The commercial starred [[Enrique Iglesias]] in the version of the commercial aired in Europe and North America and [[Amr Diab]] in the version aired in the Arab world.

Ultimately the gladiatrices turn against the emperor and throw him from his seat.
