'''Alma Rubens''' (February 19, 1897 – January 21, 1931) was an American film [[actress]] and stage performer. 

Rubens began her career in the mid 1910s. She quickly rose to stardom in 1916 after appearing opposite [[Douglas Fairbanks]] in ''The Half Breed''. For the remainder of the decade, she appeared in supporting roles in comedies and drama. In the 1920s, Rubens developed a drug addiction which eventually ended her career. She died of [[lobar pneumonia]] and [[bronchitis]] shortly after being arrested for [[cocaine]] possession in early January 1931.

==Early life==
She was born '''Alma Genevieve Reubens''' to John B. and Theresa (née Hayes) Rueben in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].<ref name=rhodes>{{harv|Rubens, Rhodes, Webb|2006|p=25}}</ref> Her father was of French descent and her mother was of Irish heritage.<ref name=rhodes /> She had an older sister, Hazel.<ref name=rhodes /> She was raised in the [[Roman Catholic]] faith and attended Sacred Heart Convent in San Francisco.<ref name=rhodes /> Some biographies erroneously state that her birth name was Genevieve Driscoll. The name was in fact a pseudonym that she later used in a non-professional capacity, as Genevieve was her middle name and Driscoll was her maternal grandmother's maiden name.<ref>{{harv|Rubens, Rhodes, Webb|2006|p=26}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:I love You.jpg|thumb|left|Rubens as "Felice" in ''I Love You'' (1918)]]
Her first stage opportunity came when a chorus girl in a musical comedy theater troupe became ill. Rubens was chosen to take her place and joined the troupe as a regular performer. There she met [[Franklyn Farnum]] who was also a member. He later convinced Rubens to leave the troupe and try her hand at film acting.<ref name="milwaukee">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KF9QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8A4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7047,2464785&dq=alma+rubens+daniel+carson+goodman&hl=en|title=Rise to Fame in Films Was Meteoric for Alma|date=February 16, 1929|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|page=4|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref>

In 1916, Rubens signed with [[Triangle Film Corporation]]. Her first film for the company was the comedy-drama ''[[Reggie Mixes In]]'', starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]]. Later that same year, Rubens was re-teamed with Fairbanks for [[cocaine]] comedy ''[[The Mystery of the Leaping Fish]]'', ''The Half Breed'' and ''[[The Americano (1916 film)|The Americano]]''. The next year, Rubens co-starred in two Westerns: [[William S. Hart]] in the Western ''Truthful Tolliver'' with [[William S. Hart]] and ''The Firefly of Tough Luck'', with [[Charles Gunn (actor)|Charles Gunn]]. In 1918, she announced that she was changing the spelling of her last name of Rueben to "Rubens" because it caused too much confusion in the movie industry and in publications. She later told ''[[Photoplay]]'' magazine, "As a matter of fact my name is not the same [spelling] as the painter's. It's either Reubens or Ruebens-I forget which. I never could spell it. Couldn't remember where the 'e' came. So I let it go Rubens."<ref>{{harv|Rubens, Rhodes, Webb|2006|p=11}}</ref>

In 1920, Rubens signed with [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s [[Cosmopolitan Productions]]. The studio promoted Rubens as their newest starlet, falsely claiming she was a descendant of Flemish painter [[Peter Paul Rubens]].<ref>{{harv|Rubens, Rhodes, Webb|2006|p=305}}</ref> Her first film for the studio was ''[[Humoresque (1920 film)|Humoresque]]'', which became the studio's only hit that year.<ref>{{harv|Nasaw|2000|p=306}}</ref> Later that year, she starred in dramas ''[[The World and His Wife]]'', opposite [[Montague Love]], and ''Thoughtless Women'', both of which further solidified her popularity. By 1921, Rubens had developed an addiction to [[heroin]] after she was prescribed [[morphine]] by a doctor for a physical ailment.<ref name="border">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PPZEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=l7oMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2166,6331909&dq=alma+rubens+patton&hl=en|title=Alma Ruben Tells Story Of Drug Cure|date=January 30, 1930|work=The Border Cities Star|page=16|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref> Due to her drug use and difficult behavior on set, William Randolph Hearst removed her from a film she was set to star in but kept her on the payroll for the next two years. There were rumors that Hearst continued to pay her a salary because the two were romantically involved. Hearst denied this claiming he continued to pay Rubens because he had invested a substantial amount of money promoting her as the studio's leading lady and that good lead actresses were difficult to find.<ref>{{harv|Nasaw|2000|pp=306-307}}</ref> Rubens returned to the screen in 1922 with roles in ''[[Find the Woman]]'' and ''[[The Valley of Silent Men]]''. Her final film for Cosmopolitan Productions was the historical drama ''[[Under the Red Robe (1923 film)|Under the Red Robe]]'', in 1923. Hearst released Ruben from her contract that same year.<ref>{{harv|Nasaw|2000|p=330}}</ref>

In 1924, she starred in ''The Price She Paid'' for Columbia Pictures Corporation and had a supporting role in the [[First National|Associated First National]] production ''[[Cytherea (1924 film)|Cytherea]]''. From 1925 to 1926, she worked for [[Fox Film Corporation]].<ref name="milwaukee" /> While at Fox, she starred in the hit melodrama ''[[East Lynne (1925 film)|East Lynne]]'' (1925) opposite [[Edmund Lowe]] and [[Lou Tellegen]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Soloman|first=Aubrey|title=Twentieth Century-Fox: A Corporate and Financial History|year=2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=0-810-84244-0|page=8}}</ref> She also had roles in ''The Gilded Butterfly'' with [[Bert Lytell]] and ''Siberia'' (both 1926), the latter of which re-teamed Rubens with Edmund Lowe and Lou Tellegen. Her final film for Fox was 1927's ''Heart of Salome'', after which she decided to work freelance.<ref name="milwaukee" />

===Drug abuse and decline===
By late 1927, Rubens' drug addiction had severely impacted her career as she was frequently admitted to sanitarium for treatment for months at a time.  One of her final roles was as Julie in the 1929 part-talkie film version of ''[[Show Boat (1929 film)|Show Boat]]'', her next-to-last film roles and one of her few sound films. The sound track for the portion in which she spoke, however, has apparently been lost.<ref>{{harv|St. Romain|2008|p=139}}</ref> 

In February 1929, Rubens' addiction became publicly known when she attempted to stab a physician who was taking her to a sanitarium for treatment. She was ordered to undergo treatment at the Spadra facility shortly thereafter. She later escaped despite being under the watch of four nurses and two male guards. She was then admitted to a sanatorium in Pasadena but left after ten days. On May 15, 1929, Rubens' husband Ricardo Cortez and her mother had Rubens committed to Patton State Hospital for treatment after she resumed her drug habit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3BcbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CEsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1132,1625667&dq=alma+rubens+arrested&hl=en|title=Film Star Goes To Insane Ward For Drug Cure|last=Hennessey|first=Duane|date=May 17, 1929|work=The Pittsburgh Press|page=29|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref> Rubens was released from the Patton State Hospital in late December 1929.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19291229&id=OpdQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tyEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5370,3750795|title=Alma Rubens Goes Back To Los Angeles|date=December 29, 1929|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=4|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref>

She made her first public appearance since her release on January 30, 1930 in role in a play produced at the Writer's Club in Hollywood. Her performance was well received by the audience and she received eight curtain calls. After the show, Rubens gave an interview to the [[United Press]] stating that she was cured of her addiction. During the interview, she described her descent into drug abuse and her experiences at the sanatoriums.<ref name="border"/> In early February 1930, Rubens traveled to New York where she announced that she was free of drug addiction and was planning comeback with a vaudeville tour in the East.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&dat=19300215&id=0PQoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CNQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3725,3227559|title="I'm Coming Back," Says Alma Rubens|date=February 15, 1930|work=The Southeast Missourian|page=2|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref> She made an appearance on stage with her husband while there, but returned to California the same month. She was there less than two weeks when, on January 5, 1931, she was arrested by Federal officers in [[San Diego]] for cocaine possession and conspiracy to smuggle morphine from Mexico into the United States.<ref>{{harv|Rubens, Rhodes, Webb|2006|p=32}}</ref> Rubens claimed she was being framed and physicians attested to her statements that she was not taking drugs.<ref name="berkeley"/> She was later released on $5,000 bail, and appeared for a preliminary hearing the second week of January 1931.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1928&dat=19310103&id=_B0gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gWYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4288,620559|title=Alma Rubens Arraigned On 3 Narcotic Charges|date=January 7, 1931|work=The Lewiston Daily Sun|page=11|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Rubens married three times. Her first marriage was to actor [[Franklyn Farnum]], nearly twenty years her senior, in June 1918. Rubens and Farnum were married secretly and separated about two months later. According to Rubens' divorce petition, Farnum physically abused her and once dislocated her jaw. Their divorce was finalized in December 1919.<ref>{{harv|Rubens, Rhodes, Webb|2006|p=4}}</ref> In November 1923, she married Dr. [[Daniel Carson Goodman]], an author and film producer. They separated in late 1924 and Rubens filed for divorce in January 1925.<ref name="milwaukee" />

Rubens third and final marriage was to actor [[Ricardo Cortez]], whom she married on January 30, 1926 in [[Riverside, California]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19260202&id=r9lPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QlQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1998,4964587|title=Says Marriage Came Too Soon|date=February 2, 1926|work=The Evening Independent|page=1|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref> As her divorce from Goodman was not yet finalized, Rubens and Cortez marriage was considered invalid. They were remarried on February 8.<ref name="milwaukee" /> While touring the [[vaudeville]] circuit in mid-1930, the couple separated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19300609&id=D6lAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9Q4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=1619,1603206|title=Divorce? Not At Present Says Alma|date=June 9, 1930|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|page=1|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref> At the time of her death, Rubens was suing Cortez for divorce. Cortez claimed he had not been notified of his wife's death, and later remarked that he had not seen her for several months and was unaware that she was seriously ill.<ref>{{harv|Slide|2010|p=63}}</ref>

==Death==
Shortly after her release from jail, Rubens contracted a cold that quickly developed into [[lobar pneumonia]] and [[bronchitis]].<ref>{{harv|Rubens, Rhodes, Webb|2006|p=35}}</ref><ref name="berkeley">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y1QiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QqcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=918,1669774&dq=alma+rubens+death&hl=en|title=Death Ends Career of Alma Rubens, Actress|date=January 22, 1931|work=Berkeley Daily Gazette|page=2|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref> She fell into a coma at the Los Angeles home of her friend, Dr. Charles J.

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Alma Rubens has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] located at 6409 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/alma-rubens/|title=Hollywood Star Walk|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Rubens' memoirs, ''This Bright World Again'', was serialized in national newspapers in 1931. The text details Rubens' career and her struggle with drug addiction.<ref name="rochester">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s4ZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iD8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3904,1192265&dq=alma+rubens+farnum&hl=en|title=My Life Story by Alma Rubens|date=March 4, 1931|work=Rochester Evening Journal|page=10|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref> The full text, along with a biography and filmography by Gary D.
