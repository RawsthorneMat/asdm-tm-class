X2.</ref> Burgess played a 17-year-old in the comedy, ''The Adorable Liar'', which was staged at the 49th Street Theater in August 1926. It was her first appearance in New York City. Burgess was ''heralded as a combination of [[Eleonora Duse]], [[Maude Adams]], [[Helen Hayes]], [[Fanny Janauschek|Janauschek]], [[Katharine Cornell]], and, possibly, [[Mrs. Fiske]].'' A reviewer commented that she proved an ''authentic success'', especially considering the material she was given.

Her knowledge of the stage was proficient and she combined this with ample charm and attractiveness.<ref>"The Adorable Liar Has Fine Exponent", ''New York Times'', August 31, 1926, p. 15.</ref> Burgess was co-featured in a stock company managed by [[George Cukor]] and George Kondolf at the Lyceum Theatre in [[Rochester, New York]], during the summer of 1928.

A9.</ref> She was typecast as a Spanish woman so much that one reviewer commented that perhaps there was a ''Spanish onion'' or a ''Mexican chili pepper'' in her family tree. However, offstage she was much more a typical ''American co-ed'' than ''the Carmanesque young ladies'', who she often played.<ref>"Dorothy Just The Type", ''Los Angeles Times'', August 9, 1931, p. 26.</ref> She made Hollywood her permanent home, living at 210 South Fuller Avenue.<ref>http://movielanddirectory.com/tour-location.cfm?location=20707</ref>
