==Career==

===Puppeteering===
Oz is known for his work as a puppeteer, performing with [[Jim Henson]]'s [[The Muppets|Muppets]]. His characters have included [[Miss Piggy]], [[Fozzie Bear]], [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]], and [[Sam Eagle]] on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', and [[Grover]], [[Cookie Monster]] and [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]] on ''[[Sesame Street]]'', Boober Fraggle on ''[[Fraggle Rock]]''.

In addition to performing a variety of characters, Oz has been one of the primary collaborators responsible for the development of the Muppets over the last 30 years. Oz has performed as a Muppet performer in over 75 productions including ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'', video releases, and [[television special]]s, as well as countless other public appearances, episodes of ''Sesame Street'', and other Jim Henson series. His puppetry work spans from 1963 to the present, though he has retired full-time from the Muppets. His Muppet characters were taken primarily over by [[Eric Jacobson]] (with [[David Rudman]] as Cookie Monster) in 2001.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-critics-notebook-voices-carry-20150515-column.html|title = If Harry Shearer leaves 'The Simpsons,' what will happen? Just ask Bugs Bunny|last = Lloyd|first = Robert|date = May 16, 2015|work = Los Angeles Times|access-date = May 20, 2015|via = }}</ref>

Oz is also known as the performer of [[Jedi]] Master [[Yoda]] from [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars]]'' series. Jim Henson had originally been contacted by Lucas about possibly performing Yoda. Henson was pre-occupied, and so Oz was assigned as chief puppeteer and as creative consultant. While other Henson alumni worked on the fabrication of Yoda, Oz performed the voice and puppet for Yoda in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]''. Oz also provided the voice of the [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) Yoda in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''. The conversion to CGI was met with some criticism among fans but Oz himself said that was "exactly what [Lucas] should have done."<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=23056 Exclusive: A Chat with Frank Oz], comingsoon.net</ref> Oz had a great deal of creative input on the character and was himself responsible for creating the character's trademark [[syntax]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002173.html

===Directing===
Inspiration as a film-maker came to Oz upon a viewing of the film ''[[Touch of Evil]]'', the director tells [[Robert K. Elder]] in an interview for ''[[The Film That Changed My Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556528256/ref=nosim/wwwrobelderco-20 |title=The Film That Changed My Life: 30 Directors on Their Epiphanies in the Dark (9781556528255): Robert K. Elder: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-26}}</ref>

<blockquote>I think it opened up my view of film—that there’s so much more that could be done. Actually, by breaking so many rules, he allowed other people to say, “Hey, I can maybe think of some stuff, too!” He just opened up the possibilities more for me. That’s what he did.<ref>Oz, Frank. Interview by Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life. By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p. 272. Print.</ref></blockquote>

[[File:Frank Oz - 1984.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Oz in 1984]]
Oz began his behind-the-camera work when he co-directed the fantasy film ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'' with long-time collaborator [[Jim Henson]]. The film featured the most advanced puppets ever created for a movie. Oz further employed those skills in directing 1984's ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'', as well as sharing a screenwriting credit.

In 1986 he directed his first movie that did not involve Henson, ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop Of Horrors]]''. The musical film starred [[Rick Moranis]] and [[Ellen Greene]], as well as [[Vincent Gardenia]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Bill Murray]], [[John Candy]], [[Christopher Guest]], [[Jim Belushi]] and a 15-foot-tall talking plant (voiced by [[Levi Stubbs]]) which at times required up to 40 puppeteers to operate. The film allowed Oz to show his ability to work with live actors, and led to opportunities to direct films that did not include puppetry.

Usually directing comedies, Oz went on to direct ''[[Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (film)|Dirty Rotten Scoundrels]]'' in 1988, starring Steve Martin and [[Michael Caine]], ''[[What About Bob?]]'' in 1991, starring Bill Murray and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], and ''[[Housesitter (film)|Housesitter]]'' in 1992, starring Steve Martin and [[Goldie Hawn]] (all of which were scored by [[Miles Goodman]]). Later films include ''[[The Indian in the Cupboard (film)|The Indian in the Cupboard]]'' (1995), ''[[In & Out]]'' (1997), ''[[Bowfinger]]'' (1999), ''[[The Score (2001 film)|The Score]]'' (2001), the 2004 remake of ''[[The Stepford Wives (2004 film)|The Stepford Wives]]'', and the original ''[[Death at a Funeral (2007 film)|Death at a Funeral]]'' (2007).

Oz has frequently experienced on-set tension while directing his films, notably during the productions of ''What About Bob?'', ''The Score'' and ''The Stepford Wives''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Plume|first=Kenneth|title=INTERVIEW WITH FRANK OZ|date=10 February 2000|publisher=[[IGN]]|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/10/interview-with-frank-oz-part-3-of-4|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/frank-oz.s-tense-remake|title=Nicole Kidman-Frank Oz's Tense Remake |publisher=contactmusic.com |date=2003-02-10}}</ref>

===Acting===
As an actor, Oz appeared in a bit part as Prison Storeroom Keeper in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), directed by [[John Landis]]. He also appeared in later Landis movies ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'', ''[[Spies Like Us]]'', ''[[Trading Places]]'' and ''[[Innocent Blood (film)|Innocent Blood]]''. In 1998, Oz portrayed a warden in ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''. In 2001 he had a minor part in the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' as Randall's scare assistant, Fungus.<ref>{{cite news|last=Paquette|first=Danielle|title=Frank Oz speaks — but not as Yoda or Miss Piggy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/26/entertainment/la-et-mn-frank-oz-yoda-miss-piggy-20120726|accessdate=4 February 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=12 July 2012}}</ref> In 2005, he had a minor part in the Columbia film ''[[Zathura]]'' as the voice of the Robot.

Other cameos have included playing a surgeon in scenes cut from the theatrical release of ''[[Superman III]]'',<ref>{{cite web

Even if he does not appear in a Landis movie, his name is often spoken in the background. During airport scenes in ''[[Into the Night (film)|Into the Night]]'' and ''[[Coming to America]]'', there are announcements on the PA system for 'Mr. Frank Oznowicz'.
