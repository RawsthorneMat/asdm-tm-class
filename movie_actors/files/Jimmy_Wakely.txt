'''James Clarence "Jimmy" Wakely''' (February 16, 1914 - September 23, 1982),<ref name="IMDB43">{{cite web|last=Wakely|first=Jimmy|title=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0906843|accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref> was an American actor and [[Country music|country Western]] music vocalist, and one of the last [[singing cowboy]]s. During the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, he released records, appeared in several B-[[Western movies]] with most of the major studios, appeared on radio and television and even had his own series of comic books. His duet singles with [[Margaret Whiting]] from 1949&ndash;51 produced a string of top seven hits, including 1949's number one hit on the US country charts and pop music charts, "[[Slippin' Around]]." Wakely owned two [[music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]] companies in later years and performed at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] until shortly before his death.

==Biography==

===Early years===
James Clarence Wakeley was born in [[Howard County, Arkansas]] but his family moved to [[Rosedale, Oklahoma]] by 1920. As a teenager, he changed his surname to Wakely, dropping the second "e".<ref name="B-WEST">{{cite web|last=Wakely|first=Jimmy|title=B-Westerns|url=http://www.b-westerns.com/wakely0.htm|accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref>

===Country Western musician===
In 1937 in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]] he formed The Bell Boys, a country Western singing group named after their Bell Clothing sponsor. The group performed locally, made some recordings, and did frequent radio broadcasts over Oklahoma City's [[WKY]]. [[Johnny Bond]], Dick Reinhart, Scotty Harrell and Jack Cheney were members of the Bell Boys and later groups.<ref name="B-WEST"/> Over time, Wakely's groups were known as The Jimmy Wakely Trio, Jimmy Wakely and His Saddle Pals, Jimmy Wakely Trio and James Wakely.<ref name="IMDB43"/>

During a tour through Oklahoma, Western movie star [[Gene Autry]] invited Wakely to come to California. Autry felt the group might be a good addition to his new ''[[Gene Autry's Melody Ranch|Melody Ranch]]'' radio show which debuted on [[CBS]] in January 1940. The Wakely Trio joined the show in mid-1940. He stayed for a couple of years, then left because of movie commitments and a recording contract with Decca Records that ran from 1941&ndash;1942 through 1947. Johnny Bond stayed with the show for most of its run (the show left the air in 1956).<ref name="B-WEST"/>

===Personal life===
Wakely married Dora Inez Miser on [[Friday the 13th]], December 13, 1935. They had four children: Deanna, Carol, Linda and son Johnny. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1982.<ref name="B-WEST"/>

===Western movie actor===
In 1939, Wakely made his screen debut (with the Jimmy Wakely Trio) in a [[Roy Rogers]] Western, ''Saga of Death Valley''.<ref name="AllMovies">{{cite web
| last       = Wakely
| first      = Jimmy

| accessdate = 2007-12-08 }}</ref> In the 1940s, Wakely groups provided songs and musical support for several B-western movies, including appearances with:
*the Range Busters at [[Monogram Pictures]]
*[[Don "Red" Barry]] at [[Republic Pictures]]
*[[Johnny Mack Brown]] and [[Tex Ritter]] at [[Universal Pictures]]
*[[Charles Starrett]] at [[Columbia Pictures]]
*[[William Boyd (actor)|Hopalong Cassidy]] at [[Paramount Pictures]]
Wakely made only one film with Autry, ''Heart of the Rio Grande'', at Republic in 1942.<ref name="B-WEST"/> He was sometimes referred to as a low-budget Autry in films. His response was, "Everybody reminds somebody of someone else until they are somebody. And I had rather be compared to Gene Autry than anyone else. Through the grace of God and Gene Autry, I got a career."<ref name="AllMovies"/> He appeared in 28 Westerns at Monogram between 1944 and 1949.<ref name="B-WEST"/><ref name="AllMovies"/>

Wakely also appeared in some non-Westerns, including ''I'm from Arkansas'' in 1944, a showcase for country and hillbilly performers who bring their comedy, tunes and yodeling to Pitchfork, Arkansas.<ref name="B-WEST"/>

===Recording career===
About 1941&ndash;1942, Decca gave Wakeley a recording contract that ran until 1947.<ref name="B-WEST"/> After leaving films, he continued to record, switching to the Columbia label. Though most of his songs were country Western, some crossed over to the pop charts, including collaborations with singer [[Margaret Whiting]] and [[Karen Chandler]], and for the Christmas song "Silver Bells".<ref name="AllMovies"/> He had a number one country hit with "[[One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)]]", a song originally released by Western singer [[Eddie Dean (singer)|Eddie Dean]].

===Comic books===
Like other Western film stars of the era, Wakely had his own comic book series. [[DC Comics]] published 18 issues from Sept/Oct 1949&ndash;July/Aug 1952, billing him as "HOLLYWOOD'S SENSATIONAL COWBOY STAR!"<ref name="B-WEST"/><ref name="AllMovies"/>

===Radio and television appearances===
In addition to Autry's ''Melody Ranch'', Wakely had his own CBS Radio show and co-hosted other programs. He also made several appearances on television variety shows;<ref name="B-WEST"/> and in 1961 he was one of five rotating hosts on the NBC-TV program ''[[Five Star Jubilee]]''.

He also had one of the last live network radio programs at the NBC radio studios at the corner of Sunset and Vine in Hollywood, California in 1958.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  Excerpts of the program appear on Wakely's albums and CDs.

===Recording company===
In the 1960s and 1970s, Wakely developed Shasta Records and owned two music publishing companies. He converted part of his California ranch into a recording studio, producing recordings for himself as well as for other country Western performers, including [[Tex Williams]], [[Merle Travis]], Eddie Dean, [[Tex Ritter]] and [[Rex Allen]].<ref name="IMDB43"/><ref name="B-WEST"/> For his recording work, Wakely has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on Vine Street.<ref name="HWOF">{{cite web|last=Wakely|first=Jimmy|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame Directory|url=http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/icons/walk_directory.asp

===Later years===
Later in life, Wakely performed at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and ''[[National Barn Dance]].'' His nightclub act visited [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] and other venues. He did a Christmas USO Tour with [[Bob Hope]]. He made a few recordings on the [[Coral Records|Coral]], Decca/Vocalion and [[Dot Records|Dot]] labels. He made appearances at Western film nostalgia conventions and continued personal appearances and stage shows, often with his daughter Linda and son Johnny in the act.<ref name="B-WEST"/>

===Death===
After contracting [[emphysema]], Wakely died of [[heart failure]] at [[Mission Hills, California]] on September 23, 1982.<ref name="IMDB43"/> He and his wife, who died in 1997, are interred next to each other in the Court of Remembrance at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)]], [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref name="B-WEST"/>
