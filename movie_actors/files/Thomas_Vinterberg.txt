'''Thomas Vinterberg''' (born 19 May 1969) is a Danish film director who, along with [[Lars von Trier]], co-founded the [[Dogme 95]] movement in [[filmmaking]], which established rules for simplifying movie production.

==Life and career==
Vinterberg was born in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. In 1993, he graduated from the [[National Film School of Denmark]] with ''Last Round'' (''Sidste Omgang''), which won the jury and producers' awards at the [[Munich International Festival of Film Schools]], and First Prize at [[Tel Aviv]]. That year Vinterberg made his first TV drama for [[Danmarks Radio|DR TV]] and his short fiction film [[The Boy Who Walked Backwards]], produced by [[Birgitte Hald]] at [[Nimbus Film]].

This film has won awards and accolades all over the world, including Nordic Panorama in Iceland, the [[Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival|International Short Film Festival]] in [[Clermont-Ferrand]], and the [[Toronto Film Festival]].

His first feature film was ''[[The Biggest Heroes]]'' (''De Største Helte''), a road movie that received acclaim in his native [[Denmark]].

In 1995 Vinterberg formed the [[Dogme 95]] movement with [[Lars von Trier]],  [[Kristian Levring]], and [[Søren Kragh-Jacobsen]].

Following that dogma in 1998, he conceived, wrote and directed (and also had a small acting role in) the first of the Dogme movies, ''[[The Celebration]]'' (''Festen'').  As per the rules of the Dogme manifesto, he did not take a directorial credit and [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] has the film listed with no director.  However, he and the film won numerous nominations and awards, including the Jury Prize at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4907/year/1998.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Celebration |accessdate=2009-09-29|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>

In 2003 he directed the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction|apocalyptic science fiction]] love story ''[[It's All About Love]]'', a movie he wrote, directed and produced himself over a period of five years. This movie was entirely in English and featured, among others, [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Claire Danes]], and [[Sean Penn]]. The movie did not do well, as critics and audiences found it idiosyncratic and somewhat incomprehensible.

His next film, the English-language ''[[Dear Wendy]]'' (2005), scripted by [[Lars von Trier]], also flopped, even in his native Denmark where it sold only 14,521 tickets.<ref>http://www.dfi.dk/talogstatistik/biograftal/biotal2006/biotal2006_2.htm</ref> However he won the Silver George for Best Director at the [[27th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name="Moscow2005">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=2005 |title=27th Moscow International Film Festival (2005) |accessdate=2013-04-13 |work=MIFF}}</ref> Vinterberg then tried to retrace his roots with a smaller Danish-language production, ''[[En mand kommer hjem]]'' (2007), which also flopped, selling only 31,232 tickets.<ref>http://www.dfi.dk/talogstatistik/biograftal/biotal/biotal.htm</ref>

On 1 August 2008 he directed the music video for "[[The Day That Never Comes]]", the first single off [[Metallica|Metallica's]] album ''[[Death Magnetic]]''.

His 2010 film ''[[Submarino]]'' was nominated for the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale 2010">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2010/02_programm_2010/02_Programm_2010.html |title=60th Berlin International Film Festival: Programme |accessdate=2010-10-16 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

In 2012, his film ''[[The Hunt (2012 film)|The Hunt]]'' competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name="Official Selection">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/58878.html |title=2012 Official Selection |accessdate=2012-04-25 |work=Cannes}}</ref><ref name="timeout">{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2547/cannes-film-festival-2012-line-up-announced |title=Cannes Film Festival 2012 line-up announced |accessdate=2012-04-25 |work=timeout}}</ref> and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film award]] at the [[86th Academy Awards]].

In 2015 he released "[[Far From The Madding Crowd (2015 film)|Far From The Madding Crowd]]" an adaptation of the acclaimed [[Thomas Hardy]] novel
