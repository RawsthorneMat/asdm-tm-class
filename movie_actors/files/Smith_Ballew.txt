'''Smith Ballew''' (real name '''Sykes Ballew''') (January 21, 1902 &ndash; May 2, 1984) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], sophisticated [[singing|singer]], [[orchestra]] leader, and a western singing star.

He was born in [[Palestine, Texas]]. He attended high school in [[Sherman, Texas|Sherman]] and college at [[Austin College]] and the [[University of Texas]]. He began his singing career on the [[radio]], and in the 1930s became one of the earliest of the [[singing cowboy]]s on the movie screen. He did a series of musical Westerns for [[Paramount Pictures]] and one for [[20th Century Fox]], continuing in supporting roles until the 1950s.

Prior to his singing cowboy career, starting in the late 1920s, he became one of the most recognizable vocalists on hundreds of dance band and jazz records. During this time, Ballew along with [[Scrappy Lambert]], Dick Robertson, and [[Chick Bullock]] were the most prolific studio vocalists. He organized his own short-lived band in 1931.

Between 1929 and 1935, he made scores of records issued under his own name for [[OKeh Records|OKeh]], the dime store labels ([[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records|Domino]], [[Jewel Records (New York record label)|Jewel]], [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Perfect Records|Perfect]], [[Oriole Records (U.S.)|Oriole]] as Buddy Blue & His Texans or Jack Blue's Texans), [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], and [[Crown Records|Crown]].  Few of these popular records gave any indication of his future Cowboy style.

He died at the age of 82 in [[Longview, Texas]].
