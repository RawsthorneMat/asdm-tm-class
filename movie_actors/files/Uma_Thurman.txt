'''Uma Karuna Thurman''' (born April 29, 1970)<ref name=filmref>{{cite web | url = http://www.filmreference.com/Actors-and-Actresses-Str-Us/Thurman-Uma.html | title=Thurman, Uma | publisher=FilmReference.com | accessdate= April 22, 2014}}</ref> is an American actress and model. She has performed in leading roles in a variety of films, ranging from romantic comedies and dramas to [[science fiction]] and [[Action film|action movies]]. Following early roles in films such as ''[[Dangerous Liaisons]]'' (1988), she rose to international prominence in 1994 following her role in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' for which she was nominated for an [[Academy Award]], a [[BAFTA Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]]. She starred in several more films  throughout the 1990s such as ''[[The Truth About Cats & Dogs]]'', ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', ''[[Gattaca]]'' and ''[[Les Misérables (1998 film)|Les Misérables]]''.

She won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for the miniseries ''[[Hysterical Blindness (film)|Hysterical Blindness]]'' (2002). Her career was revitalized when she reunited with director Quentin Tarantino to play the main role in both ''[[Kill Bill]]'' films (2003/2004) which brought her an additional two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations with a [[BAFTA Award]] nomination.

== Career ==

=== 1985–89: early work ===
Thurman began her career as a fashion model at age 15,<ref>"Uma on Men, Movies and Motherhood", ''Harper's Bazaar'', March 1998.</ref> and signed with the agency Click Models. Her early modeling credits included ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' and the December 1985 and May 1986 covers of British ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.<ref name=biochannel>[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/882:1170/1/Uma_Thurman.htm "Uma Thurman Biography"]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}, Biography Channel, Retrieved October 18, 2011.</ref><!-- Unsourced: In 1989, she appeared on the cover of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's annual ''Hot issue''.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/photos/gallery/5392231/1989_rolling_stone_covers/photo/9/medium Rolling Stone cover archive], ''Rolling Stone'', accessed August 16, 2010.</ref>--> She made her movie debut in 1988, appearing in four films that year. Her first two were the high school comedy ''[[Johnny Be Good]]'' and teen thriller ''[[Kiss Daddy Goodnight]]''. She had a small role in ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', playing the goddess Venus alongside [[Oliver Reed]]'s Vulcan; during her entrance she briefly appears nude, in an homage to [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]''. The most acclaimed of these first four films was Oscar-winning drama ''[[Dangerous Liaisons]]'', in which Thurman's character of Cecile de Volanges is seduced by the manipulative Vicomte de Valmont ([[John Malkovich]]). At the time, insecure about her appearance, she spent roughly a year in London, during which she often wore loose, baggy clothing.<ref name=biochannel/> Malkovich said of her, "There is nothing twitchy teenager-ish about her, I haven’t met anyone like her at that age. Her intelligence and poise stand out. But there's something else. She's more than a little haunted."<ref>{{"'}}Dangerous Liaisons' violated beauty, Uma Thurman, 18, is a little risky herself", ''People Weekly'', February 6, 1989.</ref>

=== 1990–93: career prominence ===
In 1990, Thurman appeared with [[Fred Ward]] and [[Maria de Medeiros]] in the sexually provocative drama ''[[Henry & June]]'', the first film to receive an [[NC-17]] rating. Partly because many American newspapers refused to advertise films with the new rating, it did not get wide release in the United States, but the film won her some good notices. ''The New York Times'' wrote: "Thurman, as the Brooklyn-accented June, takes a larger-than-life character and makes her even bigger, though the performance is often as curious as it is commanding."<ref>Maslin, Janet. "A Writer’s Awakening to the Erotic," ''The New York Times'', October 5, 1990.</ref>

In 1993, she was for the first time the main star in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|1993 adaptation]] of [[Tom Robbins]]' novel ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]''. It was a critical and financial disappointment; Thurman was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Awards|Worst Actress Razzie]]. ''The Washington Post'' described her acting as shallow, writing that, "Thurman's strangely passive characterization doesn't go much deeper than drawling and flexing her prosthetic thumbs".<ref>Brown, Joe. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/evencowgirlsgetthebluesrbrown_a0ae18.htm "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues"], ''The Washington Post'', May 20, 1994.</ref> She also starred opposite [[Robert De Niro]] in the drama ''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]'', a box office disappointment that received positive reviews. Later that year, Thurman auditioned for [[Stanley Kubrick]] while he was casting for his eventually unrealized project [[Wartime Lies#Film Adaptions|Wartime Lies]].<ref>{{cite web

=== 1994–98: continued success ===
After ''Mad Dog and Glory'', Thurman auditioned for the [[Quentin Tarantino]] movie ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', which grossed over $107 million on a budget of only $8 million.<ref>[http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pulpfiction.htm ''Pulp Fiction''], Box Office Mojo, accessed August 16, 2010.</ref> The ''Washington Post'' wrote that Thurman was "serenely unrecognizable in a black wig, [and] is marvelous as a zoned-out gangster's girlfriend."<ref>Desson Howe. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/pulpfictionrhowe_a01b66.htm "Pulp Fiction"], ''The Washington Post'', October 14, 1994.</ref> Thurman was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress Oscar]] the following year. She became one of Tarantino's favorite actresses to cast; he told ''Time'' magazine in 2003 that she was "up there with [[Greta Garbo|Garbo]] and [[Marlene Dietrich|Dietrich]] in goddess territory."<ref name=Tyrangiel>[[Josh Tyrangiel|Tyrangiel, Josh]]. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101030929-488846,00.html ''The Tao of Uma''], ''Time'', September 22, 2003.</ref>

1996 would see Thurman in two moderately successful films, the first of which was ''[[Beautiful Girls (film)|Beautiful Girls]]'', where she played the female lead and love interest of [[Timothy Hutton]] and was supported with a high-profile cast (for that time) of [[Mira Sorvino]], [[Martha Plimpton]], and [[Natalie Portman]]. The film was well received by the critics for the script and acting, particularly that of Hutton and Portman. It performed moderately well at the box office. Thurman also starred opposite [[Janeane Garofalo]] in the moderately successful 1996 romantic comedy ''[[The Truth About Cats & Dogs]]'' as a ditzy blonde model. In 1997, she starred opposite her future husband [[Ethan Hawke]] in the science fiction film ''[[Gattaca]]''. Although ''Gattaca'' was not a success at the box office, it drew many positive reviews and became successful on the home video market.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080408081621/http://www.crazy4cinema.com/Review/FilmsG/f_gattaca.html "Gattaca"], Crazy for Cinema, accessed August 16, 2010.</ref> Some critics were not as impressed with Thurman, such as ''The Los Angeles Times'', which wrote that she was "as emotionally uninvolved as ever."<ref>Mathews, Jack. [http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie971111-26,0,7913577.story "Cautionary Tale in Genetically Pure 'Gattaca'"], ''The Los Angeles Times'', October 24, 1997.</ref>

Her next role was [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] in ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]'', the fourth of the series. Her performance received mixed reviews, and critics compared her to [[Mae West]]. ''The New York Times'' wrote, "like Mae West, she mixes true femininity with the winking womanliness of a drag queen."<ref>Maslin, Janet. [http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/batman-film-review.html ''Batman and Robin''], ''The New York Times'', June 20, 1997.</ref> A similar comparison was made by the ''Houston Chronicle'': "Thurman, to arrive at a '40s femme fatale, sometimes seems to be doing Mae West by way of [[Jessica Rabbit]]."<ref>Millar, Jeff. [http://web.archive.org/web/20080327075450/http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story/content/chronicle/features/97/06/20/batman-1.0-1.html "If you like them busy, this 'Batman' is for you"], ''Houston Chronicle'', June 19, 1997.</ref> The next year brought ''[[The Avengers (1998 film)|The Avengers]]'', another major financial and critical flop. CNN described her as "so distanced you feel like you’re watching her through the wrong end of a telescope."<ref>Tatara, Paul. [http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Movies/9808/21/review.avengers/index.html "Review: 'The Avengers' is retro-boring"], CNN, August 21, 1998.</ref> She received Razzie Award nominations for both films. She closed out 1998 with ''[[Les Misérables (1998 film)|Les Misérables]]'', a film version of [[Victor Hugo]]'s [[Les Miserables|novel of the same name]], directed by [[Bille August]], in which she played [[Fantine]]. On his review of the film, [[Roger Ebert]] said that "Thurman's performance is the best element of the movie."

=== 1998–2002: hiatus ===
After the birth of her first child in 1998, Thurman took a break from acting to concentrate on motherhood. Her next roles were in low-budget and television films, including ''[[Vatel (film)|Vatel]]'', ''[[Tape (film)|Tape]]'', in which she appeared with then husband [[Ethan Hawke]] and for which she was nominated for the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female]], and ''[[Chelsea Walls]]'', directed by Hawke.

She would win a Golden Globe award for her acting in [[HBO]] cable movie ''[[Hysterical Blindness (movie)|Hysterical Blindness]]''; she was also one of the executive producers. Thurman played a New Jersey woman in the 1980s searching for romance. The ''San Francisco Chronicle'' review said, "Thurman so commits herself to the role, eyes blazing and body akimbo, that you start to believe that such a creature could exist—an exquisite-looking woman so spastic and needy that she repulses regular Joes. Thurman has bent the role to her will."<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/08/23/DD7591.DTL "A repulsive beauty in '80s Jersey Thurman's histrionics fit 'Hysterical Blindness' well"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', August 23, 2002.</ref>

In 2000, she narrated the [[John Moran (composer)|John Moran]] opera ''Book of the Dead (2nd Avenue)'' at New York's Public Theater.

=== 2003–present ===
In 2003 Thurman co-starred in [[John Woo]]'s ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'', which was only moderately successful with critics and at the box office.

It would be Quentin Tarantino's ''[[Kill Bill]]'' which relaunched her career. She played assassin [[Beatrix Kiddo]], out for revenge against her former lover. Tarantino wrote the part specifically for her. He cited Thurman as his [[muse]] while writing the film, and gave her joint credit for the character, whom the two conceived on the set of ''Pulp Fiction'' from the sole image of a bride covered in blood. Production was delayed for several months after Thurman became pregnant and Tarantino refused to recast the part.<ref name="killbilldvd">Kill Bill Vol. 1, DVD bonus featurette</ref> The film took nine months to shoot, and was filmed in five different countries. The role was also her most demanding, and she spent three months training in [[martial arts]], [[swordsmanship]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref>Malanowski, Jamie. "Catching up with Uma Thurman," ''USA Today'', October 5, 2003.</ref> It was originally set to be released as one film. However due to its over 4-hour running time, it was ultimately released in two parts and became a cult classic<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=killbill.htm "Kill Bill"], Boxofficemojo.com, accessed August 16, 2010.</ref> and scored highly with critics. Thurman was nominated for a Golden Globe for both entries, plus three [[MTV Movie Award]]s for Best Female Performance and two for Best Fight. ''Rolling Stone'' likened her to "an avenging angel out of a 1940s Hollywood melodrama".<ref>Dana, Will. [http://web.archive.org/web/20080130074538rn_1/www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948643/kill_bill_vol_2 "Kill Bill Vol. 2 review"], ''Rolling Stone'', July 28, 2004.</ref>

[[File:File-Uma Thurman at the Tribeca Film Festival 4.jpg|upright|left|thumb|At the 2009 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] ]]
The inspirations for The Bride were several [[B-movie]] action heroines. Thurman's main inspiration for the role was the title character of ''[[Coffy]]'' (played by [[Pam Grier]]) and the character of Gloria Swenson from ''[[Gloria (1980 film)|Gloria]]'' (played by [[Gena Rowlands]]). She said that the two characters are "two of the only women I've ever seen be truly women [while] holding a weapon".<ref>Downey, Ryan J. [http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1488333/06102004/story.jhtml "What Made Kill Bill"], MTV News, June 11, 2004.</ref> ''Coffy'' was screened for Thurman by Tarantino prior to beginning production on the film, to help her model the character.<ref name="killbilldvd" />

By 2005, Thurman was commanding a salary of $12.5 million per film. Her first film of the year was ''[[Be Cool]]'', the sequel to 1995's ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'', which reunited her with her ''Pulp Fiction'' castmate [[John Travolta]]. In the film, she played the widow of a deceased music business executive. The film received poor reviews, and came in below expectations at the box office. In 2005, she starred in ''[[Prime (film)|Prime]]'' with [[Meryl Streep]], playing a woman in her late thirties romancing a man in his early twenties. Thurman's last film of the year was a remake of ''[[The Producers (2005 film)|The Producers]]'' in which she played [[Ulla (The Producers)|Ulla]], a Swedish stage actress hoping to win a part in a new [[Broadway musical]]. Originally, the producers of the film planned to have another singer dub in Thurman's musical numbers, but she was eager to do her own vocals.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2005-04-01#celeb8 WENN daily news], IMDb, April 1, 2005.</ref> She is credited for her songs in the credits. The film was considered a bomb at the box office, but many praised Thurman's efforts, including [[A. O. Scott]] of ''The New York Times'' who said: "Uma Thurman as a would-be actress is the one bit of genuine radiance in this aggressively and pointlessly shiny, noisy spectacle."<ref>Scott, A.O.

With a successful film career, Thurman once again became a desired model. Cosmetics company [[Lancôme]] selected her as its spokeswoman. It also named several shades of lipstick after her, though they were sold only in Asia. In 2005, Thurman became a spokeswoman for the French fashion house [[Louis Vuitton]]. On February 7, 2006, she was also named a knight of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] of France for outstanding achievement in the field of art and literature.

In May 2006, Thurman bought the film rights to the [[Frank Schätzing]] novel ''[[The Swarm (novel)|The Swarm]]'', which is in development and due for release in 2015.<ref>[http://imdb.com/title/tt0808491/ "The Swarm (2011)"], IMDb, April 25, 2010.</ref> When the film remake ''[[The Women (2008 film)|The Women]]'' was in pre-production in 2006, Thurman was cast as Crystal Allen, alongside [[Annette Bening]], [[Julia Roberts]], [[Meg Ryan]], [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Lisa Kudrow]] and [[Anne Hathaway]], being directed by [[James L. Brooks]], but the director was changed and Thurman was no longer part of the cast.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In July 2006, she starred opposite [[Luke Wilson]] in ''[[My Super Ex-Girlfriend]]''. Thurman portrayed a superhero named "G-Girl" who is dumped by her boyfriend and then takes her revenge upon him. She received $14 million for the role,{{fact|date=May 2015}} but the film flopped. Once again she was well-received, but the film was not.{{fact|date=May 2015}}

In February 2008, she starred opposite Colin Firth and Jeffrey Dean Morgan in ''[[The Accidental Husband]]'', a romantic comedy about a woman who finds herself married while engaged to another man. It seems like archetypal Hollywood contrivance, but according to Thurman, a similar situation happened in New York.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080304035715/http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms:/out/films/video_interviews/uma_thurman_accidental_husband_interview "Uma Thurman: A Decent Proposal"], STV, February 27, 2008.</ref> Also in 2008, she starred as Elsa in the British film ''[[My Zinc Bed (film)|My Zinc Bed]]'', in which she plays a cocaine addict, starring opposite [[Paddy Considine]] and [[Jonathan Pryce]].
