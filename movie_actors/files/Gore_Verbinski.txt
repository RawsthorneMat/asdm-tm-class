In 1967 the Verbinski family moved to [[Southern California]], where a young Gregor grew up in the town of La Jolla. Gregor was an active [[Boy Scout]] and [[surfing|surfed]] regularly. He went to Torrey Pines Elementary, Muirlands Junior High, and La Jolla High School (Class of 1982<ref>La Jolla High yearbook</ref>) before attending UCLA Film School. Verbinski graduated with his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] in Film from [[UCLA]] in 1987. He is the father of two boys, Anton and Ivan.-->

==Music career==
Verbinski was active in several L.A.&nbsp;rock bands early in his career. He played in the [[Daredevils (band)|Daredevils]], ''Bulldozer'', ''The Drivers'', and the all-star band ''The Cylon Boys Choir''. He was also in a band called ''The Little Kings'', which backed [[Stiv Bators]] on his version of "[[Have Love Will Travel]]" with legendary drummer Chris Poobah Bailey. Along with a cover of the [[Moody Blues]] song "[[The Story in Your Eyes]]" (by other musicians), the song was released by Bators in the Fall of 1986 as a 12-inch single on [[Bomp! Records|Bomp!]] (catalogue #12136) and was later included in Bators' compilation album ''[[L.A. L.A.]]'' On the compilation album's liner notes, label owner [[Greg Shaw]] described the band as "an adequate but rootless Hollywood [[glam rock|glam]]-damaged band with tattoos".

==Film career==
His first films were a series of 8&nbsp;mm films called "The Driver Files" c. 1979, when he was a young teen. He started his career directing music videos for bands like [[Vicious Rumors]], [[Bad Religion]], [[NOFX]], [[24-7 Spyz]] and [[Monster Magnet]] working at Palomar Pictures. Verbinski moved from music videos to commercials, where he worked for many brand names including [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Skittles (confectionery)|Skittles]] and [[United Airlines]]. One of his most famous commercials was for [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], featuring frogs who croak the brand name. For his efforts in commercials, Verbinski won four [[Clio Awards]] and one [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival|Cannes Advertising]] Silver Lion.

After completing a short film, ''The Ritual'' (which he both wrote and directed), Verbinski made his feature film directing debut with ''[[MouseHunt (film)|Mouse Hunt]]''. The film was a hit globally and he soon followed up the success with the action/comedy ''[[The Mexican]]'', starring [[Julia Roberts]] and [[Brad Pitt]]. The film received mixed reviews, and performed modestly at the box-office, earning $68 million domestically which was quite meager considering its star power (it was technically successful due to its moderately low $38 million budget). Verbinski followed it up with the horror film remake ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' (2002), which struck gold globally, grossing well over $200 million worldwide. Verbinski also had a directorial hand in ''[[The Time Machine (2002 film)|The Time Machine]]'' that year, temporarily taking over for an exhausted [[Simon Wells]].{{cn|date=June 2013}} Verbinski directed some of the underground Morlock sequences{{cn|date=June 2013}} and is given a ''Thanks to'' credit in the film.

He then directed the very successful ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' which earned over $600 million at the international box office. This was his first collaboration with producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]], whom he has since collaborated with on several other movies. His next film was ''[[The Weather Man]]'', which starred [[Nicolas Cage]]. The film received mixed to positive reviews but was a box office failure. In March 2005, he started filming the sequels ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''. The former then became his biggest success so far, becoming the third film ever to gross over $1 billion at the international box office.  Verbinski was also set to direct a film for Universal based on the video game ''[[BioShock]]''.<ref>[http://weblogs.variety.com/the_cut_scene/2008/05/gore-verbinski.html The Cut Scene – Video Game Blog by Variety: Gore Verbinski talks about directing the Bioshock movie]. Weblogs.variety.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-31.</ref> Verbinski was then replaced by [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]] as director and the film was subsequently cancelled.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-12-ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why | title = Ken Levine personally killed off the BioShock film – here's why | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date = 2013-03-12 | accessdate = 2013-03-12 | first = Martin | last = Robinson }}</ref> 

In 2011 and 2013, Verbinski would delve into the Western genre, with decidedly different results: [[Rango (2011 film)|''Rango'']] was well received, critically and commercially, and earned the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. However, his adaptation of the 1930s radio hero, [[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|''The Lone Ranger'']] for Disney, was not, the project having been stuck in development hell for several years, undergone rewrites and budget cuts,<ref name="Variety1" /><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/08/13/disney-halts-johnny-depp-lone-ranger |title=Disney halts Johnny Depp's 'Lone Ranger' |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=August 13, 2011 |first=Dave |last=Karger |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}</ref> and gained controversy for the casting of [[Johnny Depp]] as the Native American [[Tonto]]. The film grossed $260 million against a $215-225 million budget, plus an estimated $150-160 million marketing campaign.<ref name="Variety1">{{cite news|last=Graser|first=Marc|title=Disney, Bruckheimer See ‘Lone Ranger’ as New Genre-Bending Superhero|url=http://variety.com/2013/film/news/disney-bruckheimer-see-lone-ranger-as-new-genre-bending-superhero-1200501501/|accessdate=26 June 2013|newspaper=Variety|date=25 June 2013|quote=The picture cost approximately $250 million to produce, and more than $150 million to market and distribute around the globe ...

He has been announced to produce and direct a remake of the film ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'', based on the [[Cluedo|board game]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=Michael Fleming |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000533.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Gore Verbinski to develop 'Clue' |publisher=Variety |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}</ref> His future project will be an adaption of [[William Monahan]]'s novel ''[[Light House: A Trifle]]'', which is a story about an artist running away from the Mafia who hides in a lighthouse, in which kooky characters live. He will also direct ''Butterfly'', a [[psychological thriller]] about a man trying to drive his wife insane. [[Steve Carell]] is set to star in it.

==Other projects==
Verbinski was involved with ''[[Matter (video game)|Matter]]'', an original futuristic videogame that was being developed for the [[Xbox 360]] using [[Kinect]]. Announced at [[E3 2012]], Verbinski later confirmed that the game is now cancelled.
