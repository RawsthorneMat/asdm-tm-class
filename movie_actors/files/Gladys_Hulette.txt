'''Gladys Hulette''' (July 21, 1896 â€“ August 8, 1991) was a [[silent film]] actress from [[Arcade, New York]]. Her career began in the early years of silent movies and continued until the mid-1930s. She first performed on stage at the age of three and on screen when she was seven years old. Hulette was also a talented artist. Her mother was an opera star.

==Child Actress==

Hulette was among the principal players in ''Sappho and Phaon'' which had its first performance in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] on October 4, 1907. She helped support [[Bertha Kalich]] in the [[Percy MacKaye]] production. As a child she also appeared in ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1908) and ''The Smoke Fairy'' (1909). On stage, in ''Blue Bird'', she played ''the wonder child''. She was the sweet youth, ''Beth'', in ''[[Little Women]]'' by [[Louisa May Alcott]].

In her earliest motion picture features she was under contract to [[Vitagraph Studios]]. There was a stigma for [[Broadway theater]] actors to be seen in motion pictures when silent films first began to be made. Hulette later discussed this, saying ''the picture heroes were mostly [[Coney Island]] life savers.'' One company prevailed upon a leading stage actor to play the role of ''Hamlet'' on screen. This began the influx of more Broadway actors into the new medium.

By 1917 Hulette's films were being produced by leading director William Parke. In that year she made her most popular film to date, ''Streets of Illusion''. Playing the part of ''Beam'', Hulette's co-stars included [[Richard Barthelmess]] and J.H. Gilmour. Parke owned theatrical companies and assisted Hulette in making one hit after another.

She married William Parke Jr., the director's son in 1917.  They divorced in 1924

By 1921 she was a veteran of the motion picture industry. She again played opposite Barthelmess, this time in ''[[Tol'able David]]''.  She played the [[ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] part of ''Esther Hatburn''. In an interview she said she wished for no different type of roles than the one she played in this film. Later she sought ''comedy-drama'' parts which she portrayed in ''Jack O' Hearts'' (1926) and ''A Bowery Cinderella'' (1927).

She researched her own roles like the dance hall girl she played in ''The U.P. Trail'' (1924). Hulette consulted ''Social Life of the Pioneers'' for the [[Fox Film]] production, filmed over a period of two months in [[Nevada]]. The book was published in the 1880s in [[San Francisco, California]]. She discovered that saloons in America's old west provided ''a softening influence, and the nucleus of community consciousness.'' This was due to the young women entertainers found there.

==Late career==

Hulette made her debut in sound films in '' Torch Singer'' (1933). Her final film appearances came in ''Her Resale Value'' (1933) and with uncredited roles in ''The Girl From Missouri'' and ''One Hour Late'', both from 1934.

Gladys Hulette died in [[Montebello, California]] in 1991, aged 95.
