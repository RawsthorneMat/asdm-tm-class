'''Neva Gerber''' (April 3, 1894 &ndash; January 2, 1974) was an American [[silent film]] actress who appeared in 128 films between 1912 and 1930.

==Early life and career==
She was born '''Genevieve Dolores Gerber''' in [[Argenta, Illinois]] to S. Nelson Gerber and Jean Pullman.<ref name="classic"/> Her parents separated when she was young and her mother moved her to [[Los Angeles, California]]. She was raised by nuns from the College of the Immaculate Heart. After the death of her father, Gerber's impoverished mother gave guardianship of her daughter to an attorney.<ref name="lowe">{{cite book|first=Denise|last=Lowe|year=2004|title=An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Women in Early American Films, 1895-1930|publisher=Haworth Press|isbn=0-7890-1843-8|pages=234&ndash;236}}</ref>

After her graduation from high school, Gerber became an actress and appeared in several one-reelers. Beginning in 1917, she starred in multiple [[serial film]]s, and she is considered one of the top ten "serial queens" of the [[silent film]] period. She teamed with director and actor [[Ben F. Wilson]] in many of these productions,<ref>{{cite book|author=Strickland, A.W.; Ackerman, Forrest J.|title=A reference guide to American science fiction films|publisher=T.I.S. Publications Division|year=1981|isbn=0-89917-268-7|page=188}}</ref> and starred in the first crude sound era serial, ''[[The Voice from the Sky]]'', also directed by Wilson. However, her career stalled in 1930 after Wilson died from heart disease. Gerber retired from acting shortly thereafter.<ref name="classic">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicimages.com/past_issues/view/?x=/1999/february99/gerber.html|title=Whatever Became of Neva Gerber ?|last=Doyle|first=Billy|date=February 1999|publisher=classicimages.com|accessdate=February 17, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090429221625/http://www.classicimages.com/past_issues/view/?x=/1999/february99/gerber.html|archivedate=April 29, 2009}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Gerber's first marriage was to actor Arthur Nelson Millett on July 22, 1913. They separated the following year. In 1915, she became engaged to director [[William Desmond Taylor]]. The two never married because Gerber was still married to Millett (their divorce became final in 1920). Taylor was murdered in February 1922. In 1923, Gerber married contractor Edward Dana Nolan. They later divorced and two more times. She remained married to her fourth husband, contractor William Munchoff, until his death in 1960.<ref name="classic" />

==Death==
On January 2, 1974, Gerber died of a [[cerebral thrombosis]] in [[Palm Springs, California]]. She was buried in a [[pauper's grave]] in [[Desert Memorial Park]] in [[Cathedral City, California]].<ref name="classic" />
