'''Volker Schlöndorff''' (born 31 March 1939) is a [[Berlin]]-based [[Germany|German]] filmmaker who has worked in Germany, France and the United States. He was a prominent member of the [[New German Cinema]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which also included [[Werner Herzog]], [[Wim Wenders]] and [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]].

He won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] as well as the [[Palme d'or]] at the [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'' (1979), the film version of the novel by [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Günter Grass]].<ref>[http://www.egs.edu/faculty/volker-schloendorff/biography/ Volker Schlöndorff] at [[European Graduate School]]. Biography and bibliography. (Retrieved May 14, 2010)</ref>

==Early life==
Volker Schlöndorff was born in [[Wiesbaden]], [[Germany]] to the physician Dr. Georg Schlöndorff. In 1956 his family moved to [[Paris]], where Schlöndorff won awards at school for his work in philosophy. He graduated in political science at the [[Sorbonne]], while at the same time studying film at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Cinematographiques, where he met [[Louis Malle]]. Malle gave him his first job as his assistant director on ''[[Zazie in the Metro (film)|Zazie in the Metro]]'', which continued with the films ''[[A Very Private Affair]]'', ''[[The Fire Within]]'' and ''[[Viva Maria!]]''. Schlöndorff also worked as assistant director on [[Alain Resnais]]'s ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]'' and [[Jean-Pierre Melville]]'s ''[[Léon Morin, Priest]]''. During this time he also made his first short film, ''[[Wen kummert's|Who Cares?]]'' about French people living in [[Frankfurt]] in 1960. In 1963 he collaborated with filmmaker [[Jean-Daniel Pollet]] on the 40 minute documentary ''[[Méditerranée (1963 film)|Méditerranée]]''. The film has been highly regarded since its initial release, gaining praise from [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and consistently appearing in the popular book ''[[1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die]]''.

==Early film career==
Schlöndorff returned to Germany to make his feature film debut ''[[Der junge Törless|Young Törless]]''. Produced by Louis Malle and based on the famous novel ''[[The Confusions of Young Törless]]'' by [[Robert Musil]], the film debuted at the [[1966 Cannes Film Festival]]. Taking place at a semi-military Austrian boarding school, Törless witnesses the bullying of a fellow student but does nothing to prevent it despite his superior and mature intellect. He gradually begins to accept his personal responsibility for the abuse by doing nothing to stop it and runs away from the school. The comparison to pre-war Germany were obvious and the film was highly praised upon release, winning the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI Prize]] at Cannes.<ref name="Wakeman">Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1988. 983-987.</ref>

The [[New German Cinema]] movement unofficially began in 1962 with the [[Oberhausen Manifesto]], calling new young German filmmakers to revitalize filmmaking in Germany, much like the [[French New Wave]] and [[British New Wave]] of the previous few years. Although not among the initial group of filmmakers involved, Schlöndorff was quick to align himself with the group and ''[[Der junge Törless|Young Törless]]'' is considered one of the most important films of the [[New German Cinema]].

Schlöndorff's next film was ''[[A Degree of Murder]]'', a counter-culture saturated film with a musical score by [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Brian Jones]]. The film stars Jones' then girlfriend (and later [[Keith Richards]] wife) [[Anita Pallenberg]] as a young waitress who accidentally kills her boyfriend and hides the body with the help of two male friends. The film was very popular upon release amongst "swinging sixties" youths.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

He then made another film that spoke to the counter culture generation, ''[[Michael Kohlhaas - Der Rebell]]''. Set in medieval Germany, Michael Kohlhaas is a horse trader who has been cheated by a local nobleman and nearly starts a revolution to get revenge. The film starred [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]], [[Anna Karina]] and [[Anita Pallenberg]] and was made in both German and English versions.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

Schlöndorff then adapted [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s first play [[Baal (1970 TV Movie)|Baal]] for television and cast an actor named [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] in the lead role, along with [[Margarethe von Trotta]], whom Schlöndorff would marry the following year. Schlöndorff adapted the story of a self-destructive poet to modern day Munich and the film was shown on German TV in 1970. He then made another TV movie ''{{ill|de|Der plötzliche Reichtum der armen Leute von Kombach|Der plötzliche Reichtum der armen Leute von Kombach|The Sudden Wealth of the Poor People of Kombach}}'', again starring Fassbinder. The film depicts 7 peasants in 19th Century Germany who rob the local tax collection cart but are so conditioned by their poverty that they cannot handle their newfound wealth.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

''{{ill|de|Die Moral der Ruth Halbfass|Die Moral der Ruth Halbfass|The Morals of Ruth Halbfass}}'' examined a group of people who have lost their sense of morals and co-starred von Trotta. Von Trotta would both star in and co-write Schlöndorff's next film, ''[[A Free Woman]]''. The film took a feminist look at the condition of modern women in Munich. von Trotta portrays Elizabeth Junker, a recently divorced woman who must struggle to live her life independently as her husband has everything come easily to him, including the villa and son that they had shared together as a married couple. The film is loosely based on von Trotta's experiences with her divorce from her first husband.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

Schlöndorff then completed the TV movie ''[[Übernachtung in Tirol]]'' in 1974, an adaptation of the [[Henry James]] short story ''Les raisons de Georgina'' for German TV and directed his first opera in Frankfurt, a production of [[Leoš Janáček]]'s ''[[Káťa Kabanová]]'' in 1974.

==International success as a filmmaker==
Schlöndorff (and the New German Cinema movement as a whole) had his first financial hit film with ''[[The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum (film)|The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum]]'' in 1975. Based on the [[The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum|novel]] of the same name by [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Prize]] winning German author [[Heinrich Böll]], Schlöndorff both co-wrote and co-directed the film with [[Margarethe von Trotta]] in her directorial debut. The film stars [[Angela Winkler]] as Blum, who after falling in love and spending the night with a young army deserter becomes the victim of a corrupt police investigation and predatory tabloid newspaper, which cast her as both a terrorist and a prostitute. The newspaper is based upon the real right-wing German tabloid ''[[Bild-Zeitung]]'', whose publisher [[Axel Springer]] was the inspiration for the character Werner Tötges.

West Germany was in a political hysteria over the activities of the terrorist group the [[Red Army Faction]], and the police and journalistic activities depicted in both the book and the film accurately portrayed that era as reminiscent of [[McCarthyism]] in 1950s USA, including illegal police raids, phone tapping and tabloid smears. Böll himself was heavily attacked after the books publication, but both the novel and the film were hugely successful in West Germany.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

After directing his second opera ''[[We Come to the River]]'' in 1976, Schlöndorff followed ''The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum'' with the equally political ''[[Coup de Grâce (1976 film)|Coup de Grâce]]'' in 1976. Based on a novel by French author [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], the film stars von Trotta (who again co-wrote the script) as Sophie von Reval, a young left-wing aristocrat who sides with the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] after being rejected by a young German soldier preparing to fight the Red Army in 1919. The film depicts the same time period and subject matter that von Trotta would later revisit in the film ''[[Rosa Luxemburg (film)|Rosa Luxemburg]]''.

A supporting actress in ''[[Coup de Grâce (1976 film)|Coup de Grâce]]'' was Valeska Gert, a former cabaret dancer, circus performer and silent film actress who had worked with [[Greta Garbo]] and [[G. W. Pabst]]. This led to the documentary about her life ''[[Just for Fun, Just for Play]]'' in 1977.

Schlöndorff then contributed to the omnibus film ''[[Germany in Autumn]]'', in which nine German filmmakers (including [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Alexander Kluge]], [[Edgar Reitz]] and author [[Heinrich Böll]]) made short films depicting the hysteria and political chaos in west Germany the [[German Autumn]] of 1977.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

Schlöndorff's next film was the most successful and ambitious of his career, and perhaps the most important film of post-war Germany: ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'', released in 1979. The film was based on the [[The Tin Drum|novel]] by [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Prize]] winning author [[Günter Grass]], who for years had rejected proposed adaptations of his book until giving Schlöndorff his approval (and assistance) to make the film.<ref name="Wakeman"/>

''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'' stars [[David Bennent]] as the protagonist Oscar Matzerath, who, after receiving a tin drum on his third birthday, makes the conscious choice to stop growing and remain a three-year-old for the rest of his life. He hurls himself down a flight of stairs so as to give the adults around him a rational explanation for his handicap, and later discovers that he has the ability to tactically shatter glass with the power of his high-pitch scream, which he evokes whenever anyone attempts to take his tin drum away from him. The film co-stars [[Angela Winkler]] as Oscar's mother and [[Mario Adorf]] and [[Daniel Olbrychski]] as the German and [[Kashubians|Kashubian]] (Pole) who may both be his biological fathers. The film mostly takes place from the end of [[World War I]] to the end of [[World War II]] (when Oscar is 20) in the city of [[Danzig]], [[Poland]]. Danzig is most famous for being the site of the first battle of the war at the polish [[Defense of the Polish Post Office in Danzig|Post Office]], which Oscar takes part in.

The film was widely hailed as a masterpiece<ref name="Wakeman"/> and shared the [[Palme d'or]] at the [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]] with ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', as well as winning the 1979 [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].

In 1980 Schlöndorff collaborated with [[Stefan Aust]], [[Alexander Kluge]] and Alexander von Eschwege on the documentary ''[[The Candidate (1980 film)|The Candidate]]'', a film about the political campaign of arch-conservative [[Franz Josef Strauss]].

Schlöndorff next made ''[[Die Fälschung|The Circle of Deceit]]'' in 1981. Based on the novel by [[Nicolas Born]], the film concerns the politics and moral struggles of war photographers. The film stars [[Bruno Ganz]] and [[Jerzy Skolimowski]] as photojournalists covering the [[Lebanon Civil War]] in Beirut in 1975.

== Hollywood and later career ==
Schlöndorff's first English language film was ''[[Swann in Love (film)|Swann in Love]]'', an adaptation of the first two volumes of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. The film was shot in France and financed by [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]], and stars [[Jeremy Irons]], [[Ornella Muti]], [[Alain Delon]] and [[Fanny Ardant]].

Schlöndorff then went to the United States to make a TV adaptation of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Death of a Salesman (1985 film)|Death of a Salesman]]'', starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Willy Loman]] and [[John Malkovich]] as Biff. Both actors won [[Primetime Emmy Award|Emmy]]'s for their performances and Schlöndorff was nominated for an Emmy for his direction. The film premiered on Television in 1985 and was released theatrically throughout Europe over the following years.

Schlöndorff followed this with another TV Movie in the US, ''[[A Gathering of Old Men (film)|A Gathering of Old Men]]'', based on the [[A Gathering of Old Men|novel of the same name]] by [[Ernest J. Gaines]]. The film stars [[Richard Widmark]], [[Holly Hunter]] and [[Louis Gossett, Jr.|Lou Gossett Jr.]] and concerns [[racism#Racial discrimination|racial discrimination]] in 1970s Louisiana.

Schlöndorff returned to theatrical films with the Hollywood science fiction film ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'' in 1990. The film's story takes place in a dystopia near future where most women are sterile due to pollution. Kate ([[Natasha Richardson]]) is arrested after attempting to flee to Canada and forced to become a "Handmaid". Handmaids are fertile women who are enslaved by the state and put in the households of wealthy men - who have "ceremonial" sex with them in the hope of conceiving a child. She becomes the Handmaid of the Commander ([[Robert Duvall]]), Fred, who is married to Serena Joy ([[Faye Dunaway]]). To save herself from execution, Kate - renamed "Offred," since she now is attached to Fred's household - allows the Commander's driver ([[Aidan Quinn]]) to impregnate her and falls in love with him. The film was in competition at the [[40th Berlin International Film Festival]].

This was quickly followed by ''[[Voyager (film)|Voyager]]'' in 1991. The film stars [[Sam Shepard]] as a man who survives a plane crash, then finds the love of his life ([[Julie Delpy]]) on his next trip and begins to question the rationale of his good luck after having spent most of his life being cruel to others. The film was based on the novel ''[[Homo Faber (film)|Homo Faber]]'' by [[Max Frisch]] and was not a success financially.

In 1992 he directed the concert film ''[[The Michael Nyman Songbook]]'', then made the first of his two documentaries on famous director [[Billy Wilder]], ''[[Billy Wilder, How Did You Do It?]]'', in which he and German critic Hellmut Karasek interviewed Wilder about his career over the course of two weeks in 1988. It was aired on German TV in 1992, and shown on [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] in the USA under the title ''Billy Wilder Speaks'' in 2006. Schlöndorff had been a great admirer of Wilder for many years and sought his advice during the making of ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]''

Appalled at plans of destroying the historic film studios [[Potsdam-Babelsberg|Babelsberg]], Schlöndorff mounted a one-man campaign to save them in the early 1990s.<ref name="articles.latimes.com">Mary Williams Walsh (September 22, 1996), [http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-22/entertainment/ca-46386_1_studio-babelsberg The Savior of Babelsberg (Well, Almost)] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> He served as the chief executive for the [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] studio in Babelsberg between 1992 and 1997.<ref name="articles.latimes.com"/> During that time, he helped [[Jiang Wen]] finish editing his 1994 film ''[[In the Heat of the Sun]]'' at in Germany, with the studio’s full financial support. He also helped to get the film selected for the [[51st Venice International Film Festival]].<ref>Edward Wong (October 16, 2013), [http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/cinema-heavyweights-open-german-film-festival/ Cinema Heavyweights Open German Film Festival] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In 1996 he contributed to the French TV series ''[[Lumière sur un massacre]]'' with the episode "Le parfait soldat".

Schlöndorff returned to Germany in 1996 to make ''[[The Ogre (1996 film)|The Ogre]]'', his most well regarded feature film since ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]''. Based on a novel by [[Michel Tournier]] and starring [[John Malkovich]] as the titular Abel Tiffauges, the film revisited many of the themes and time period of ''The Tin Drum''. Tiffauges is a slow-witted French soldier who has been accused of child molestation. After being captured by the Nazis and put in an internment camp, he is made a servant at an elite German training camp and kidnaps local children, officially as a way to recruit them for the camp, but in his mind to protect them. The film was screened in competition at the [[1996 Venice Film Festival]] and won the UNICEF award. The film was released in Germany in 1996 and gained positive reviews. On the audio commentary for ''The Tin Drum'', Schlöndorff said that he had wanted to film a sequel to ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'', as the film was based only on the first two thirds of the novel. But because actor David Bennent was too old to reprise the role and he did not want to recast Oscar, he considers ''[[The Ogre (1996 film)|The Ogre]]'' to be an unofficial sequel to his masterpiece.

Schlöndorff returned to Hollywood for the [[Neo-noir]] ''[[Palmetto (film)|Palmetto]]'' in 1998. In a classic noir plot, the film stars [[Woody Harrelson]] as a falsely accused journalist who was sent to jail after uncovering corruption in the local government. After getting out of jail and unable to find work, he encounters Rhea Malroux ([[Elisabeth Shue]]), a [[femme fatale]] who propositions him to help her extort money from her millionaire husband. The film was not a financial success and has so far been Schlöndorff's last film in the US.

Schlöndorff returned to Germany to make the 2000 film ''[[The Legend of Rita]]''. Loosely based upon the lives of members of the [[Red Army Faction]] who exiled to East Germany in the 1970s, the film centers around Rita, who most closely resembles real RAF member Inge Viett. Rita abandons the revolution and live in East Germany under protection of the secret service, but much risk discovery and consequences for her past crimes after German unification.

After the documentary ''[[Ein Produzent hat Seele oder er hat keine]]'' and a contribution to the [[anthology film|omnibus film]] ''[[Ten Minutes Older]]'' (both in 2002), Schlöndorff made ''[[The Ninth Day]]'' in 2004. The film is Schlöndorff's third film to center around the [[World War II]] and is based on the diary of [[Father Jean Bernard]]. [[Ulrich Matthes]] plays Father Henri Kremer, a Catholic Priest who is interned at [[Dachau concentration camp]] during the second World War. He is inexplicably released for 9 days and sent to Luxembourg. There he meets a young SS Soldier who informs him that his mission there is to convince the local bishop to cooperate with the Nazi Party, in which case he will not be sent back to Dachau. He is thus faced with the moral dilemma of betraying his faith or returning to the concentration camp.

Schlöndorff then completed the TV Movie ''[[Enigma - Eine uneingestandene Liebe]]'' in 2005. In 2006 he returned to the city of Danzig to film ''[[Strike (2006 film)|Strike]]'', a docudrama about labor strikes at the [[Gdańsk Shipyard]] during the [[Polish 1970 protests]], and itself is a history of the [[Solidarity Movement]] in Poland leading up to the Fall of Communism.

Schlöndorff's ''[[Ulzhan]]'' (2007) stars [[Philippe Torreton]] as a treasure hunter on his way home who has lost his soul and Ayanat Ksenbai as Ulzhan, the woman who falls in love with him. [[David Bennent]] also co-starred. In the summer of 2012, he worked with Andrew Turner, who had formerly been a runway model for the late [[Alexander McQueen]]. Schlöndorffs [[World War II]]-era film ''Diplomacy'', dedicated to his friend [[Richard C. Holbrooke]] debuted at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]]. Set in 1944, it explores how the Swedish consul general in Paris, [[Raoul Nordling]], helped persuade the Nazi military governor of Paris, [[Dietrich von Choltitz]], not to obey Hitler’s orders to destroy the historic city should it fall into enemy hands.<ref>Rachel Donadio (February 9, 2014), [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/movies/europes-painful-past-colors-a-film-festival.html Europe’s Painful Past Colors a Film Festival] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

==Personal life==
Schlöndorff was married to fellow film director [[Margarethe von Trotta]] from 1971 to 1991 and helped raise her son from her first marriage. He is currently married to Angelika Schlöndorff, and the couple has one daughter.<ref>Peter Craven and Volker Schlöndorff.

He formed a production company that produced both his and von Trotta's films, Bioskop.

In 1991, he was the Head of the Jury at the [[41st Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale 1991">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1991/04_jury_1991/04_Jury_1991.html |title=Berlinale: 1991 Juries |accessdate=2011-03-21 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>
