'''Woodrow Wilson Woolwine "Woody" Strode''' (July 25, 1914 – December 31, 1994) was a [[decathlon|decathlete]] and [[American football|football]] star who went on to become a popular and pioneering [[African-American]] film actor.  He was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' in 1960. He served in the United States Army during World War II.

==Early life and athletic career==
Strode was born in [[Los Angeles, California]]. He attended Thomas Jefferson High School in South East Los Angeles and college at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], where he was a member of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity. His world-class decathlon capabilities were spearheaded by a {{convert|50|ft|m|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} plus [[shot put]] (when the world record was {{convert|57|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}) and a {{height|ft=6|in=4}} high jump (the world record at time was {{height|ft=6|in=10}}). Strode posed for a nude portrait, part of [[Hubert Stowitts]]'s acclaimed exhibition of athletic portraits shown at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin Olympics]] (although the inclusion of black and Jewish athletes caused the [[Nazi]]s to close the exhibit).<ref>Stowitts, Hubert Julian. American champions; fifty portraits of American athletes by Stowitts, Tiergartenstrasse 21a, Berlin, 9.–15. September 1936, unter dem Protektorat des Amerikanischen Botschafters und Mitwirkung der Vereinigung Carl Schurz, anlässlich der XI. Olympiade, special sport exhibition. Stowitts, 1936</ref>

Strode, [[Kenny Washington (American football)|Kenny Washington]] and [[Jackie Robinson]] starred on the 1939 [[UCLA Bruins football]] team, in which they made up three of the four backfield players.<ref>B.J. VIOLETT – [http://www.today.ucla.edu/1997/970425TeammatesRecall.html TEAMMATES RECALL JACKIE ROBINSON’S LEGACY]. UCLA Today magazine, 1997</ref> Along with [[Ray Bartlett]], there were four African-Americans playing for the Bruins, when only a few dozen at all played on other college football teams.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-9389095 "Kenny Washington]" ''Encyclopædia Britannica''</ref> They played eventual conference and national champion [[USC Trojans football team|Southern Cal]] to a 0–0 tie with the [[1940 Rose Bowl]] on the line. It was the first [[UCLA–USC rivalry]] football game with national implications.

When World War II broke out, Strode was playing for the Hollywood Bears Football team but soon joined the Air Force and spent the war unloading bombs in Guam and the Marianas, as well as playing on the Army football team at March Field in Riverside, California. After the war, he worked at serving subpoenas and escorting prisoners for the LA County District Attorney's Office before being signed, briefly, to the Los Angeles Rams along with Kenny Washington. They were the first African-American players to play in the NFL for many years. When out on the road with the team, Strode had his first experience with racism, something he wasn't aware of growing up in Los Angeles. "We were unconscious of color. We used to sit in the best seats at the Cocoanut Grove listening to Donald Novis sing. If someone said, "there's a Negro over there,' I was just as apt as anyone to turn around and say 'Where?' I had a black principal in my grammar school when I was a kid. On the Pacific Coast there wasn't anything we couldn't do. As we got out of the L.A. area we found these racial tensions. Hell, we thought we were white." 

Strode and fellow UCLA alumnus [[Kenny Washington (American football)|Kenny Washington]] were two of the first African-Americans to play in major college programs and later the modern [[National Football League]], playing for the [[Los Angeles Rams]] in 1946.  No black men had played in the NFL from 1933 to 1946.<ref>NFL 2001 Record and Fact Book, Workman Publishing Co, New York,NY, ISBN 0-7611-2480-2, p. 280</ref> UCLA teammate Jackie Robinson would go on to break the color barrier in [[Major League baseball]] (in fact, all three had played in the semi-professional [[Pacific Coast Professional Football League]] earlier in the decade). He played for two seasons with the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Western Interprovincial Football Union]] in Canada, where he was a member of Calgary's 1948 [[Grey Cup]] Championship team<ref>{{cite news |last=Busby |first=Ian |title=Lougheed among long list of CFLers who found fame later |work=Calgary Sun |date=2012-09-19 |page=S4}}</ref>  before retiring due to injury in 1949.

==Professional wrestling career==
In 1941, Strode had dabbled for several months in [[professional wrestling]].<ref>Woody Strode, ''Goal Dust'', Madison Books, 1990, ISBN 0-8191-7680-X, p. 121</ref>  Following the end of his football career in 1949, he returned to wrestling part-time between acting jobs until 1962, wrestling the likes of [[Gorgeous George]].<ref>Woody Strode, ''Goal Dust'', Madison Books, 1990, ISBN 0-8191-7680-X, pp. 171–79</ref>

In 1952, Strode wrestled almost every week from August 12, 1952 to December 10, 1952 in different cities in California. He was billed as the Pacific Coast Heavyweight Wrestling Champion and the Pacific Coast Negro Heavyweight Wrestling Champion in 1962.<ref name="Ring196205">''[[Ring Magazine]],'' May 1962, page 38</ref> He later [[tag team|teamed up]] with both [[Bobo Brazil]] and [[Bearcat Wright]].

==Acting career==
As an actor, the 6&nbsp;ft 4 in (1.93 m) Strode was noted for film roles that contrasted with the stereotypes of the time. He is probably best remembered for his brief Golden Globe-nominated role in ''[[Spartacus (1960 film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) as the Ethiopian [[gladiator]] Draba, in which he fights [[Kirk Douglas]] to the death.

Strode made his first credited appearance in 1941 in ''[[Sundown (1941 film)|Sundown]]'', but became more active in the 1950s, eventually in roles of increasing depth. He played an African warrior in ''The Lion Hunters'' in [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram]]'s ''Bomba the Jungle Boy'' series in 1951. Also, he appeared in several episodes of the 1952–1954 television series "Ramar of the Jungle", where he portrayed an African warrior. He played dual roles (billed as "Woodrow Strode") in ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956) as an [[Ethiopia]]n king as well as a slave, and in 1959 portrayed the cowardly Private Franklin in ''[[Pork Chop Hill]]''. He appeared once on [[Johnny Weismuller]]'s 1955–1956 [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[Jungle Jim (TV series)|Jungle Jim]]''.

He became a close friend of director [[John Ford]], who gave him the title role in ''[[Sergeant Rutledge]]'' (1960) as a member of the Ninth Cavalry falsely accused of rape and murder; he appeared in smaller roles in Ford's later films ''[[Two Rode Together]]'' (1961), ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962) and ''[[Seven Women]]'' (1966). Strode was very close to the director.  During Ford's declining years, Strode once spent four months sleeping on the director's floor as his caretaker, and he was later present at Ford's death.<ref>Woody Strode, ''Goal Dust'', Madison Books, 1990, ISBN 0-8191-7680-X, pp. 215–18, 249</ref>

Strode played memorable villains opposite three screen [[Tarzan]]s. In 1958, he appeared as Ramo opposite [[Gordon Scott]] in ''[[Tarzan's Fight for Life]]''.  In 1963, he was cast opposite [[Jock Mahoney]]'s Tarzan as both the dying leader of an unnamed Asian country and that leader's unsavory brother, Khan, in ''[[Tarzan's Three Challenges]]''. In the late 1960s, he appeared in several episodes of the [[Ron Ely]] ''[[Tarzan (NBC series)|Tarzan]]'' television series. Strode played the part of Binnaburra in "Incident of the Boomerang" on ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' in 1961.

Strode's other television work included a role as the Grand Mogul in the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episodes "Marsha, Queen of Diamonds" and "Marsha's Scheme of Diamonds," appearing also in the third season of the ''[[Daniel Boone (TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' television series as the slave/wrestler Goliath in the episode of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daniel Boone TV show|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0554274/|publisher=IMDB}}</ref>

Strode played a heroic sailor on a sinking ship in the 1960 film ''[[The Last Voyage]]''.  In 1966, he landed a major starring role as a soldier of fortune and expert archer in ''[[The Professionals (1966 film)|The Professionals]]'', a major box-office success that established him as a recognizable star.  Another notable part was as a gunslinger in the opening sequence of [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968); after this, he appeared in several other [[spaghetti Western]]s of lesser quality.  His starring role as a thinly-disguised [[Patrice Lumumba]] in ''Seduto alla sua destra'' (released in the U.S. as '' [[Black Jesus (film)|Black Jesus]]'') garnered Strode a great deal of press at the time, but the film is largely forgotten now.

He remained a visible [[character actor]] throughout the 1970s and 1980s in such films as ''[[Scream (1981 film)|Scream]]'' (1981), and has become widely regarded (along with [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Brock Peters]]) as one of the most important black film actors of his time. His last film was ''[[The Quick and the Dead (1995 film)|The Quick and the Dead]]'' (1995), which starred [[Gene Hackman]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Russell Crowe]]. The closing credits dedicate the film to Strode.

==Personal life==
Strode was the son of a [[Creek people|Creek]]-[[Blackfoot]]-[[Black people|black]] father and a [[Black people|black]]-[[Cherokee]] mother.<ref>Woody Strode, ''Goal Dust'', Madison Books, 1990, ISBN 0-8191-7680-X, pp. 1–3)</ref> His first wife was Princess Luukialuana Kalaeloa (a.k.a. Luana Strode), a distant relative of [[Liliuokalani]], the last queen of [[Hawaii]]. With her he had a son, Kalai, in 1946. They were married until her death in 1980.<ref>Woody Strode, ''Goal Dust'', Madison Books, 1990, ISBN 0-8191-7680-X, p. 78</ref> In 1982, he wed Tina Tompson, and they remained married until his death. Strode was a dedicated martial artist under the direction of Frank Landers in the art of [[SeishinDo Kenpo]].<ref>Fighting Stars Magazine – July 1978</ref><ref>http://www.seishindokenpo.com/ska/index.php/Seishindo_Kenpo</ref>

==Death==
Strode died of [[lung cancer]] on December 31, 1994, in [[Glendora, California]], aged 80.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/04/obituaries/woody-strode-80-character-actor.html Woody Strode, 80, Character Actor]</ref> He is buried at [[Riverside National Cemetery]] in [[Riverside, California]].
