==Career==

===Television performances===
[[File:Robert Culp Trackdown 1957.JPG|left|thumb|125px|''[[Trackdown (TV series)|Trackdown]]'']]
Culp first came to national attention very early in his career as the star of the 1957&ndash;1959 [[Western (genre)|Western]] television series ''[[Trackdown (TV series)|Trackdown]]'', in which he played Ranger Hoby Gilman, based in the fictional town of Porter, Texas, of which he is also the [[sheriff]].<ref name="LA Times Obit"/> ''Trackdown'' is a spin-off of ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre]]'', which also aired on [[CBS]]. Culp's character was introduced in an episode titled "Badge of Honor". Culp later appeared in two other episodes of ''Zane Grey Theater'' — "Morning Incident" and "Calico Bait" (both 1960) playing different roles. ''Trackdown'' then had a CBS spin-off of its own: ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', with [[Steve McQueen]] as [[bounty hunter]] Josh Randall.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 103-106</ref>

After ''Trackdown'' ended in 1959 following two seasons on the air, Culp continued to work in television, including a guest-starring role as Stewart Douglas in the 1960 episode "So Dim the Light" of CBS's [[anthology series]], ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]''. In the summer of 1960, he guest starred on [[David McLean (actor)|David McLean]]'s [[NBC]] western series, ''[[Tate (TV series)|Tate]]''. He also played Clay Horne in the series finale, "Cave-In", of the CBS western ''[[Johnny Ringo (TV series)|Johnny Ringo]]'', starring [[Don Durant]]. In 1961, Culp played the part of Craig Kern, a morphine addicted soldier, in the episode "Incident on Top of the World" in the CBS series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''. About this time, Culp was cast on the NBC anthology series, ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'' and in the NBC [[American Civil War|Civil War]] drama, ''[[The Americans (1961 TV series)|The Americans]]''.

Culp was cast as Captain Shark in a first season episode of NBC's ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' (1964). Among his more memorable performances were in three episodes of the science-fiction anthology series on ABC ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' (1963–1965), including the classic "[[Demon with a Glass Hand]]", written by [[Harlan Ellison]]. In the 1961 season, he guest starred on the [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]'s [[western (genre)|western]] ''[[Bonanza]]'' In the 1961–1962 season, he guest starred on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[crime drama]] ''[[Target: The Corruptors!]].'' In the 1962–1963 season, he guest starred in NBC's modern Western series ''[[Empire (1962 TV series)|Empire]]'' starring [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]]. In 1965, he was cast as Frank Melo in "The Tender Twigs" of [[James Franciscus]]'s NBC education drama series, ''[[Mr. Novak]]'', guest starring along with the Crawford brothers, [[Johnny Crawford|Johnny]] and [[Robert L. Crawford, Jr.|Robert]].

Culp then played [[espionage|secret agent]] Kelly Robinson, who operated [[undercover]] as a touring [[tennis]] professional, for three years on the hit NBC series ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' (1965–1968), with co-star [[Bill Cosby]]. Culp wrote the scripts for seven episodes, one of which he also directed. One episode earned him an Emmy nomination for writing. For all three years of the series he was also nominated for an acting Emmy (Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Series category), but lost each time to Cosby.

[[File:Robert Culp Kamala Devi I Spy 1966.JPG|thumb|180px|Culp with [[Kamala Devi (actress)|Kamala Devi]] in ''I Spy'', 1966.]]
In 1968, Culp also made an uncredited cameo appearance as an inebriated Turkish waiter on ''[[Get Smart]]'', the spy-spoof comedy series, in an ''I Spy'' parody episode titled "Die Spy". In this, secret agent Maxwell Smart played by [[Don Adams]] in effect assumes Culp's Kelly Robinson character as he pretends to be an international table-tennis champion. The episode faithfully recreates the ''I Spy'' theme music, montage graphics, and back-and-forth banter between Robinson and Scott—with actor/comedian Stu Gilliam imitating Cosby.

In 1971, Culp, [[Peter Falk]], [[Robert Wagner]], and [[Darren McGavin]] each stepped in to take turns with [[Anthony Franciosa]]'s rotation of NBC's series ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'' after Franciosa was fired, alternating a lead role of the lavish 90-minute show about the magazine business with [[Gene Barry]] and [[Robert Stack]].

Culp is also remembered as the special guest murderer in three separate ''[[Columbo]]'' episodes (in 1971, 1972, and 1973) and also appeared in a 1990 episode, then as the father of one of two young murderers. See [[List of Columbo episodes#Repeat offenders|Columbo's Repeat Offenders]].

In 1973, Culp almost took the male lead in the sci-fi television series ''[[Space: 1999]]''. During negotiations with creator and executive producer [[Gerry Anderson]], Culp expressed himself to be not only an asset as an actor, but also as a director and producer for the proposed series. The part instead went to [[Martin Landau]].<ref>''Starburst'' issue 8 (April 1979)</ref>

Culp co-starred in ''[[The Greatest American Hero]]'' as tough veteran [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent Bill Maxwell, who teams up with a high school teacher who receives superpowers from extraterrestrials.  Culp wrote and directed the second season finale episode "Lilacs, Mr. Maxwell", with free rein to do the episode as he saw fit.  The show lasted three years from 1981 to 1983.<ref name="LA Times Obit"/> He reprised the role in a voice-over on the stop-motion sketch comedy ''[[Robot Chicken]]''.

In 1987, he reunited with Bill Cosby on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', playing Dr. Cliff Huxtable's old friend Scott Kelly. The name was a combination of their ''I Spy'' characters' names.

When contract negotiations with [[Larry Hagman]] over his character, J.R. Ewing, on the soap opera ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' faltered, it was rumored that Culp was ready to step into the role. However, this turned out to be untrue. Culp said in interviews that he was never contacted by anyone from ''Dallas'' about the part. He was working on ''The Greatest American Hero'' at the time and stated that he would not have left his role as Maxwell even if it had been offered.

Culp also had a recurring role on ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'' as Warren Whelan, the father of [[Debra Barone]] and father-in-law of [[Ray Barone]]. He appeared on episodes of other television programs including a 1961 season three episode of ''[[Bonanza]]'' titled "Broken Ballad", as well as ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[The Nanny]]'', ''[[The Girls Next Door]]'' and ''[[Wings (1990 TV series)|Wings]]''. He was the voice of the character Halcyon Renard in the Disney adventure cartoon ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''.

In ''I Spy Returns'' (1994), a nostalgic television movie, Culp and Cosby reprised their roles as Robinson and Scott for the first time since 1968.  Culp and Cosby reunited one last time on the television show ''Cosby'' in an episode entitled "My Spy" (1999), in which Cosby's character, Hilton Lucas, dreams he is Alexander Scott on a mission with Kelly Robinson. Robert Culp also appeared on ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' as Lyle Pike on the episode "Trust No One" (February 18, 1995).

===Film performances===
Culp worked as an actor in many theatrical films, beginning with three in 1963: As naval officer John F. Kennedy's good friend Ensign George Ross in ''[[PT 109 (film)|PT 109]]'', as legendary [[gunslinger]] [[Wild Bill Hickok]] in ''The Raiders'' and as the debonair fiance of [[Jane Fonda]] in the romantic comedy ''[[Sunday in New York]]''.

He went on to star in the provocative ''[[Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice]]'' in 1969, probably the height of his movie career. Another memorable role came as another gunslinger, Thomas Luther Price, in ''[[Hannie Caulder]]'' (1971) opposite [[Raquel Welch]]. A year later, ''[[Hickey & Boggs]]'' reunited him with Cosby for the first time since ''I Spy''. Culp also directed this feature film, in which he and Cosby portray over-the-hill private eyes. In 1986, he had a primary role as General Woods in the comedy ''Combat Academy''.

Culp played the [[U.S. President]] in Alan J. Pakula's 1993 murder mystery ''[[The Pelican Brief (film)|The Pelican Brief]]'' starring [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Julia Roberts]].

===Other appearances===
Culp lent his voice to the digital character [[Doctor Breen]], the prime [[antagonist]] in the 2004 [[Video game|computer game]] ''[[Half-Life 2]]''. This was not his first video game role, however: he also appeared in the 1993 game ''[[Voyeur (video game)|Voyeur]]''.

The video clip of "[[Guilty Conscience (song)|Guilty Conscience]]" features Culp as an erudite and detached narrator describing the scenes where [[Eminem]] and [[Dr. Dre]] rap lyrics against each other. He only appears in the music video. In the album version, the narrator is [[Mark Avery]].

On November 9, 2007, on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', host [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] interviewed Culp about the actor's career and awarded Culp with the distinction "TV Icon of the Week".

Culp played "Simon," Blanche's beau, in the episode "Like the Beep Beep Beep of My Tom Tom" when Blanche needs a pacemaker on ''[[The Golden Girls]]''.

==Personal life==
Culp married five times and fathered three sons - Joshua (1958), Jason (1961), and [[Joseph Culp|Joseph]] (1963) - and two daughters - Rachel (1964) and Samantha (1982).<ref name="NY Times Obit" /> From 1967 to 1970, he was married to [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] ([[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Vietnamese-French]]) actress [[France Nguyen]] (known as [[France Nuyen]]), whom he had met when she guest-starred on ''I Spy''. She appeared in four episodes, two of them written by Culp himself.

Culp wrote scripts for a total of seven ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'' episodes, one of which he also directed.{{which|date=June 2014}} He would later write and direct two episodes of ''[[The Greatest American Hero]]''.{{which|date=June 2014}} He also wrote scripts for other television series, including ''[[Trackdown (TV series)|Trackdown]]'', a two-part episode from ''[[The Rifleman]]'', and ''[[Cain's Hundred]]''.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0191685/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1</ref>

He was a friend of [[Hugh Hefner]], with whom he often played poker and frequently visited at the [[Playboy Mansion]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Death==
Culp took frequent walks in the Runyon Canyon, a park close to his apartment in the [[Hollywood Hills]] of Los Angeles. On the morning of March 24, 2010, he left the apartment to go for a walk. Later, a jogger found him lying unconscious on the sidewalk (foot path) close to the lower entrance of the canyon. [[Police officer]]s and paramedics were summoned quickly, but they were unable to revive him. Culp was taken to [[Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center]], but all efforts at resuscitation were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at about 11:00 a.m. He was 79 years old. Although the first reports from the police suggested that Culp died from striking his head on the ground when he fell, it was later found that he had collapsed and died of a [[heart attack]]. Culp's only injury from his fall was a minor cut on his head.

On April 10, 2010, a memorial service for Culp was held at the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles, with his family, friends, and some of his fans attending. At the time of his death, Culp had just completed the filming of a supporting role in the motion picture, ''The Assignment''. Culp was also working on several screenplays at the time of his death. One of these screenplays, an adaptation of the story of ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'', had already been accepted for filming, and it was scheduled for the start of production in [[Hong Kong]] later in 2012, with Culp being the [[film director]].  ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'' had been Culp's favorite [[comic strip]] as a boy, and it was his longtime wish to make a film based on it.<ref name="NY Times Obit" /><ref name="LA Times Obit" /><ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/24/AR2010032403038.html| title = Robert Culp dead; actor conveyed charm and wit on TV's 'I Spy'| author = T.

Culp's remains were buried in the Sunset View Cemetery in [[El Cerrito, California]], located not far from his hometown of Oakland.
