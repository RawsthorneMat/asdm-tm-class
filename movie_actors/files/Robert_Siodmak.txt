'''Robert Siodmak''' (8 August 1900 &ndash; 10 March 1973) was a German-born American [[film director]]. He is best remembered as a [[Thriller film|thriller]] specialist<ref name="mov">{{cite journal | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Wettbewerb/In Competition | journal = [[Moving Pictures (magazine)|Moving Pictures]], Berlinale Extra | volume = | issue = | pages = p.84–85 | publisher = | location = Berlin | date = 11–22 February 1998 | url = | format = | issn = | accessdate = }}</ref>  and for the series of Hollywood [[film noir|films noirs]] he made in the 1940s.

==Early life==
Siodmak was born in [[Dresden]], [[German Empire|Germany]], the son of Rosa Philippine (née Blum) and Ignatz Siodmak.<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=20YcAQAAIAAJ&q=philippine+Siodmak+leipzig&dq=philippine+Siodmak+leipzig&hl=en]</ref> His parents were both from Jewish families in [[Leipzig]] (the myth of his American birth in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] was necessary for him to obtain a visa in [[Paris]]). He worked as a stage director and a banker before becoming editor and scenarist for [[Curtis Bernhardt]] in 1925. At twenty-six he was hired by his cousin, producer [[Seymour Nebenzal]], to assemble original silent movies from stock footage of old films. Siodmak worked at this for two years before he persuaded Nebenzal to finance his first feature, the silent chef d'oeuvre, ''[[People on Sunday]] (Menschen am Sonntag)'' (1929). The script was written by his younger brother [[Curt Siodmak]], later the screenwriter of ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941).

With the rise of [[Nazism]] he left Germany for Paris and then [[Hollywood]]. Siodmak arrived in Hollywood in 1939, where he made 23 movies, many of them widely popular thrillers and crime melodramas, which critics today regard as classics of film noir.

==Hollywood career==
Beginning in 1941, he first turned out several B-films and programmers for various studios before he gained a seven-year contract with [[Universal Studios]] in 1943. As house director, his services were often used to salvage troublesome productions at the studio. On Mark Hellinger's production ''Swell Guy'' (1946), for instance, Siodmak was brought in to replace [[Frank Tuttle]] only six days after completing work on ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]''.

At Universal, Siodmak made yet another B-film, ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' (1943), the third in a trilogy of Dracula movies (based on his brother [[Curt Siodmak|Curt]]'s original story). His second feature, and first A-film, was the [[Maria Montez]]-[[Jon Hall (actor)|Jon Hall]] vehicle, ''[[Cobra Woman]]'' (1944), made in garish [[Technicolor]].

His first all-out noir was ''[[Phantom Lady (film)|Phantom Lady]]'' (1944), for staff producer [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], Universal's first female executive and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s former secretary and script assistant. Following the critical success of ''Phantom Lady'', Siodmak directed ''[[Christmas Holiday]]'' (1944) with [[Deanna Durbin]]. For the first time in Hollywood, his work attained the stylistic and thematic characteristics that are evident in his later noirs. His black-and-white stylisations and urban backdrop together with his light-and-shadow designs formed the basic structure of classic noir films. ''Christmas Holiday'' was Deanna Durbin's most successful feature, and she considered it her only good film. During Siodmak's tenure, Universal made the most of the noir style, but the capstone was ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' in 1946. A critical and financial success, it earned Siodmak his only Oscar nomination for direction in Hollywood (his German production ''[[The Devil Strikes at Night]] (Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam)'' would be nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1956).<ref name="Oscars1958">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/30th-winners.html |title=The 30th Academy Awards (1958) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=25 October 2011|work=oscars.org}}</ref> Robert Siodmak was considered an actor's director, discovering [[Burt Lancaster]] and skillfully directing actresses such as [[Ava Gardner]], [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Dorothy McGuire]], [[Yvonne de Carlo]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and [[Ella Raines]].<ref name=mov/>

==Return to Europe==
Before leaving Hollywood for Europe in 1952, following the problematic production ''The Crimson Pirate'' for Warner Bros., his third and last film with [[Burt Lancaster]], Siodmak had directed some of the era's best films noirs (twelve in all), more than any other director who worked in that genre. However, his identification with film noir, generally unpopular with American audiences, may have been more of a curse than a blessing.

He often expressed his desire to make pictures "of a different type and background" than the ones he had been making for ten years. Nevertheless, he ended his Universal contract with one last noir, the disappointing ''Deported'' (1951) which he filmed partly abroad (Siodmak was among the first refugee directors to return to Europe after making American films).

Those "different types" of films he had made - ''The Great Sinner'' (1949) for [[MGM]], ''Time Out of Mind'' (1947) for Universal (which Siodmak also produced), ''The Whistle at Eaton Falls'' (1951) for [[Columbia Pictures]] - all proved ill-suited to his noir sensibilities (although ''The Crimson Pirate'', despite the difficult production, was a surprising and pleasing departure).

The five months he collaborated with [[Budd Schulberg]] on a screenplay tentatively titled ''A Stone in the River Hudson'', an early version of ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' was also a major disappointment for Siodmak. In 1954 he sued producer [[Sam Spiegel]] for copyright infringement. Siodmak was awarded $100,000, but no screen credit. His contribution to the original screenplay has never been acknowledged.

After returning to the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], he made ''[[Die Ratten|The Rats]] (Die Ratten)'' which went on to win the [[Golden Bear|Golden Berlin Bear]] at the [[5th Berlin International Film Festival|1955 Berlin Film Festival]],<ref name="Berlinale 1955">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1955/03_preistr_ger_1955/03_Preistraeger_1955.html |title=5th Berlin International Film Festival: Prize Winners |accessdate=24 December 2009 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> and ''[[The Devil Strikes at Night]] (Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam,'' 1957) which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] and is based on the true story of [[Bruno Lüdke]].<ref name=mov/><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050746/ imdb]</ref>

==Later career==
His return to Hollywood film-making in 1967 to make the wide-screen western ''[[Custer of the West]]'' was another disappointment. Siodmak fared better in Europe, especially with the British film ''The Rough and the Smooth'' (1959), another noir, but much meaner and gloomier than anything he had made in America.

He ended his career with a six-hour, two-part toga and chariot epic, ''[[Kampf um Rom]]'' (1968), a more campy work (perhaps intentionally) than ''Cobra Woman'' had been. There was a brief and profitable foray into television in Great Britain with the series ''O.S.S.'' (1957–58). Siodmak was last seen publicly in an interview for Swiss television at his home in [[Ascona]] in 1971. He died alone in 1973 in [[Locarno]], seven weeks after his wife's death.

The [[British Film Institute]] will be running a restrospective of his career in April and May 2015.<ref>https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=robertsiodmak</ref>
