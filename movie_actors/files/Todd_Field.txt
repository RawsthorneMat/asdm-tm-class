As a child in Portland, Field was a batboy for the [[Portland Mavericks]], a single A independent minor league baseball club owned by Hollywood actor [[Bing Russell]].  [[Kurt Russell]], Bing's son and later an acclaimed Hollywood actor in his own right, also played for the Portland Mavericks during this time.<ref>{{cite web |title="The Battered Bastards of Baseball" impresses Sundance|url=http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/01/27/the-battered-bastards-of-baseball-impresses-sundance/|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}</ref> Field and Maverick Pitching Coach Rob Nelson created the first batch of [[Big League Chew]]  in the Field family kitchen. In 1980 Nelson and former [[New York Yankees]] all-star [[Jim Bouton]] sold the idea to the [[Wrigley Company]].

Movies|url= http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800018940/bio}}</ref> A budding jazz musician, at the age of sixteen years Field became a member of the Big Band at [[Mount Hood Community College]] in Gresham, Oregon. Headed by Larry McVey, the band had become a proving-ground and regular stop for [[Stan Kenton]] and [[Mel Tormé]] when they were looking for new players. It was here Field played trombone along with his friend, trumpeter and future Grammy Award Winner, [[Chris Botti]]. During this same time Field also worked as a non-union projectionist at a second-run movie theater. He graduated with his class from [[Centennial High School (Gresham, Oregon)|Centennial High School]] on Portland's east side and briefly attended Southern Oregon State College (now [[Southern Oregon University]]) in [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]] on a music scholarship, but left after his freshman year favoring a move to New York to study acting. Once there, he began performing with the Ark Theatre Company as both an actor and musician.<ref>Levy, Shawn. You couldn't write a better script. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', March twenty-third, 2002.</ref> Field received his [[Master of Fine Arts]] from the [[AFI Conservatory]].

==Career==
One of the film industry's more multifaceted members, having worked in varying capacities as an actor, director, producer, composer, and screenwriter,<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news|title= Todd Field Biography|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= December 3, 2009}}</ref> Field began making motion pictures in 1985 when he was cast by [[Woody Allen]] in ''[[Radio Days]]''.  He went on to work with some of America's greatest film makers including [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Victor Nuñez]], and [[Carl Franklin]]. It was Franklin and Nunez (both [[American Film Institute|AFI]] alumni) who encouraged Field to enroll as a Directing Fellow at the AFI, which he did in the fall of 1992. Since that time he has received the Franklin J. Schaffner Fellow Award from the AFI, the [[Satyajit Ray]] Award from the [[British Film Institute]], a Jury Prize from the [[Sundance Film Festival]], and his short films have been exhibited at various venues overseas and domestically at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]. To date, unadjusted [[box office]] receipts for the films in which Field has participated exceed a billion dollars worldwide.<ref name="Box Office Mojo">{{cite news|title=Todd Field Worldwide Box Office Totals: In the Bedroom, Little Children, Twister, Radio Days, The Haunting, Gross Anatomy, Eyes Wide Shut, Walking & Talking, Ruby in Paradise, Sleep with Me, The Allnighter, Fat Man & Little Boy, Queens Logic, Frank & Jesse, Stranger than Fiction.

===''In the Bedroom''===
{{main|In the Bedroom}}
[[File:Wilkinson & Spacek.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tom Wilkinson]] and [[Sissy Spacek]] in Field's ''In the Bedroom'' (2001).]]Field became one of Hollywood's hottest new writer/directors with the release of ''[[In the Bedroom]]'', a film based on the short story ''[[Killings]]'' by author [[Andre Dubus]]. (Kubrick and Dubus were among Field's mentors; both died right before the production of ''In the Bedroom''.) ''In the Bedroom'' was nominated for five [[Academy Award]]s including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] ([[Tom Wilkinson]], his first nomination), [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] ([[Sissy Spacek]], her sixth nomination), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Supporting Actress]] ([[Marisa Tomei]], her second nomination), and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay (Adapted)]]. The film was shot in [[Rockland, Maine]], a New England town in which Field resides&mdash;the house where he, his wife (Serena Rathbun), and their four children live was even used as the setting for one sequence.<ref name="Biography - Field, Todd (1964-): An article from: Contemporary Authors ">{{cite news|author= Gale, Thomas|title= Todd Field Biography|work= [[Contemporary Authors]]|date= December 16, 2007}}</ref>
Rathbun and [[Sissy Spacek]] did a portion of the set designing and Field handled the camera himself on many of the shots. The result, critics said, was stunning: [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, {{quote|''"Todd Field exhibits a mastery of his craft many filmmakers never acquire in a lifetime. With one film he’s guaranteed his future as a director. He has the magnificent obsession of the natural-born filmmaker.."''<ref>{{cite news|author= Ansen, David|title= Their House Torn Asunder|work= [[Newsweek]]|date= December 3, 2001}}</ref><ref name="Newsweek2">{{cite news|author= Ansen, David.|title= Break On Through To The Oscar Side.|work= [[Newsweek]]|date= January 21, 2002}}</ref>}}

 Anthony Quinn of ''[[The Independent]]'' also praised the director: {{quote|''"Field has pulled off something here I thought no American filmmaker would ever manage again: he makes violence feel genuinely shocking''."<ref>{{cite news|author= Quinn, Anthony|title= The Big Picture: In the Bedroom|publisher= ''[[The Independent]]''|date= 25 January 2002}}</ref>}}

For his work on ''In the Bedroom'', Field was named ''Director of the Year''  by the [[National Board of Review]], and his script was awarded [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. The film went on to win [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Film|Best Picture]] of the Year by the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]], and the [[New York Film Critics Circle]] awarded Best First Film to Field. ''[[In the Bedroom]]'' received six [[American Film Institute Awards]] including Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, three [[Golden Globe]] nominations, and five [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], Actor, Actress, Supporting Actress, and two individually for Field both as Screenwriter and Producer. The [[American Film Institute]] honored Field with the  [[Franklin Schaffner]] Alumni Medal. With the exception of the AFI [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Life Achievement Award]], the Schaffner Award is the highest honor an individual can achieve.

===''Little Children''===
{{main|Little Children (film)}}
[[File:Perrotta & Field working on the script for Little Children.JPG|thumb|left|[[Tom Perrotta]] and Field working on the script for ''Little Children'', 2005]]
Field followed ''In the Bedroom'' with ''[[Little Children (film)|Little Children]]'', which was nominated for three Academy Awards including two for his actors: [[Kate Winslet]] (her fifth nomination, and with it a record for the youngest actor to be nominated for five Academy Awards) and [[Jackie Earle Haley]] (his first nomination, and first leading role in over fifteen years). After having written, directed and produced just two feature films, Field had garnered five Academy Award nominations for his actors, and three for himself, personally. The film, based on the [[Little Children (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Tom Perrotta]], premiered at the 2006 New York Film Festival. In his end-of-year roundup "Best of 2006", [[A.O. Scott]] of The New York Times wrote: "''The first time you see Todd Field's adaptation of Tom Perrotta's novel, you may remark on the director's impressive control over the unruly source material and the emotional agility of the cast. Kate Winslet in particular. The second time, the film's lurid, crazy side is more apparent, and the intensity of the supporting performances — Noah Emmerich, Jackie Earle Haley, Phyllis Somerville — creep into the foreground. This movie, Mr. Field's second feature... is a complicated blend of gothic, melodrama and sexual comedy, unerringly attuned to the varieties of human failure''."<ref>Scott, A.O. [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/24/movies/24scot.html "Best of 2006: Here's to the Ambitious and the Altmans." ''The New York Times'', December 24, 2006.]</ref>
===Future work===
According to the ''Los Angeles Times'', Field is currently in the process of adapting a film version of [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s novel ''[[Blood Meridian]]''.<ref name="JMedinaLAT">{{cite news |author= Medina, Jeremy|title= Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian film changes directors |publisher= ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date= August 28, 2008 |accessdate= 2008-09-06}}</ref> During the process, Field took over the directing position of [[Ridley Scott]], who was originally scheduled to direct. Scott himself stated that the film would be a tricky film and should be left as a novel.<ref>{{cite news|title= Todd Field still working hard on Blood Meridian|url= http://www.talkingfilms.net/todd-field-still-working-hard-on-blood-meridian|publisher= [[TalkingFilms]]|date= January 14, 2010|accessdate= April 3, 2010}}</ref> Although director [[James Franco]] had taken interest in adapting the novel,<ref name="MTV">{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2012/02/01/ridley-scott-cormac-mccarthy-the-counselor/ |title=Ridley Scott In Talks For Cormac McCarthy's 'Counselor' |author=Kevin P.

According to the ''Los Angeles Times'', Field is currently in the process of preparing his next film, an adaptation of the [[Boston Teran]] novel ''The Creed of Violence''. Actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] is in talks to play the lead role of Rawbone.<ref name="SZeitchikLAT">{{cite news |author= Steven, Zeitchik |title= A Western With Leonardo DiCaprio? |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/07/leonardo-dicaprio-creed-violence-boston-teran.html |publisher= ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date= July 29, 2011 |accessdate= 2011-08-05}}</ref>

At the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]] Field appeared in the documentary film ''[[The Battered Bastards of Baseball]]'', recollecting his early life as a [[batboy]] for the [[Portland Mavericks]], a unique, unaffiliated independent Minor League Baseball team.<ref name="JLabrecqueEW">{{cite news |author= Jeff, Labrecque |title= Sundance 2014: Todd Field looks back on the 'Battered Bastards of Baseball' |url= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/01/22/sundance-todd-field-battered-bastards-of-baseball-exclusive/|publisher= ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|date= January 22, 2014 |accessdate= 2014-03-14}}</ref> According to the ''Hollywood Reporter'', Field is set to write & direct a feature film based on the story.<ref name="JTSiegelBKitHR">{{cite news |author= Tatiana, Siegel * Borys, Kit|title= Sundance Deal Wrap |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sundance-deal-wrap-up-anne-674833/|publisher= ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]''|date= January 29, 2014 |accessdate= 2014-03-14}}</ref>

{{Quote box
| quote  ="Field has a deceptive facade of all-American clean-cut looks that allows him to suggest a wide range of emotions and thoughts behind such a regular-guy appearance; in "Ruby in Paradise" he expressed such uncommon decency and intelligence you had to wonder how Ashley Judd's hardscrabble Ruby could ever have considered letting him get away. In "Eyes Wide Shut" he's the likable med school dropout turned saloon piano player, and here he's an increasingly raging sociopath. In all these roles Field has the precious gift of being able to surprise you and to command your attention on screen."<ref>{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Kevin |title=Movie Review: Broken Vessels |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie990729-3,0,103310.story |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 30, 1999}}</ref></blockquote>
