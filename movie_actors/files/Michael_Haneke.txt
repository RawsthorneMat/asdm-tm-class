'''Michael Haneke''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmɪçaːʔeːl ˈhaːnəkə|lang}}; born 23 March 1942) is an Austrian [[film director]] and [[screenwriter]] best known for films such as ''[[Caché (film)|Caché]]'', ''[[Funny Games (1997 film)|Funny Games]]'', ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' and ''[[Amour (2012 film)|Amour]]''. His films often document the discontent and estrangement experienced by individuals in modern society. Haneke has worked in [[television]]‚ [[theatre]] and [[Film|cinema]]. He is also known for raising social issues in his work.<ref>{{cite news |first= John|last= Wray|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Minister of Fear. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/magazine/23haneke-t.html |quote=Making waves, however, is what Haneke has become famous for. Over the last two decades, the director has developed a reputation for stark, often brutal films that place the viewer – sometimes subtly, sometimes explicitly – in the uncomfortable role of accomplice to the crimes playing out on-screen. This approach has made Haneke one of contemporary cinema's most reviled and revered figures, earning him everything from accusations of obscenity to a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. ''Funny Games'', the movie Haneke was shooting in New York and Long Island, is the American remake of a highly controversial film by the same name that he directed in 1997.|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=September 23, 2007|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref> Besides working as a filmmaker he also teaches directing at the [[Filmacademy Vienna|Film Academy Vienna]].

At the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]], his film ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] for best film, and at the [[67th Golden Globe Awards]] the film won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. In 2012, his film ''[[Amour (2012 film)|Amour]]'' premiered and competed at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="Official Selection">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/58878.html |title=2012 Official Selection |accessdate=2012-04-19 |publisher=Cannes Festival}}</ref><ref name="timeout">{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2547/cannes-film-festival-2012-line-up-announced |title=Cannes Film Festival 2012 line-up announced |accessdate=2012-04-19 |work=timeout}}</ref> The film would go on to win the Palme d'Or, making it his second win of the prestigious award in three years and putting him in an elite club with only six other directors to have won the award twice. He is the only Austrian director to have accomplished this.<ref name="PalmeDor2012">{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/2012/awardCompetition.html |title=Awards 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-27|publisher=Cannes Festival}}</ref> The film received five [[Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for [[Emmanuelle Riva]].<ref name="85thNominees">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20959604 |title=Oscars: Hollywood announces 85th Academy Award nominations |accessdate=2013-01-10|publisher=BBC News |date=2013-01-10}}</ref> It won in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]. Haneke has made films in French, German and in English.

In 2013 Haneke won the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for the arts.

==Life and career==
Haneke was born in Munich, Germany, the son of the German actor and director Fritz Haneke and the Austrian actress Beatrix von Degenschild. His stepfather, the composer {{ill|de|Alexander Steinbrecher}}, had later married the mother of actor [[Christoph Waltz]].<ref>In his second marriage, the composer Alexander Steinbrecher was married to Degenschild. After her death he married {{ill|de|Elisabeth Urbancic}}, the mother of Waltz. So Steinbrecher is the stepfather of both Haneke and Waltz.</ref> Haneke was raised in the city of [[Wiener Neustadt]], Austria, and later attended the [[University of Vienna]] to study [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[drama]] after failing to achieve success in his early attempts in acting and music. After graduating, he became a film critic and from 1967 to 1970 he worked as editor and dramaturg at the southwestern German television station [[Südwestfunk]]. He made his debut as a television director in 1974.

Haneke's feature film debut was 1989's ''[[The Seventh Continent (1989 film)|The Seventh Continent]]'', which served to trace out the violent and bold style that would bloom in later years. Three years later, the controversial ''[[Benny's Video]]'' put Haneke's name on the map. Haneke achieved great success in 2001 with the critically successful French film ''[[The Piano Teacher (film)|The Piano Teacher]]''. It won the prestigious [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prize]] at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]] and also won its stars, [[Benoît Magimel]] and [[Isabelle Huppert]], the Best Actor and Actress awards. He has worked with [[Juliette Binoche]] (''[[Code Unknown]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Caché (film)|Caché]]'' in 2005), after she expressed interest in working with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/2097 |title=Sight & Sound &#124; Code Unknown (2000) |publisher=BFI |date=2010-07-08 |accessdate=Jan 22, 2014}}</ref> Haneke frequently worked with real-life couple [[Ulrich Mühe]] and [[Susanne Lothar]] - thrice each.

His film, ''[[The White Ribbon]]'', premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The film is set in 1913 and deals with strange incidents in a small town in Northern Germany, depicting an authoritarian, fascist-like atmosphere, where children are subjected to rigid rules and suffer harsh punishments, and where strange deaths occur. The Cannes Jury presided by [[Isabelle Huppert]] and including [[Asia Argento]], [[Hanif Kureishi]] and [[Robin Wright|Robin Wright Penn]] awarded Haneke's film the Palme d'Or for the best feature film. In 2012, his film ''[[Amour (2012 film)|Amour]]'' also won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. So Haneke joined just 7 other filmmakers to have won the prestigious award twice: [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Shōhei Imamura]], [[Dardenne brothers|the Dardenne brothers]], [[Alf Sjöberg]], [[Bille August]] and [[Emir Kusturica]].

Haneke says that films should offer viewers more space for imagination and self-reflection. Films that have too much detail and moral clarity, Haneke says, are used for mindless consumption by their viewers. It is often difficult for people to ascertain Haneke's philosophy and the exact messages he wishes to illustrate in his works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9jvoAq0it0/ |title=Michael Haneke Interviewed by Alexander Kluge - News und Stories (eng subtitles by dctp)|publisher=ProSiebenSat.1 Media |date=2008-06-23 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>

His 2012 film ''[[Amour (2012 film)|Amour]]'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Oscar]] and was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar at the [[85th Academy Awards]].<ref name="85thNominees" /> In 2013 he was the subject of the documentary film ''[[Michael H – Profession: Director]]''.<ref name="DocGuardian">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/mar/14/michael-h-profession-director-review |title=Michael H – Profession: Director |accessdate=2013-03-15 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |date=2013-03-14}}</ref><ref name="DocTimeout">{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/michael-h-profession-director |title=Michael H., Profession: Director |accessdate=2013-03-15 |work=Timeout}}</ref>

===Stage work===
Haneke has directed a number of stage productions in German, which include works by [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], and [[Heinrich von Kleist]] in Berlin, Munich and Vienna. In 2006 he gave his debut as an [[opera]] director, staging [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' for the [[Opéra National de Paris]] at [[Palais Garnier]] when the theater's general manager was [[Gerard Mortier]]. In 2012, he was to direct ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' for the [[New York City Opera]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metoperafamily.org/operanews/news/pressrelease.aspx?id=1508 |title=Opera News > The Met Opera Guild |publisher=Metoperafamily.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref> This production had originally been commissioned by [[Jürgen Flimm]] for the [[Salzburg Festival]] 2009, but Haneke had to resign due to an illness preventing him from preparing the work. Haneke realized this production at Madrid's [[Teatro Real]] in 2013.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/arts/06iht-loomis06.html "Giving ''Così fan tutte'' a Little Extra Gravity"] by George Loomis, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 5 March 2013</ref>

==Quotes==
:"My films are intended as polemical statements against the American 'barrel down' cinema and its dis-empowerment of the spectator. They are an appeal for a cinema of insistent questions instead of false (because too quick) answers, for clarifying distance in place of violating closeness, for provocation and dialogue instead of consumption and consensus."
::—From "Film as catharsis".<ref>Haneke, Michael – "{{Lang|de|Film als Katharsis}}": in ''Austria (in)felix: zum österreichischem Film der 80er Jahre'' – Bono, Francesco (ed.), 1992. ISBN 3-901272-00-3</ref>

:"Pornography, it seems to me, is no different from war films or propaganda films in that it tries to make the visceral, horrific, or transgressive elements of life consumable. Propaganda is far more pornographic than a home video of two people fucking."<ref>{{cite web|author=Christopher Sharrett |url=http://www.kinoeye.org/04/01/interview01.php |title=Austrian film: Michael Haneke interviewed |publisher=Kinoeye |date= |accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref>

:"Film is 24 lies per second at the service of truth, or at the service of the attempt to find the truth."

:"My favourite film-maker of the decade is [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. He achieves a simplicity that's so difficult to attain."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6905956.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Michael Haneke Its super to be number one | first=Ruth | last=Lewy | date=November 7, 2009 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>

:"I do think that our perception of reality is fragmentary, and in 20th-century literature, it's totally normal to not describe reality as something whole and completely transportable and explicable. That's been accepted in novels. But genre films always pretend that reality is transportable, which means that it is explicable."<ref>Lawrence, Chua.
