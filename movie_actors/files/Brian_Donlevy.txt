'''Waldo Brian Donlevy''' (February 9, 1901&nbsp;– April 5, 1972), later known as '''Brian Donlevy''', was an American actor, noted for playing dangerous tough guys from the 1930s to the 1960s. He usually appeared in supporting roles. Among his best-known films are ''[[Beau Geste (1939 film)|Beau Geste]]'' (1939) and ''[[The Great McGinty]]'' (1940). For his role as Sergeant Markoff in ''Beau Geste'' he was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

Donlevy starred as US special agent Steve Mitchell in 40 episodes of the 1952 TV series "Dangerous Assignment". Mitchell received assignments to exotic locales involving international intrigue from 'The Commissioner' played by Hubert Butterfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044257/ |title=Dangerous Assignment |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044257/fullcredits#staff |title=Full cast and crew for "Dangerous Assignment" |deadurl=no |accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>  

His obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper in the United Kingdom stated that "any consideration of the American '[[film noir]]' of the 1940s would be incomplete without him".<ref name="times">{{cite news|title=Brian Donlevy&nbsp;– A Famous Film Tough Guy|work=The Times|date=April 7, 1972|page=16}}</ref>

==Early life and military service==
Donlevy was born in 1901 in [[Ohio]], the son of Rebecca (Parks) and Thomas Donlevy.<ref>http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Dangerous-Assignment.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Year: 1920; Census Place: Sheboygan Falls, Sheboygan, Wisconsin; Roll: T625_2017; Page: 26B; Enumeration District: 148; Image: 431.|url=http://search.ancestry.com/iexec?htx=View&r=an&dbid=6061&iid=4390350_00431&fn=Thomas&ln=Donlevy&st=d&ssrc=&pid=37970292|work=1920 United States Federal Census [database on-line].|publisher=Ancestry.com|accessdate=June 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mank|first=Gregory|title=Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff: The Expanded Story of a Haunting Collaboration, with a Complete Filmography of Their Films Together|year=2009|publisher=MacFarland & Co., Inc.|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=0786434805|page=658}}</ref> Sometime between 1910 and 1912 the family moved to [[Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin]],<ref>{{cite web|title="Milwaukee Journal", August 10, 1944|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19440810&id=FQMaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=piMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2226,3522514|publisher=Google News Archive|accessdate=June 4, 2012}}</ref> where Donlevy's father worked as a supervisor at the Brickner Woolen Mills.<ref name="Sheboygan Press, January 29, 1931"/> When the local [[Army National Guard]] company was called into service for the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] in 1916, Donlevy lied about his age (he was actually 14) so he could join the mobilization. Donlevy served during [[Pancho Villa Expedition|the expedition]] as a bugler. When the United States entered [[World War I]], Donlevy went to France with Company C, [[127th Infantry Regiment (United States)|127th Infantry Regiment]], a part of the [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd Infantry Division]].

==Acting career==
[[File:Brian-Donlevy-Esther-Fernandez-Alan-Ladd-Two-Years-Before-the-Mast.jpg|thumb|left|Donlevy with [[Esther Fernández]] and [[Alan Ladd]] in ''[[Two Years Before the Mast (film)|Two Years Before the Mast]]'' (1946).]]
Donlevy began his career in [[New York City|New York]] in the early 1920s, appearing in many [[theater]] productions and also winning an increasing number of [[silent film]] parts. Previously, he had modeled for the illustrator [[J.C. Leyendecker]], who produced illustrations for the famous [[Cluett Peabody & Company|Arrow Collar]] advertisements. His [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] credits included ''[[Hit the Deck (musical)|Hit the Deck]]'' and ''[[Life Begins at 8:40]]''.

Donlevy's break came in 1935, when he was cast in the [[Edward G. Robinson]] film ''[[Barbary Coast (film)|Barbary Coast]]''. A large amount of film work followed, with several important parts. In 1939, he played the lead villain in ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his memorable role as the ruthless Sergeant Markoff in ''[[Beau Geste (1939 film)|Beau Geste]]'', although the Oscar went to [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] for ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]''.

The following year, he played the role for which he is perhaps best remembered, that of McGinty in ''[[The Great McGinty]]'', a role he reprised four years later in ''[[The Miracle of Morgan's Creek]]''. In 1942, Donlevy starred in ''[[Wake Island (1942 film)|Wake Island]]'' with William Bendix and Robert Preston and played street-tough borough politician Paul Madvig in Dashiell Hammet's classic ''[[The Glass Key (1942 film)|The Glass Key]]''. In 1955, he played the lead in the British [[Science fiction film|science-fiction]] [[horror film]] ''[[The Quatermass Xperiment]]'' (called ''The Creeping Unknown'' in the US) for the [[Hammer Films]] company, playing the lead role of Professor [[Bernard Quatermass]]. The film was based on a 1953 [[BBC One|BBC Television]] serial [[The Quatermass Experiment|of the same name]]. The character had been British, but Hammer cast Donlevy in an attempt to help sell the film to North American audiences. Quatermass creator [[Nigel Kneale]] disliked Donlevy's portrayal, referring to Donlevy as "a former Hollywood heavy gone to seed". Nonetheless, the film version was a success and Donlevy returned for the sequel, ''[[Quatermass 2]]'' (''Enemy From Space'' in the US), in 1957, also based on a [[Quatermass II|BBC television serial]]. This made Donlevy the only man ever to play the famous scientist on screen twice, although Scottish actor [[Andrew Keir]] would later play him both on film and on radio.

Throughout his film career, Donlevy also did several radio shows, including a reprise of ''The Great McGinty''. He played the lead character in ''Dangerous Assignment'' between 1949 and 1954, taking the series to TV in 1952. He featured in a number of films over the following years until his death. He also appeared in a variety of television series from the late 1940s until the mid-1960s. In 1966 in one of the final episodes of ''[[Perry Mason]]'', "The Case of the Positive Negative," Donlevy played defendant General Roger Brandon.  He also guest-starred on such popular programs as ''[[Crossroads (1955 TV series)|Crossroads]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]],''. In 1957, he appeared in a [[CBS]] [[Beyond This Place (1957)|production]] of [[A. J. Cronin]]'s ''[[Beyond This Place]]''. In 1960, he appeared as John Ridges in the episode "Escape" of [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s [[anthology series]] ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]'', with [[Sylvia Sidney]] portraying his wife. His last film role was in ''[[Pit Stop (1969 film)|Pit Stop]]'', released in 1969.

==Personal life==
Donlevy was married three times: first to Yvonne Grey from 1928–36, then to actress [[Marjorie Lane]] from 1936–1947, and finally to Lillian Arch Lugosi (the ex-wife of [[Bela Lugosi]], famous for playing [[Dracula]]) from 1966 until his death in 1972.

Donlevy died from [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] on April 5, 1972 at the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Country Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, California]].<ref name="Bangor Daily News-April 7, 1972">{{cite news |title=Brian Donlevy Dies Of Cancer |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NiM0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=L-EIAAAAIBAJ&pg=3705%2C2167587 |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=Bangor Daily News |location=Bangor, Maine |date=April 7, 1972 |page=5 |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}</ref> He was survived by his wife and a daughter, Judy Donlevy, by his second wife. His ashes were scattered over [[Santa Monica Bay]].
