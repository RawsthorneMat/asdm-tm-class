Washington attended [[Pennington-Grimes Elementary School]] in Mount Vernon until 1968.

"That decision changed my life," Washington later said, "because I wouldn't have survived in the direction I was going. The guys I was hanging out with at the time, my running buddies, have now done maybe 40 years combined in the penitentiary. They were nice guys, but the streets got them."<ref>{{cite news |last=Rader |first=Dodson |date=December 12, 1999 |title=I Try To Send A Good Message |url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/1999/edition_12-12-1999/Denzel_Washington |deadurl=yes |newspaper=Parade Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060411214059/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/1999/edition_12-12-1999/Denzel_Washington |archivedate=April 11, 2006 |accessdate= March 12, 2014}}</ref> After Oakland, Washington next attended [[Mainland High School]], a public high school in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], from 1970 to 1971.<ref name="bookref1"/> He was interested in attending [[Texas Tech University]]: "I grew up in the [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys Club]] in Mount Vernon, and we were the Red Raiders.
