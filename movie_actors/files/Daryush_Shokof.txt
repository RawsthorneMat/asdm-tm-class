'''Daryush Shokof''' (Persian: داریوش شکوف) (born Ali Reza Shokoufandeh) is an Iranian [[artist]], [[philosopher]], [[film director]], [[writer]], and [[film producer]]. He was born in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]], but lives in [[Germany]].
Daryush Shokof was Born in 1954 in Tehran, Iran. He went to Kharazmi high school. Shokof Graduated from E.N.M.U., [[Eastern New Mexico University]] in the [[U.S.A.]] in [[Physics]] and [[Mathematics]]. He further received master's degree in business management, [[M.B.A.]] from U.D. in [[Texas]], [[USA]]. Thereafter he attended arts and film in [[New York University]].

==Films==

Shokof made his first movie, a short experimental film called ''Angels are Wired'', in 1991. Since then he has made over 25 short and feature-length films and has written over 50 film scripts, some of which he made into movies himself.

Shokof's films have all been made independent of any studio contract[citation needed]. His film [[Venussian Tabutasco]] was shot entirely in a glass elevator and [[Tenussian Vaccuvasco]] was shot through the windows of an apartment block.though he continues making experimental films, and believes the future of cinema lays in [[experimental films]] he simultaneously does take on more standard styles of story telling with such main stream movies like "Hitler's Grave" with [[Vadim Glowna]], and or "A2Z" with [[Jack Taylor (actor)|Jack Taylor]] acting in the lead role alongside Narges Rashidi playing in her film debut role as the [[lolita]].

However, and regardless of different styles of filmmaking and or genre of films shokof has made it is always clear and obvious that he leaves his mark as an original film maker.

His film, [[Breathful]], was a gangster-comedy film with an all-woman cast. The film is dedicated to the rights of women worldwide and more specifically to the freedom and rights of women in his own homeland Iran. The film reflects Shokof's belief that Iran is ruled by a brutal dictatorial Islamic republic regime which ignores the many basic rights of Iranian women. His comedy feature [[Flushers]] was shot entirely in a toilet, and Wordlessness was a complete wordless feature in 2012, in Berlin, Germany.he developed "amenic film" under which his last five feature films have been made including "flushers" and "wordlessness".he described the principle of making an amenic film is that one first shoots the film based on a solid concept and then writes the script according to the finished film.
It is the process of searching for meaning through the camera and the emotional events that are unfolding in a real way before you.  There is an aspect of control and then a letting go of control so that life can come in and inform the story and the visual events in a more surprising and real way than we could make happen otherwise.  The key is staying awake and aware through the process in order to recognize important moments and get the proper coverage around them.  Of course the true poets remain the people who do the editing afterwards.

A retrospective of his films was shown at the Babylon Theatre in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] in May 2014.<ref>http://www.babylonberlin.de/shokof.htm</ref>

==Alleged kidnapping==

Shokof claimed that he was kidnapped by four [[terrorism|terrorists]] in the city of Cologne, Germany, in late May 2010, and was kept for over twelve days in the hands of four [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking men. German police denied his statement and told the press that this story was not verifiable, and might have been staged to attract attention.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/2010/06/100617_u01-filmmaker.shtml</ref><ref>http://www.rundschau-online.de/lokales/wende-im-fall-shokof-entfuehrung-war-vorgetaeuscht,15185494,15331088.html</ref>
