'''Henry George "Dobe" Carey, Jr.''' (May 16, 1921&nbsp;– December 27, 2012), known as '''Harry Carey, Jr.''', was an [[Americans|American]] actor. He appeared in more than ninety films including several [[John Ford]] [[Western (genre)|westerns]] as well as numerous [[television series]].

==Early life==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Harry Carey, Jr. was born in the [[Saugus, Santa Clarita, California|Saugus]] neighborhood of [[Santa Clarita, California]], the son of actor [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]] (1878–1947) and actress [[Olive Carey]] (1896–1988). His maternal grandfather was vaudeville entertainer [[George Fuller Golden]]. As a boy, he was nicknamed "Dobe", short for adobe, because of the color of his hair. He served with the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]].

==Career==
A respected [[character actor]] like his father, Carey appeared in several [[Western film|Westerns]]. He made four films with director [[Howard Hawks]]. The first was ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', which featured both Carey and his father in separate scenes, followed by ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'', ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', and ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]''. Carey is credited in ''Rio Bravo'' but his scenes were cut. Carey speculated that Hawks either did not like Carey's outfit or cut the scene because Carey addressed Hawks as  "Howard," instead of "Mr. Hawks."<ref name="joyner2009">Joyner, C. Courtney (2009). ''Westerners: Interviews With Actors, Directors, Writers and Producers.'' McFarland, ISBN 9780786443031</ref>

Carey made eleven films with  [[John Wayne]], starting with ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' and ending with ''[[Cahill U.S. Marshal]]''.

Carey collaborated frequently with director John Ford, a close friend, and became a regular in what was commonly called the [[John Ford Stock Company]]. He appeared in such notable Ford films as ''[[3 Godfathers]]'' (1948), ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'' (1949), ''[[Wagon Master]]'' (1950), ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]'' (1950), ''[[The Long Gray Line]]'' (1955); ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'' (1955), ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956),  ''[[Two Rode Together]]'' (1961), and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1964). Carey wrote a book about his experiences working with Ford titled ''Company of Heroes: My Life as an Actor in the John Ford Stock Company'', published in 1994.

Between 1955 and 1957, Carey appeared as ranch counselor Bill Burnett in the serial ''[[Spin and Marty]]'', seen on [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club|Mickey Mouse Club]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spin and Marty review |publisher=Atlas Communications |date=June 2006 |url=http://www.atlascom.us/spin_mar.htm |accessdate=2009-02-25}}</ref> A [[DVD]] version of [[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Five#The Adventures of Spin & Marty (The Mickey Mouse Club)|''The Adventures of Spin & Marty'']] was released in December 2005 as part of the ''[[Walt Disney Treasures]]'' series. Carey was interviewed by [[Leonard Maltin]] on the 50th anniversary of the series' debut as a DVD bonus feature.

In the 1960s, Carey appeared on such western series as ''[[Have Gun - Will Travel]]'', ''[[The Legend of Jesse James (TV series)|The Legend of Jesse James]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'',''[[The Rifleman]]'', ''[[Gray Ghost (TV series)|Gray Ghost]]'', ''[[Whispering Smith (TV series)|Whispering Smith]]'', ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'', ''[[Stoney Burke (TV series)|Stoney Burke]]'', ''[[Redigo (TV series)|Redigo]]'', ''[[The Rounders (TV series)|The Rounders]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.

On April 29, 1962, Carey was cast as Mitch Evers in the episode "Cort" of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-[[Warner Brothers|WB]] western series, ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', with [[John Russell (actor)|John Russell]] and [[Peter Brown (actor)|Peter Brown]]. In the story line, Cort Evers ([[Kevin Hagen]]), who is much younger than he appears, seeks revenge against his brother Mitch, whom he mistakenly blames for betraying six [[Union Army]] prisoners from their hometown during the [[American Civil War]]. Mitch is compelled to contront Cort in a shootout during which he explains that it had been Cort himself, under the influence of a fever, who betrayed the prisoners. Cort faints to the ground as he remembers the startling truth of his brother's words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0629942/|title="Cort" (April 29, 1962)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

In 1980, Carey portrayed George Arthur in the movie ''[[The Long Riders]]'', a film about the exploits of [[Jesse James]]. In 1985, Carey played the aging biker "Red" in the movie ''[[Mask (film)|Mask]]''.

In 1987, Carey was a featured actor in the film, ''[[The Whales of August]]'', with [[Bette Davis]], [[Lillian Gish]], [[Vincent Price]], and [[Ann Sothern]]. In this film, Carey portrayed good natured and noisy handyman and delivered his lines in a perfect [[Maine]] accent.

In 1990, Carey appeared in the film ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' in a saloon scene set in 1885. In 1993, he made a cameo in the film ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' as Marshal [[Fred White (marshal)|Fred White]].

Carey appeared in ''Tales from the Set'', a series of video interviews in which he discussed various individuals with whom he worked.  The series debuted in [[France]] at the [[Epona Festival]], an event devoted to horses, in October 2007. In 2009, Carey and his partner Clyde Lucas completed ''Trader Horn: The Journey Back'', a remembrance of the 1931 adventure film featuring the elder Carey. The younger Carey accompanied his father to [[Africa]] for the filming, the first motion picture filmed on the African continent by a major studio.

Carey attempted to produce a feature film called ''Comanche Stallion'', a project which John Ford had considered making in the early 1960s, based on the 1958 book by Tom Millstead.

In 1944, he married Marilyn Fix, the daughter of actor [[Paul Fix]].<ref>{{IMDb name|1013|section=bio|Harry Carey Jr.}}</ref> Carey died of natural causes on December 27, 2012, in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], California, at the age of ninety-one.<ref>{{cite web|title=Western movie character actor Harry Carey Jr. dies at 91|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/29/entertainment-us-usa-people-harrycarey-idUSBRE8BS02H20121229|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=29 December 2012}}</ref> His entombment was at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]].<ref>http://www.uscemeteryproj.com/california/losangeles/westwood/cwestwood.htm</ref>
