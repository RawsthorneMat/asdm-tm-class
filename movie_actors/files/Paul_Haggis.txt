''[[The Observer]]'' commented on defections of Haggis and actor [[Jason Beghe]] from Scientology, "The decision of Beghe and Haggis to quit Scientology appears to have caused the movement its greatest recent PR difficulties, not least because of its dependence on Hollywood figures as both a source of revenue for its most expensive courses and an advertisement for the religion."<ref>{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Beaumont |author2=Toni O'Loughlin |author3=Paul Harris  |authorlink= | title= Celebrities lead charge against Scientology: Hollywood figures quit 'rip-off' church as Australian prime minister threatens parliamentary inquiry into its activities | date=November 22, 2009 | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/22/scientology-cruise-haggis-us-australia | work =[[The Observer]] | pages = | accessdate = November 22, 2009 | language = }}</ref>
