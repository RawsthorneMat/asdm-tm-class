[[Malay styles and titles#Tan Sri|Tan Sri]] '''Michelle Yeoh Choo-Kheng''' (born 6 August 1962<ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica Almanac 2010, [http://books.google.de/books?id=kd2bAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA75 p. 75]</ref>) is a [[Malaysia]]n actress, best known for performing her own stunts in the [[Hong Kong action films]] that brought her to fame in the early 1990s. Born in [[Ipoh]], Malaysia, she was chosen by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' as one of the "[[50 Most Beautiful People in the World]]" in 1997.

She is best known in the Western world for her roles in the 1997 [[James Bond]] film ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', playing [[Wai Lin]], and the multiple [[Academy Award]]-winning Chinese-language martial arts film ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best Actress]] in [[54th British Academy Film Awards|2000]]. In 2008, the film critic website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] ranked her the greatest action heroine of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wanted/news/1737200/13/total_recall_the_25_best_action_heroines_of_all_time |title=Total Recall: The 25 Best Action Heroines of All Time |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> In 2009, she was listed by ''[[People (magazine)|People magazine]]''&nbsp;– as the only Asian actress&nbsp;– as one of the "35 All-Time Screen Beauties".<ref>{{cite journal |date=6 October 2009 |url=http://www.people.com/people/package/gallery/0,,20301963_20308766,00.html#20682740 |title=35 All-Time Screen Beauties: Michelle Yeoh |work=[[People magazine]] |issn=0093-7673 |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref>

She is credited as '''Michelle Khan''' in some of her earlier films. This alias was chosen by the D&B studio who thought it might be more marketable to international and western audiences. Yeoh later preferred using her real name.<ref name="KeeHuaChee-2004">{{cite web |author=Kee Hua Chee |date=19 January 2004 |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2004/1/10/features/7041578&sec=features |title=Her own person |work=The Star |location=Malaysia |accessdate=13 November 2011 |postscript=. Interview.}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
Yeoh was born to a Malaysian Chinese family in [[Ipoh]], Malaysia. Her parents are Janet Yeoh and Yeoh Kian Geik, a lawyer and [[Malaysian Chinese Association|MCA]] politician.<ref name="filmreference-bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/49/Michelle-Yeoh.html |title=Michelle Yeoh Biography (1962–) |work=film reference |accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> She is a [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]].<ref>[http://michelleyeoh.info/Bio/qa.html Site]</ref> She was keen on dance from an early age, beginning ballet at the age of four. At the age of 15, she moved with her parents to England, where she was enrolled in a boarding school. Yeoh later studied at the [[Royal Academy of Dance]] in London, majoring in ballet. However, a spinal injury prevented her from becoming a professional ballet dancer, and she transferred her attention to choreography and other arts. She later received a B.A. degree in Creative Arts with a minor in Drama.

In 1983, at the age of 20, Yeoh won the [[Miss Malaysia]] [[beauty contest|beauty pageant]].<ref name="KeeHuaChee-2004"/> She represented Malaysia at the Queen of the Pacific 1983 beauty pageant which was held in Australia and won the crown. She was also Malaysia's representative at the 1983 [[Miss World]] pageant in London. From there, she appeared in a television commercial with [[Jackie Chan]] which caught the attention of a fledgling Hong Kong film production company, D&B Films. Yeoh started her film career acting in action and [[martial arts film]]s such as ''[[Yes, Madam]]'' in 1985, after which she did most of her own [[stunt]]s.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Tourtellotte |first=Bob |date=2 August 2008 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/02/us-yeoh-idUSN0240960320080802?sp=true |title=Michelle Yeoh brings kicks and poise to 'Mummy' | work=Reuters |accessdate=15 May 2011 |quote=Yeoh said that as she grows older, she understands her body will not be able to do what it once did with kick boxing and stunts.}}</ref>
The D&B Group in Hong Kong was run by [[Dickson Poon]]. Yeoh married Poon in 1987 and retired from acting. After the couple divorced in 1992, Yeoh returned to acting.<ref name="KeeHuaChee-2004"/>
