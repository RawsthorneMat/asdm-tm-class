==Early life and education==

Pennell was born in [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]] to entrepreneur Harold Pennell and homemaker Ruth Pennell.<ref name=PennelObitbook/> His parents moved to [[Niagara Falls, New York]] during the [[Great Depression]] in search of better opportunities. After a short time in New York, the family moved to California where they lived in a studio apartment overlooking [[Angels Flight]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].<ref name=CNewsPaper>{{cite news|title=Sold Papers to Stars, Now An Actor Too|publisher=Citizen News|date=4 May 1954|location=Hollywood, California|page=11}}</ref> His family moved again when he was still young, purchasing a home near [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]] in [[Hollywood, California]]. He became a newsboy on the studio lot, but athletics distracted him from any early interest in film.<ref name=CNewsPaper/>

Pennell played baseball throughout his youth. He attended [[Hollywood High School]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Vernon|title=Actor Would Fight For Film Part|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&dat=19570919&id=4pguAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RkgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5389,3989645|accessdate=16 October 2014|publisher=The Desert News|date=19 September 1957}}</ref> where he played first baseman and was later inducted into the school's athletic hall of fame. He was recruited by [[Rod Dedeaux]] to play baseball at [[University of Southern California|USC]] where he played beginning in 1947.<ref name=MJournalPenne1stUp/> Pennell attended the university on a full baseball scholarship and became one of the school's all-time letter winners.<ref>{{cite web|title=All-Time Baseball Letter Winners|url=http://www.usctrojans.com/sports/m-basebl/archive/usc-m-basebl-lettermen.html|website=University of Southern California Trojans|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref> He left school early to play professionally for the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Coaches Want Protection From OB|url=|accessdate=|publisher=New York NY PM|date=7 January 1948}}</ref>

==Baseball career==

Just shy of graduating from USC, Pennell left the university to play professionally for the Boston Braves. During his time with the Braves, his teammates often referred to him as "Bud", a nickname that stuck with him throughout his life. He was with the organization for a total of seven seasons between 1948 and 1954, playing first base and outfield for the [[Evansville Braves]], Boston's minor league affiliate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Blow Comes In Eighth With One On|publisher=Evansville Press (no link available)|date=19 May 1949}}</ref>

==Acting career==
[[File:Larry Pennell as General Jack O Neal Old Surehand.png|thumb|left|Larry Pennell as General Jack O' Neal in Old Surehand.]]
In the baseball off-seasons, Pennell would return home to Hollywood, where the entertainment industry was omnipresent.<ref name=DesertNewsLosesBaseball/> As the seasons passed his interest in the industry and acting in particular continued to evolve.
