'''Ermes Effron Borgnino''', known as '''Ernest Borgnine''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔr|ɡ|n|aɪ|n}}; January 24, 1917&nbsp;– July 8, 2012) was an American film and television actor whose career spanned more than six decades. He was an unconventional lead in many films of the 1950s, winning the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in 1955 for ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]''. On television, he played Quinton McHale in the 1962–1966 series ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' and co-starred in the mid-1980s action series ''[[Airwolf]]'', in addition to a wide variety of other roles. Borgnine earned an [[Emmy Award]] nomination at age 92 for his work on the series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''. He was also known for being the original voice of [[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy#Mermaid Man|Mermaid Man]] on ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' from 1999 to 2012.

==Early life==
Ernest Borgnine was born '''Ermes Effron Borgnino''' ({{IPA-it|borˈɲiːno}}) on January 24, 1917, in [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden]], [[Connecticut]].<ref name="dictionary">{{cite encyclopedia| title=Ernest Borgnine| encyclopedia=International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers 4th Ed.| volume=3: Actors and Actresses| publisher=St. James Press| year=2000| place=Reproduced in Biography Resource Center.

Borgnine's parents separated when he was two years old, and he and his mother lived in Italy for about 4 1/2  years. By 1923, his parents had reconciled, the family name was changed from Borgnino to Borgnine, and his father changed his first name to Charles. Ernest had a sister, Evelyn Borgnine Velardi (1925–2013).<ref>{{cite web|title=Evelyn Velardi Obituary: View Obituary for Evelyn Velardi by Mt.

==Naval service==
[[File:Ernest-Borgnine 2004.JPEG|thumb|right|upright|Borgnine wearing a chief petty officer's cap in October 2004.]]
Borgnine joined the [[United States Navy]] in October 1935, after graduation from [[James Hillhouse High School]]<ref name="ctmag">{{cite news| title=Q & A: Ernest Borgnine| url=http://www.connecticutmag.com/Connecticut-Magazine/October-2010/Q-amp-A-Ernest-Borgnine/| work=Connecticut magazine| date=October 2010| author=Pat Grandjean| accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref> in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

===World War II===
In January 1942, he reenlisted in the Navy after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. During the war, he patrolled the Atlantic Coast on an [[antisubmarine warfare]] ship, the USS ''Sylph'' (PY-12).<ref>http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/s21/Sylph-iv.htm</ref> In September 1945, he was honorably discharged from the Navy. He served a total of almost ten years in the Navy and obtained the rank of [[gunner's mate]] 1st class.

===Awards and honors===
Borgnine's military awards include the Navy [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Good Conduct Medal]], [[American Defense Service Medal]] with Fleet Clasp, [[American Campaign Medal]] with bronze star, and the [[World War II Victory Medal (United States)|World War II Victory Medal]].<ref name="navy.mil"/>

In 1997, Borgnine received the United States Navy Memorial, Lone Sailor Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navymemorial.org/lone-sailor-award-recipients|title=Lone Sailor Award Recipients|work=navymemorial.org}}</ref>

On December 7, 2000, Borgnine was named the Veterans Foundation's Veteran of the Year.

In October 2004, Borgnine received the honorary title of [[chief petty officer]] from [[Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy]] [[Terry D. Scott]]. The ceremony for Borgnine's naval advancement was held at the [[United States Navy Memorial|U.S. Navy Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. He received the special honor for his naval service and support of the Navy and navy families worldwide.<ref name="CNN">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/08/showbiz/obit-borgnine/index.html| title=Actor Ernest Borgnine dead at 95| publisher=[[CNN]]| date=8 July 2012| accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref><ref name="chief">{{cite press release| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ernest-borgnine-makes-chief-74378102.html| title=Ernest Borgnine Makes Chief| publisher=U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation| date=18 October 2004| accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref>

==Acting career==
Borgnine returned to his parents house in Connecticut after his Navy discharge without a job to go back to and no direction. In a British Film Institute interview about his life and career, he said:

{{quote|After World War II, we wanted no more part in war. I didn't even want to be a boy-scout. I went home and said that I was through with the Navy and so now, what do we do? So I went home to mother, and after a few weeks of patting me on the back and, "You did good," and everything else, one day she said, "Well?" like mothers do. Which meant, "Alright, you gonna get a job or what?"<ref name="bfi.org.uk">{{cite web| url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/live/video/12| title=Marty + Ernest Borgnine in Conversation| series=In Conversation| publisher=[[British Film Institute]]| date=10 October 2007| accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref>}}

He took a local factory job, but was unwilling to settle down to that kind of work. His mother encouraged him to pursue a more glamorous profession and suggested to him that his personality would be well suited for the stage. He surprised his mother by taking the suggestion to heart, although his father was far from enthusiastic. In 2011, Borgnine remembered,

{{quote|She said, "You always like getting in front of people and making a fool of yourself, why don't you give it a try?" I was sitting at the kitchen table and I saw this light. No kidding. It sounds crazy. And 10 years later, I had [[Grace Kelly]] handing me an [[Academy Award]].}}

===Stage===
He studied acting and graduated, auditioned, and was accepted as an intern to the [[Barter Theatre]] in [[Abingdon, Virginia]]. It had been named for the director's allowing audiences to barter produce for admission during the cash-lean years of the [[Great Depression]]. In 1947, Borgnine landed his first stage role in ''[[State of the Union (play)|State of the Union]]''. Although it was a short role, he won over the audience. His next role was as the Gentleman Caller in [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]''.

In 1949, Borgnine went to New York, where he had his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in the role of a nurse in the play ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]''. More roles on stage led him to being cast for decades as a [[character actor]].

===Films===
[[File:Ernest Borgnine-Betsy Blair in Marty trailer.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Borgnine and [[Betsy Blair]] in ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' trailer in 1955]]
An appearance as the villain on TV's ''[[Captain Video]]'' led to Borgnine's casting in the motion picture ''[[The Whistle at Eaton Falls]]'' (1951) for Columbia Pictures.<ref>Kisselhoff, Jeff; THE BOX: An Oral History of Television, 1929-1961; Viking Penguin, 1995</ref>  That year, Borgnine moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where he eventually received his big break in Columbia's ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953), playing the sadistic Sergeant "Fatso" Judson, who beats a stockade prisoner in his charge, Angelo Maggio (played by [[Frank Sinatra]]). Borgnine built a reputation as a dependable character actor and played villains in early films, including movies like ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'' and ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]''.

In 1955, the actor starred as a warmhearted butcher in ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'', the film version of [[Marty (teleplay)|the television play of the same name]]. He gained an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] over Frank Sinatra, [[James Dean]] (who had died by the time of the ceremony), and former Best Actor winners [[Spencer Tracy]] and [[James Cagney]].

Borgnine's film career flourished for the next three decades, including roles in ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix (1965 film)|The Flight of the Phoenix]]'' (1965), ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967),  ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]'' (1968), ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1972), ''[[Emperor of the North]]'' (1973), ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' (1978), ''[[The Black Hole]]'' (1979), ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1979) and ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981).

One of his most famous roles was that of Dutch, a member of ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' in the 1969 Western classic from director [[Sam Peckinpah]]. Of his role in ''The Wild Bunch'', Borgnine later said,
<blockquote>I did [think it was a moral film]. Because to me, every picture should have some kind of a moral to it. I feel that when we used to watch old pictures, as we still do I'm sure, the bad guys always got it in the end and the good guys always won out. Today it's a little different. Today it seems that the bad guys are getting the good end of it. There was always a moral in our story.<ref name="bfi.org.uk"/></blockquote>

===Television===
Borgnine made his TV debut as a character actor in ''[[Captain Video and His Video Rangers]]'', beginning in 1951. These two episodes led to countless other television roles that Borgnine would gain in ''[[Goodyear Television Playhouse]]'', ''[[The Ford Television Theatre]]'', ''[[Fireside Theatre]]'', ''[[Frontier Justice (TV series)|Frontier Justice]]'', ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'', ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'', ''[[Run for Your Life (TV series)|Run for Your Life]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' (a two-part episode entitled "The Lord is My Shepherd"), ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'', ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'', ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', and the final episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', the first episode of ''[[Wagon Train]]'', and many others.

In 2009, at the age of 92, Borgnine earned an Emmy nomination for his performances in the final two episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.

====''[[McHale's Navy]]''====
[[File:Ernest Borgnine McHale McHale's Navy 1963.JPG|thumb|180px|right|Borgnine as Commander McHale in ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' in 1963]]
In 1962, Borgnine joined the ranks of other [[sitcom]] stars such as [[John Forsythe]], [[Andy Griffith]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Alan Young]], [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]], [[Fred MacMurray]], and [[Buddy Ebsen]]. That same year he signed a contract with [[Universal Studios]] for the lead role as the gruff but lovable skipper [[Lieutenant Commander]] Quinton McHale in what began as a serious one-hour 1962 episode called ''[[Seven Against the Sea]]'' for ''Alcoa Premiere'', and later reworked to a comedy called ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', a World War II sitcom. The insubordinate crew of PT-73 helped the show become an overnight success during its first season, landing in the Top 30 in 1963.

Just like the McHale character, Borgnine was a longtime navy man in real life. He thrived on the adulation from fans for their favorite navy man, and in 1963 received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. At the end of the fourth season, in 1966 low ratings and repetitive storylines brought ''McHale's Navy'' to an end. Comedian [[Tim Conway]] said about the sitcom: "You know, we were all guys, it was about the war, and about men, so, there weren't many women working on the show, so we can spit, talk, swear, and everything—smoke? Gosh. So, it was male oriented." Conway once referred to Borgnine making new friends off of the Universal set, "It was the beginning of the trams, going through Universal. Ernie was probably one of the few people at Universal, who would stop the trams and say, 'Hello, how are you?' He would talk to everybody at the tram." While the show ''McHale's Navy'' was going strong, Tim had also said of Borgnine's short-lived marriage to [[Ethel Merman]], "Ernie is volatile. I mean, there's no question about that; and Ethel was a very strong lady. So, you put 2 bombs in a room, something is going to explode, and I guess it probably did." The last thing he said about the ''McHale's Navy'' cancellation was, "We had gone from the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] to [[Italy]], and then, once in a while, we got to [[New York]] or something. The storylines were beginning to duplicate themselves. So, they actually said, 'Maybe, they had its run!'". Conway kept in touch with Borgnine, for more than 40 years, while living not too far from one another. In 1999, the duo reunited to guest-voice in several episodes of the popular 2000s animated comedy, ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. Katy Jurado's death in 2002 drew Borgnine & Conway much closer, as Tim had heard so much of the actress's death. He said he heard his resisting friend once referred to one of his ex-wives, "Beautiful, but a tiger."{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

====''Airwolf''====
Borgnine returned to a new contract with [[Universal Studios]] in 1983, for a co-starring role opposite [[Jan-Michael Vincent]], on ''[[Airwolf]]''. After he was approached by producer [[Donald P. Bellisario]], who had been impressed by Borgnine's guest role as a wrestler in a 1982 episode of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', he immediately agreed. He played Dominic Santini, a helicopter pilot, in the series, which became an immediate hit. Borgnine's strong performances belied his exhaustion due to the grueling production schedule, and the challenges of working with his younger, troubled series lead. The show was cancelled by [[CBS]] in 1986

====''The Single Guy''====
He auditioned a third time for a co-starring role opposite [[Jonathan Silverman]] in ''[[The Single Guy]]'' as doorman Manny Cordoba, which lasted two seasons. According to Silverman, Borgnine came to work with more energy and passion than all other stars combined. He was the first person to arrive on the set every day and the last to leave.

====''Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders''====
In 1996, Borgnine starred in the televised fantasy/thriller film ''[[Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders]]'' (partially adapted from the 1984 horror film ''[[The Devil's Gift]]''). As narrator and storyteller, Borgnine recounts a string of related supernatural tales, his modern-day fables notably centering around an enchanted and malicious [[cymbal-banging monkey toy]] stolen from the wizard [[Merlin]]. The film was later featured in the parodical television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', and has since gained a prominent cult following.<ref name="mstk.info">{{cite web|url=http://www.mst3kinfo.com/?p=5768|title=Episode guide: 1003 – Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders|publisher=Satellite News|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref>

===Other activities===
Also in 1996, Borgnine toured the United States on a bus to meet his fans and see the country. The trip was the subject of a 1997 documentary, ''Ernest Borgnine on the Bus''. He also served one year as the Chairman of the National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans, visiting patients in many [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] medical centers.

===Work after 1999===
Starting in 1999, Borgnine provided his voice talent to the [[animated sitcom]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' as the elderly superhero [[Mermaid Man]] (where he was paired up with his ''[[McHale's Navy]]'' co-star [[Tim Conway]] as the voice of Mermaid Man's sidekick [[Barnacle Boy]]). He expressed affection for this role, in no small part for its popularity among children. After his death Nickelodeon re-aired all of the episodes in which Mermaid Man appeared in memoriam. Borgnine also appeared as himself in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood]]", in addition to a number of television commercials. In 2000, he was the executive producer of ''[[Hoover (film)|Hoover]]'', in which he was the only credited actor.

In 2007, Borgnine starred in the [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] original film ''[[A Grandpa for Christmas]]''. He played a man who, after his estranged daughter ends up in the hospital after being in a car accident, discovers that he has a granddaughter he never knew about. She is taken into his care, and they soon become great friends. Borgnine received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for Television for his performance. At 90, he was the oldest Golden Globe nominee ever.

Borgnine's autobiography ''Ernie'' was published by [[Citadel Press]] in July 2008. ''Ernie'' is a loose, conversational recollection of highlights from his acting career and notable events from his personal life.

On April 2, 2009, he appeared in the last episode of the long-running medical series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''. His role was that of a husband whose long marriage ended with his wife's death. In his final scene, his character is in a hospital bed lying beside his just-deceased wife. His performance garnered an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series, his third nomination and his first in 29 years (since being nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Special in 1980 for ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1979 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'').

In 2009, at age 92, he starred as Frank, the main character of ''[[Another Harvest Moon]]'', directed by Greg Swartz and also starring [[Piper Laurie]] and [[Anne Meara]]. On October 2, 2010, Borgnine appeared as himself in a sketch on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. On October 15, 2010, he appeared in ''[[Red (2010 film)|Red]]'', which was filmed earlier that year. In late 2011, Borgnine completed what would be his last film, playing Rex Page in ''The Man Who Shook The Hand of Vicente Fernandez''.

==Quotes==
{{Copy section to Wikiquote}}
* Ernest: "[[Spencer Tracy]] was the first actor I've seen who could just look down into the dirt and command a scene. He played a set-up with [[Robert Ryan]] that way. He's looking down at the road and then he looks at Ryan at just the precise, right minute. I tell you, Rob could've stood on his head and zipped open his fly and the scene would've still been Mr. Tracy's."
* Ernest: "The trick is not to become somebody else. You become somebody else when you're in front of a camera or when you're on stage. There are some people who carry it all the time. That, to me, is not acting. What you've gotta do is find out what the writer wrote about and put it into your mind. This is acting. Not going out and researching what the writer has already written. This is crazy!"
* Ernest: "Everything I do has a moral to it. Yes, I've been in films that have had shootings. I made ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), which was the beginning of the splattering of blood and everything else. But there was a moral behind it. The moral was that, by golly, bad guys got it. That was it. Yeah."
* Ernest: "Ever since they opened the floodgates with [[Clark Gable]] saying, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,' somebody's ears pricked up and said, 'Oh boy, here we go!'. Writers used to make such wonderful pictures without all that swearing, all that cursing. And now it seems that you can't say three words without cursing. And I don't think that's right."
* Ernest on [[drugs]]: "No, I've never done anything. At least, not to my knowledge. I once took a bunch of [[goofballs]] by accident. They looked like candy. They were in a little bowl at a party. I grabbed a handful and went to town. That was some New Year's Eve. I didn't have a coherent thought till February."
* Ernest on his marriage to [[Ethel Merman]]: "Biggest mistake of my life. I thought I was marrying [[Rosemary Clooney]]."
* Ernest on his $5,000 salary for playing the eponymous lead in ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' (1955), which won him a Best Actor Oscar: "...I would have done it for nothing."
* Ernest on Women's Rights: "They tried it the wrong way. You can't expect anyone to take you seriously if you burn your undies and tell me I'm a pig. That's why it failed. Too many ugly broads telling me that they don't want to sleep with me. Who wanted you anyway?"
* Ernest: "I'm 81 years old and I like to speak my mind. As a legacy, on the day I die, I'd like to have a newspaper publish all the things that I find wrong in the United States today. And my first would be to get rid of the politicians."<ref name="fantle"/>
