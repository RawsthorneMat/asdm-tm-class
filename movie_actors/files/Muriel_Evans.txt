'''Muriel Evans''' (July 20, 1910 &ndash; October 26, 2000) was an American film actress.  She is best known for her many appearances in popular [[Western (genre)|westerns]] of the 1930s for which she won a [[Golden Boot Awards|Golden Boot Award]].

==Early life and career==
'''Muriel Adele Evanson''' was born in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] to Norwegian immigrant parents. Her father died when she was only two months old, forcing her mother to move to [[California]] to find work, where Evans' mother took a job as a maid at First National Studios. She spent her afternoons on film sets and was soon noticed by a studio executive. The executive introduced her to the director [[Robert Z. Leonard]], who gave her a small role opposite [[Corinne Griffith]] in the 1926 film, ''[[Madamoiselle Modiste (film)|Mademoiselle Modiste]]''. She continued attending classes at [[Hollywood High School]] and landing bit parts in stock theater productions and silent films.<ref name=muriel>{{cite news|last=Mutti-Mews|first=Howard|title=Obituary: Muriel Evans|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=2000-11-08|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20001108/ai_n14344182|accessdate=2007-08-18}} {{Dead link|date=August 2009}}</ref>

In 1929, Evans co-starred in the [[Silent film|silent]], comedic short films, ''Good Night Nurse'' and ''Joyland'', starring [[Lupino Lane]]. Shortly after completing ''Joyland'', Evans put her acting career on hold to finish school. In July 1929, Evans announced her engagement to Michael J. P. Cudahy, the grandson of [[Michael Cudahy (industrialist)|Michael Cudahy]], one of the founders of the [[Cudahy Packing Company]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YycvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=m9QFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2938,3601835&dq=michael+cudahy+muriel+evans&hl=en|title=WEALTHY YOUTH PLANS TO WED MURIEL EVANS|date=1929-07-03|work=The Miami News|pages=J–4|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref> They were married on July 7, 1929 in [[Riverside, California]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CUDAHY MARRIES ACTRESS |date=1929-07-29|work=The Los Angeles Times|page=A6|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref> Evans and Cudahy traveled the world and settled in [[Paris]].

[[File:Evans and Chase - Nature in the Wrong.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Muriel Evans with [[Charley Chase]] in the 1933 film ''Nature in the Wrong'']]
In 1932, Evans starred in six films, most notably, ''Young Ironsides'' with [[Charley Chase]] and ''[[Pack Up Your Troubles]]'' with [[Laurel and Hardy]]. She would go on to star in eight more shorts with Chase before his death in 1940.

Evans' success was due in large part to her pleasant speaking voice. She made a smooth transition from [[silent pictures]] to [[talkies]], and throughout the 1930s, Evans continued to work steadily. She appeared in [[Frank Capra|Frank Capra's]] ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'', ''[[Manhattan Melodrama]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[William Powell]], and ''[[The Prizefighter and the Lady]]'' with [[Myrna Loy]]. By the mid-1930s, Evans also began co-starring in popular westerns alongside [[Tom Mix]], [[John Wayne]] and [[Tex Ritter]]. She also starred in three ''[[Hopalong Cassidy]]'' films opposite [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]], and did seven westerns with [[Buck Jones]].<ref>[http://b-westerns.com/ladies46.htm The Heroines: Muriel Evans]</ref>

==Later years==
[[File:Evans & Ellison 1936.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Muriel Evans with [[James Ellison (actor)|James Ellison]] in the 1936 film ''Three on the Trail'']]
In 1936, Evans married a [[theatrical agent]], Marshall R. Worchester. By age 30, she retired from acting. One of her last film appearances came in 1946, in the [[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith]] short, ''Studio Visit''. Soon after retiring, Evans and her husband settled in [[Washington, D.C.]] Over the next decade, she starred in four [[radio shows]] and in the television show ''Hollywood Reporter''. In 1951, the couple moved back to Hollywood, although Evans never resumed her acting career. Eventually, the couple bought property in [[Tarzana, California]], where Evans dabbled in real estate.<ref name=muriel />

After the death of her husband in 1971, Evans began work as a volunteer nurse at the [[Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills]] not far from her home. After a stroke in 1994, she became a resident within the complex and often dined with fellow actors with whom she had once worked, including [[Anita Garvin]]. In 1999, Evans made her last film appearance in a 2000 documentary, ''I Used to Be in Pictures'', in which she was one of many former actors who recalled their experiences in the film work.<ref name=muriel />

==Death==
On October 26, 2000, Muriel Evans died of [[colon cancer]] at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California. She was 90 years old.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zHpaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1x4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6984,4815957&dq=muriel+evans+cancer&hl=en|title=Muriel Evans, film actress, died at 90|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|date=2000-10-30|work=Star-News|pages=4–B|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>
