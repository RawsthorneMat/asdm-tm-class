'''John 'Dusty' King''' (born '''Miller McLeod Everson''', July 11, 1909 â€“ November 11, 1987 was a singer and film actor renowned for his [[Western (genre)|Western]]s particularly the [[Range Busters]] series.

==Biography==
Everson was born in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. A graduate of the [[University of Cincinnati]], Everson travelled the country working a variety of jobs, such as chauffeuring motorcars from Detroit to Cincinnati, lumberjacking in New Mexico, and working as a ranch hand in Arizona.<ref name="Rainey">Rainey, Buck ''Serial Film Stars: A Biographical Dictionary 1912-1956'' 2005 McFarland, p.714</ref>

Everson found himself a radio announcing job in Covington, Kentucky then returned to Cincinnati where he announced, hosted, and sang.  Hearing him on the radio, bandleader [[Ben Bernie]] hired him as a singer with Everson changing his name to John King.  Noting his good looks and popularity, Bernie recommended him to Hollywood with [[Zeppo Marx]] also agreeing with Bernie.<ref name="Rainey" />

==Hollywood==
King was contracted to [[Universal Pictures]] making several films and playing the lead in the serial ''[[Ace Drummond]]''.  He made appearances in films for other studios before being hired by [[Monogram Pictures]] to play the lead in a [[Cinecolor]] Western, ''[[The Gentleman from Arizona]]'' in 1939.  The following year King would play "Dusty" in The Range Busters series of Westerns.

The Range Busters were Monogram's version of [[Republic Pictures]]' [[The Three Mesquiteers]].  King played the [[singing cowboy]] alongside of [[Ray "Crash" Corrigan]] who was later replaced by [[David Sharpe (actor)|David Sharpe]] and [[comedy relief]] [[Max Terhune]] with his dummy Elmer for a total of 18 films in the series.

In ''[[Haunted Ranch]]'' (1943), Sharpe leaves the trio to enlist in the US Army in the [[Spanish-American War]].  Not only did Sharpe actually enlist in the [[US Army Air Forces]] but King himself was drafted in the USAAF serving in [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] in Arizona.

After discharge there were no film offers, so King returned to radio, later buying a station.  He later left the radio industry to run a waffle shop in [[La Jolla]], California.
