'''Roger Lance Mobley''' (born January 16, 1949 in [[Evansville, Indiana]]) was a busy child actor in the 1950s and 1960s, making over 110 television appearances and co-starring in nine feature films in his nine-year career,<ref>http://www.brokenwheelranch.com</ref> before becoming a member of the [[Green Berets]] (46th Special Forces Co.) during the Vietnam War. He was later an officer with the Police Department in Beaumont, Texas.<ref>[http://www.brokenwheelranch.com/rogersbiography.htm]</ref>

After nine years and appearances in 118 television programs or feature films, Mobley's career was interrupted at the age of eighteen by military service. Mobley was quoted as having said, "Uncle Walt [Disney] had plans for me, but so did Uncle Sam, and Uncle Sam won." <ref>Growing up on the set, Tom & Jim Goldrup,McFarland & Co.,Inc., Jefferson, NC, 2002 page 212</ref>
