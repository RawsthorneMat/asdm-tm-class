==Career==

===1990–1998===
Swank made her film debut, ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' in a small role, after which she acted in the direct-to-video drama ''Quiet Days in Hollywood'', where she co-starred with her future husband at the time [[Chad Lowe]].<ref name="Yahoo"/> Her first leading film role was in the fourth installment of the ''Karate Kid'' series, ''[[The Next Karate Kid]]'' (1994), which utilized her gymnastics background and paired her with [[Pat Morita]].

In September 1997, Swank played single mother Carly Reynolds in ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' and was initially promised it would be a two-year role, but saw her character written out after 16 episodes in January 1998.<ref name=actors/> Swank later stated that she was devastated at being cut from the show, thinking, "If I'm not good enough for ''90210'', I'm not good enough for anything."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/hilary-reaping-rewards/2007/04/22/1177180466303.html | work=Sydney Morning Herald | title=Hilary Swank reaping rewards | date=April 23, 2007}}</ref>

===1999–2006===
