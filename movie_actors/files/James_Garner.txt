'''James Garner''' (born '''James Scott Bumgarner'''; April 7, 1928 – July 19, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] actor, voice artist, singer, producer, and comedian.

Garner came to hate his stepmother, Wilma, who beat all three boys, especially James. When he was 14, Garner had enough and after a heated battle, she left the family, never to return. Jack Garner later commented, "She was a damn no-good woman".<ref name=Strait>Strait, Raymond . ''James Garner''. New York, New York: St. Martin's Press. 1985.

This incident ended the marriage.<ref>Grobel, Lawrence. ''The Art of the Interview''. New York: Three Rivers Press. 2004, p. 161. ISBN 1-4000-5071-5</ref>

Shortly after his marriage broke up, Weldon Bumgarner moved to [[Los Angeles]], though his sons stayed in Norman. After working at several jobs he disliked, Garner joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] at age 16 near the end of [[World War II]]. He liked the work and his shipmates, but he suffered from chronic [[seasickness]].<ref name="Indie2" />

After the war, Garner joined his father in Los Angeles and enrolled at [[Hollywood High School]], where he was voted the most popular student. A high school gym teacher recommended him for a job [[Model (people)|modeling]] [[Jantzen]] bathing suits.<ref name=CunneffT-People>Cunneff, Tom.

In a 1976 ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' magazine interview, he admitted, "I was a terrible student and I never actually graduated from high school, but I got my diploma in the Army."<ref name="GoodHousekeeping-Mar76" />

He enlisted in the [[California Army National Guard|National Guard]], serving his first seven months in California. He then went to Korea for 14 months, as a rifleman in the [[5th Infantry Regiment (United States)#Korean War|5th Regimental Combat Team]] during the [[Korean War]]. He was wounded twice, first in the face and hand by [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] fire from a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] round, and the second time in the buttocks from [[friendly fire]] from U.S. fighter jets as he dove headfirst into a foxhole. Garner received the [[Purple Heart#Notable recipients|Purple Heart]] in Korea for the first injury.

==Acting career==

===Earliest roles===
In 1954, a friend, Paul Gregory, whom Garner had met while attending Hollywood High School, persuaded Garner to take a nonspeaking role in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial]]'', where he was able to study actor [[Henry Fonda]] night after night.<ref name="Indie2" />  During the week of Garner's death, [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] broadcast most of his movies, introduced by [[Robert Osborne]], who said that Fonda's gentle, sincere persona rubbed off on Garner, greatly to Garner's benefit.

Garner subsequently moved to [[television commercial]]s<ref name="Scotsman">[http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-james-garner-actor-1-3482660 Obituary: James Garner, actor – ''The Scotsman''<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and eventually to television roles. In 1955, Garner was considered for the lead role in the first Warner Brothers Western series, ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'', but that role went to [[Clint Walker]] because the casting director could not reach Garner in time (according to Garner's autobiography), and Garner wound up playing an Army officer in the pilot, instead. His first film appearances were in ''[[The Girl He Left Behind]]'' and ''[[Toward the Unknown]]'' in 1956.

In 1957, he had a supporting role in the TV anthology series episode on ''[[Conflict (TV series)|Conflict]]'' entitled "[[Man from 1997]]" playing [[Gloria Talbott]]'s (as Maureen) brother "Red"; the show stars [[Jacques Sernas]] as Johnny Vlakos and [[Charlie Ruggles]] as elderly Mr. Boyne, a librarian from 1997, and involved a 1997 Almanac that was mistakenly left in the past by Boyne and found by Johnny in a bookstore.<ref>{{YouTube|FBlfxbH1w3Y|title=''The Man From 1997'' (TV Pilot)}}</ref>  The show's producer, [[Roy Huggins]], noted in his [[Archive of American Television]] interview that he subsequently cast Garner as the lead in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' because of Garner's comedic facial expressions while playing scenes in ''Man from 1997'' that were not originally written to be comical.

He changed his last name from Bumgarner to Garner after the studio had credited him as "James Garner" without permission. He then legally changed it upon the birth of his first child, when he decided she had too many names.<ref name=GoogleVideo/>

===''Maverick''===

Garner was closely advised by financial adviser [[Irving Leonard (financial adviser)|Irving Leonard]], who also advised [[Clint Eastwood]] in the late 1950s and 1960s.<ref name="Broadcasting">{{cite book|title=Broadcasting|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tjgoAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=January 13, 2011|year=1965|publisher=Cahners Pub.

Only Garner and series creator [[Roy Huggins]] thought ''Maverick'' could compete with ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]''. The show almost immediately made Garner a household name.<ref name="Indie2" /> Various actors had recurring roles as Maverick foils, including [[Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.]] as "Dandy Jim Buckley", [[Richard Long (actor)|Richard Long]] as "Gentleman Jack Darby", [[Leo Gordon]] as "Big Mike McComb", and [[Diane Brewster]] as "Samantha Crawford" (Huggins' mother's maiden name).

[[File:James Garner Bret Maverick Jack Kelly Bart Maverick.JPG|thumb|left|Garner as Bret Maverick and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] as Bart Maverick]]
Garner was the lone star of ''Maverick'' for the first seven episodes, but production demands forced the studio, [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], to create a Maverick brother, [[Maverick (TV series)#Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick|Bart]], played by [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]]. This allowed two production units to film different story lines and episodes simultaneously. The series also featured popular cross-over [[List of Maverick episodes|episodes]] featuring both Maverick brothers, including the famous "[[Shady Deal at Sunny Acres]]", upon which the first half of the 1973 movie ''[[The Sting]]'' appears to be based, according to Roy Huggins' Archive of American Television interview. Garner and Clint Eastwood staged an epic fistfight in an episode entitled "[[Duel at Sundown (Maverick)|Duel at Sundown]]", in which Eastwood plays a vicious gunslinger. Critics were positive about Garner and Jack Kelly's chemistry, but Garner quit the series after the third season because of a dispute with Warner Brothers.<ref name="Indie2" />

Garner did make one fourth-season ''Maverick'' appearance, in an episode filmed in third season but held back.  The studio attempted to replace Garner's character with a Maverick cousin who had lived in Britain long enough to pick up an English accent, played by [[Roger Moore]], but Moore quit the series after filming only [[List of Maverick episodes#Fourth season (1960-1961)|14 episodes]] as [[Maverick (TV series)#Roger Moore as Beau Maverick|Beau Maverick]]. Warner Brothers also dressed [[Robert Colbert]], a Garner look-alike, in Bret Maverick's outfit and called the character Brent, but [[Maverick (TV series)#Robert Colbert as Brent Maverick|Brent Maverick]] did not have a chance to catch on with viewers since Colbert made only two episodes toward the end of the season.  This left the rest of the series run to Kelly, alternating with reruns of [[List of Maverick episodes|episodes with Garner]].  Garner still received billing in these newly produced Kelly episodes, aired in the 1961-62 season, though he did not appear in them and had left the series two years previously, but the studio reversed the billing at the beginning of each show and in advertisements during the fifth season, billing Kelly above Garner.

When [[Charlton Heston]] turned down the lead role in ''[[Darby's Rangers (1958 film)|Darby's Rangers]]'' before Garner's departure from ''Maverick'', Garner was selected and performed well in the role. As a result of Garner's performance in ''Darby's Rangers'', coupled with his ''Maverick'' popularity, Warner Brothers subsequently gave him lead roles in other films, such as ''[[Up Periscope]]'' and ''[[Cash McCall]]''.

===1960s: Film career peak===
[[File:Bob Hope James Garner 1961.JPG|thumb|180px|With [[Bob Hope]] in a 1961 Hope TV special]]
After his acrimonious departure from Warner Bros., in the 1960s he starred in such films as ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'' (1962) with [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]], ''[[Boys' Night Out (film)|Boys' Night Out]]'' (1962) with [[Kim Novak]] and [[Tony Randall]], ''[[The Thrill of It All]]'' (1963) with [[Doris Day]], ''[[Move Over, Darling]]'' (a 1963 [[remake]] of ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' also starring Doris Day in which Garner played [[Cary Grant]]'s role), ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963) with [[Steve McQueen]], ''[[The Americanization of Emily]]'' (1964) with [[Julie Andrews]], ''[[The Art of Love (1965 film)|The Art of Love]]'' (1965) with [[Dick Van Dyke]], ''[[Duel at Diablo]]'' (1966) with [[Sidney Poitier]], and as [[Wyatt Earp]] in ''[[Hour of the Gun]]'' (1967) with [[Jason Robards, Jr.]] as [[Doc Holliday]], along with nine other theatrical releases during the decade.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In the smash hit war film ''The Great Escape'', Garner played the second lead for the only time during the decade, supporting fellow ex-TV series cowboy [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] among a cast of British and American screen veterans including [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Donald Pleasence]], [[David McCallum]], [[James Coburn]], and [[Charles Bronson]] in a film depicting a mass escape from a German [[prisoner of war]] camp based on a [[The Great Escape (book)|true story]]. The film was released in the same month as ''[[The Thrill Of It All]]'', giving Garner two films at the box office at the same time.

''The Americanization of Emily'', a literate [[anti-war film|antiwar]] [[D-Day]] comedy, featured a [[screenplay]] written by [[Paddy Chayefsky]] and has remained Garner's favorite of all his work.<ref>[http://www.filmmonthly.com/Profiles/Articles/JGarner/JGarner.html "Lowly Brother Amidst The Sisterhood"] ''Film Monthly'' (June 3, 2002) Retrieved on June 2, 2008</ref><ref name=MurrayR-SAG-JG-LAA>Murray, Rebecca.

===1970s===
In 1971, Garner returned to television in an offbeat series, ''[[Nichols (TV series)|Nichols]]''. The motorcycle-riding antihero character was killed in what became the final episode of the single-season series. Garner was recast as the character's more normal twin brother, in the hopes of creating a more popular series with few cast changes.<ref name="USATodayBio">{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/07/20/actor-james-garner-appreciation-robert-bianco/12909399/ | title=Appreciation: James Garner, reluctant hero | work=USA Today | accessdate=July 20, 2014}}</ref> According to Garner's 1999 videotaped Archive of American Television interview, not only did the network change the name of the series to ''James Garner as Nichols'', but Garner had Nichols killed in the last episode so that a sequel could never be made.<ref name="AATInterview">{{cite interview |last=Garner |first=James |subjectlink= James Garner |interviewer= Karen Herman, Morrie Gelman |title=Interview with James Garner |url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/james-garner |callsign= |city=Los Angeles, California |date=March 17, 1999 |program=[[Archive of American Television]] |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref>

The year 1971 also hadhim star in the comedies ''[[Support Your Local Gunfighter!]]'' (with many similarities to ''Support Your Local Sheriff!''), and the frontier comedy ''[[Skin Game]]'', featuring [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] and Garner as con men pretending to be a slave and his owner during the pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era.  The following year, Garner played a modern sheriff investigating a murder in the suspense drama ''[[They Only Kill Their Masters]]'' with [[Katharine Ross|Katherine Ross]]. He appeared in two movies co-starring [[Vera Miles]] as his [[leading lady]], ''[[One Little Indian (film)|One Little Indian]]'' (1973) featuring [[Jodie Foster]] in an early minor role and ''[[The Castaway Cowboy]]'' (1974) with [[Robert Culp]], before returning to television with a new detective series.

===''The Rockford Files''===
[[File:James Garner James Whitmore Jr. Rockford Files 1977.JPG|thumb|right|With [[James Whitmore, Jr.]] in ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' (1977)]]
In the 1970s, Roy Huggins had an idea to remake ''Maverick,'' but this time as a modern-day [[private detective]]. Huggins teamed with co-creator [[Stephen J. Cannell]], and the pair tapped Garner to attempt to rekindle the success of ''Maverick,'' eventually recycling many of the plots from the original series. Starting with the 1974 season, Garner appeared as [[private investigator]] Jim Rockford in ''[[The Rockford Files]].'' He appeared for six seasons, for which he received an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Emmy Award for Best Actor]]<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/james-garner James Garner Emmy Nominated]</ref> in 1977. Veteran character actor [[Noah Beery, Jr.]] ([[Noah Beery, Sr.]]'s son and [[Wallace Beery]]'s nephew) played Rockford's father, Joseph "Rocky" Rockford. [[Gretchen Corbett]] portrayed Rockford's lawyer and sometime lover, Beth Davenport, until she left the series over a salary dispute with the studio. Garner also invited another familiar actor, [[Joe Santos]], to play Rockford's friend in the [[Los Angeles Police Department]], Detective Dennis Becker. Rounding out the cast was a character actor and friend of Garner's who had previously co-starred with him on ''Nichols,'' [[Stuart Margolin]], playing Jim's ex-cell mate and treacherous "friend" Angel Martin. In the first episode of season six, "Paradise Cove", [[Mariette Hartley]] guest-starred as Court Auditor Althea Morgan.

[[File:James Garner Rockford Files 1974.JPG|left|thumb|"Tall Woman in Red Wagon" episode (1974)]]
Garner had previously appeared with ''Rockford Files'' co-star Hartley in a series of [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] Camera commercials. After six seasons, ''The Rockford Files'' was cancelled in 1980. Although low ratings were primarily to blame, the physical toll on Garner was also an issue.<ref name=A&E-Biography>"James Garner: Hollywood Maverick."

Margolin said of his longtime colleague that despite Garner's health problems in the later years of ''The Rockford Files,'' he would often work long shifts, unusual for a starring actor, staying to do off-camera lines with other actors, doing his own stunts despite his knee problems.<ref name=A&E-Biography/> When Garner later made ''The Rockford Files'' television movies, he said that 22 people (with the exception of series co-star Beery, who died late in 1994) came out of retirement to participate.<ref name=A&E-Biography/>

In July 1983, Garner filed suit against [[Universal Studios]] for [[United States dollar|US$]]16.5 million in connection with his ongoing dispute from ''The Rockford Files.'' The suit charged Universal with "breach of contract; failure to deal in good faith and fairly; and fraud and deceit." Garner alleged that Universal was "[[Hollywood accounting|creatively accounting]]", two words that are now part of the Hollywood lexicon.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/james-garner-a-lawyer-reflects-720549 |title=James Garner: A Lawyer Reflects on the Actor's Legal Legacy |date=July 23, 2014 |author=Neville Johnson |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> The suit was eventually settled out of court in 1989.

"The industry is like it always has been. It's a bunch of greedy people," he stated in 1990.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/20/showbiz/james-garner-death/ |title=Famed actor James Garner dies at 86 |author=Todd Leopold |date=July 21, 2014 |publisher= [[CNN]] }}</ref> Garner sued Universal again in 1998 for $2.2 million over syndication royalties. In this suit, he charged the studio with "deceiving him and suppressing information about syndication." He was supposed to receive $25,000 per episode that ran in syndication, but Universal charged him "distribution fees". He also felt that the studio did not release the show to the highest bidder for the episode reruns.<ref name=Variety-1998-09-14/>

===''The New Maverick''===
Garner and Jack Kelly reappeared as Bret and Bart Maverick in a 1978 made-for-TV movie entitled ''[[The New Maverick]]'', which served as the pilot for a failed series, ''[[Young Maverick]]'', starring [[Charles Frank]] as a younger cousin named Ben Maverick.  The series itself, which only featured Garner for a few moments at the beginning of the first show, was canceled so rapidly, some of the episodes filmed were never broadcast.

===1980s===
After the abrupt disappearance of ''Young Maverick'' two seasons earlier, an attempt to make a "Maverick" series without Garner, he returned to his earlier TV role in 1981 in the revival series ''[[Bret Maverick]]'', but NBC unexpectedly canceled the show after only one season despite reasonably good ratings. Critics noted that most of the scripts did not measure up to the first series. Jack Kelly ([[Maverick (TV series)#Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick|Bart Maverick]]) was slated to become a series regular had the show been picked up for another season, and he appeared in the last scene of the final episode in a surprise guest appearance.

During the 1980s, Garner played dramatic roles in a number of TV movies, including ''[[Heartsounds]]'' (with [[Mary Tyler Moore]]), ''[[Promise (film)|Promise]]'' (with [[Piper Laurie]]), and ''[[My Name Is Bill W.]]''  In 1984, he played the lead in [[Joseph Wambaugh]]'s ''[[The Glitter Dome (film)|The Glitter Dome]]'' for [[HBO Pictures]], which was being directed by his ''Rockford Files'' co-star [[Stuart Margolin]].  The film generated a mild controversy for a bondage sequence featuring Garner and co-star [[Margot Kidder]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/19963/The-Glitter-Dome/overview |title=The Glitter Dome| work=The New York Times}}</ref>

He was nominated for his first and only [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Best Actor in a Leading Role]] in the movie ''[[Murphy's Romance]]'' opposite [[Sally Field]]. Field, and director [[Martin Ritt]], had to fight the studio, [[Columbia Pictures]], to have Garner cast, since he was regarded as a TV actor by then (despite having co-starred in the box office hit ''[[Victor Victoria]]'' opposite [[Julie Andrews]] two years earlier). Columbia did not want to make the picture at all, because it had no "sex or violence" in it. But because of the success of ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), with the same star (Field), director, and screenplay writing team (Harriet Frank Jr. and Irving Ravetch), and with Field's new production company (Fogwood Films) producing, Columbia agreed. Columbia wanted [[Marlon Brando]] to play the part of Murphy, so Field and Ritt had to insist on Garner.<ref>Cameron, Julia. – "Garner Fits Romantic Role, Not Hollywood Pigeonhole."

Garner played [[Wyatt Earp]] in two very different movies shot 21 years apart, ''[[Hour of the Gun]]'' in 1967 and ''[[Sunset (film)|Sunset]]'' in 1988. The first film was a realistic depiction of the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|O.K. Corral shootout]] and its aftermath, while the second centered around a fictional adventure shared by Earp and silent movie cowboy star [[Tom Mix]].  The film featured [[Bruce Willis]] as Mix in only his second movie role. Although Willis was billed over Garner, the film actually gave more screen time and emphasis to Earp.

For the second half of the 1980s, Garner appeared in several of the North American market [[Mazda]] television commercials as an on-screen spokesman.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-10/business/fi-2280_1_james-garner |title=Mazda Drops Garner to Try New Route in Commercials |last=Horovitz |first=Bruce |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 10, 1989 |accessdate=July 22, 2014}} "four-year stint as a spokesman for Mazda... contract expires in March" (i.e. March 1985–89)</ref>

===1990s===
In 1991, Garner starred in ''[[Man of the People (TV series)|Man of the People]]'', a television series about a con man chosen to fill an empty seat on a city council, with [[Kate Mulgrew]] and [[Corinne Bohrer]].<ref>{{cite web|author=TV Guide |url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/man-of-the-people/cast/202891 |title=Man of the People Cast and Details|publisher=TV Guide |accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref> Despite reasonably fair ratings, the show was canceled after only 10 episodes. In 1993, Garner played the lead in another well-received TV-movie, ''[[Barbarians_at_the_Gate_(film)|Barbarians at the Gate]]'', and went on to reprise his role as Jim Rockford in eight ''The Rockford Files'' made-for-TV movies beginning the following year.<ref>{{cite book |author=Strait, Raymond |year=1985 |title=James Garner |publisher=New York: St. Martin's |page=295 |isbn=978-0-312-43967-5 }}</ref>  Practically everyone in the original cast of recurring characters returned for the new episodes except Noah Beery, Jr., who had died in the interim.

In 1994, Garner played Marshal Zane Cooper in a movie version of ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'', with [[Mel Gibson]] as [[Maverick (TV series)#1994 film adaptation|Bret Maverick]] (in the end it is revealed that Garner's character is the father of Gibson's Maverick) and [[Jodie Foster]] as a gambling lass with a fake Southern accent.<ref>{{cite news|title= SUMMER SNEAKS '94 : Was, Is and Always a Maverick : His signatures are Rockford and Maverick—can anybody in Hollywood do cool and canny better than James Garner? |work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 15, 1994|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-15/entertainment/ca-57884_1_james-garner|accessdate=November 23, 2010|first=Carla|last=Hall}}</ref> In 1995, he played lead character Woodrow Call, an ex-lawman, in the TV miniseries sequel to ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'' entitled ''[[Streets of Laredo]]'', based on [[Larry McMurtry]]'s book. In 1996, Garner and [[Jack Lemmon]] teamed up in ''[[My Fellow Americans]]'', playing two former presidents who uncover scandalous activity by their successor ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) and are pursued by murderous [[NSA]] agents.<ref name="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=myfellowamericans.htm">{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=myfellowamericans.htm | title=Box Office Mojo – My Fellow Americans | accessdate=September 14, 2011}}</ref> In addition to a major recurring role during the last part of the run of TV series ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', Garner also starred in two short-lived series, the animated ''[[God, the Devil and Bob]]'' and ''[[First Monday]]'', in which he played a Supreme Court justice.

===Later years===
In 2000, after an operation to replace both knees,<ref name = "http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/12/entertainment/ca-18538"> {{cite news | last = King | first = Susan | title = At 'Chicago Hope,' They've Called In a Maverick Talent | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = April 12, 2000 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/12/entertainment/ca-18538 | accessdate = July 23, 2014 }}</ref> Garner appeared with Clint Eastwood (who had played a villain in the original ''Maverick'' series) as [[astronaut]]s in the movie ''[[Space Cowboys]]'',<ref name="Indie" /> also featuring [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and [[Donald Sutherland]].

In 2001, Garner voiced the main antagonist, Commander Rourke, in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]''. In 2002, following the death of [[James Coburn]], Garner took over Coburn's role as TV commercial voiceover for Chevrolet's "Like a Rock" advertising campaign. Garner continued to voice the commercials until the end of the campaign. Also in 2002, he played Sandra Bullock's father in ''The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' as Shepard James "Shep" Walker.  After the death of [[John Ritter]] in 2003, Garner joined the cast of ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'' as [[CJ Barnes|Grandpa Jim Egan]] (Cate's father)<ref>{{cite news|title=James Garner to Join '8 Simple Rules'|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,627118,00.html|accessdate=July 21, 2014|publisher=People|date=October 16, 2003}}</ref> and remained with the series until it finished in 2005.

In 2004, Garner starred as the older version of [[Ryan Gosling]]'s character in the film version of [[Nicholas Sparks (author)|Nicholas Sparks]]' ''[[The Notebook (2004 film)|The Notebook]]'' alongside [[Gena Rowlands]] as his wife, directed by [[Nick Cassavetes]], Rowlands' son. The [[Screen Actors Guild]] nominated Garner as best actor for "Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role."<ref>[http://www.sagawards.org/awards/nominees-and-recipients/11th-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards The 11th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards | Screen Actors Guild Awards<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2010, Garner voiced the wizard [[Shazam (character)|Shazam]] in the direct-to-video animated feature ''[[Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=R.I.P. TV and Film Icon James Garner, 1928–2014|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/07/20/r-i-p-tv-and-film-icon-james-garner-1928-2014/|accessdate=July 21, 2014|publisher=Comicbook.com}}</ref>

On November 1, 2011, Simon & Schuster published Garner's autobiography ''The Garner Files: A Memoir''. In addition to recounting his career, the memoir, co-written with nonfiction writer Jon Winokur, detailed the childhood abuses Garner suffered at the hands of his stepmother. It also offered frank, unflattering assessments of some of Garner's co-stars such as Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson. In addition to recalling the genesis of most of Garner's hit films and television shows, the book also featured a section where the star provided individual critiques for every one of his acting projects accompanied by a star rating for each. Garner's three-time co-star Julie Andrews wrote the book's foreword. Lauren Bacall, Diahann Carroll, Doris Day, Tom Selleck, and Stephen J. Cannell and many other Garner associates, friends, and relatives provided their memories of the star in the book's coda.<ref name="MJref">{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/287535/James-Garner-Why-Steve-McQueen-was-like-my-little-brother/ |title=James Garner: Why Steve McQueen was like my little brother |date=December 3, 2011 |accessdate=July 20, 2014}}</ref>

The "most explosive revelation" in his autobiography was that Garner smoked marijuana for much of his adult life. "I started smoking it in my late teens," Garner wrote. <blockquote>I drank to get drunk but ultimately didn't like the effect. Not so with grass. It had the opposite effect from alcohol: it made me more tolerant and forgiving. I did a little bit of cocaine in the Eighties, courtesy of John Belushi, but fortunately I didn't like it. But I smoked marijuana for 50 years and I don’t know where I'd be without it. It opened my mind and now it eases my arthritis. After decades of research I’ve concluded that marijuana should be legal and alcohol illegal.<ref name="MJref" /></blockquote>

===Awards===
Nominated for 15 Emmy Awards during his television career, Garner received the award in 1977 as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (''The Rockford Files'') and in 1987 as executive producer of the film ''[[Promise (film)|Promise]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/james-garner |title=James Garner |publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences |accessdate=2014-08-16}}</ref>

He was also inducted into the [[Television Hall of Fame]] that same year. In February 2005, he received the [[Screen Actors Guild]]'s Lifetime Achievement Award.<ref name="irish"/><ref name="Indie"/> He was also nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role that year, for ''[[The Notebook (2004 film)|The Notebook]].'' When Morgan Freeman won that prize for his work in ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'', he led the audience in a sing-along of the original ''Maverick'' theme song, written by [[David Buttolph]] and [[Paul Francis Webster]].

In 2010, the [[Television Critics Association]] gave Garner its annual Career Achievement Award.

===Politics===
[[File:Warner Brothers television westerns stars 1959.JPG|right|thumb|1959 [[Warner Bros.]] series leads [[Will Hutchins]] (''[[Sugarfoot]]''), [[Peter Brown (actor)|Peter Brown]] (''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]''), [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] (''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]''), [[Ty Hardin]] (''[[Bronco (TV series)|Bronco]]''), Garner, [[Wayde Preston]] ''([[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]''), and [[John Russell (actor)|John Russell]] (''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'')]]

Garner was a strong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] supporter. From 1982, Garner gave at least $29,000 to Federal campaigns, of which over $24,000 was to Democratic Party candidates, including [[Dennis Kucinich]] (for Congress in 2002), [[Dick Gephardt]], [[John Kerry]], [[Barbara Boxer]], and various Democratic committees and groups.<ref>[http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/James_Garner.php Garner's Federal campaign contributions] Newsmeat.com</ref>

On August 28, 1963, Garner was one of several celebrities to join [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in the "[[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]." In his autobiography, Garner recalled sitting in the third row listening to King's "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech.

For his role in the 1985 CBS miniseries [[Space (miniseries)|''Space'']], the character's party affiliation was changed from [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] as in the book to reflect Garner's personal views. Garner said, "My wife would leave me if I played a Republican."<ref>Thomas, Jack. "Keep Your Eye On This Space". ''Boston Globe'' (April 13, 1985)</ref>

There was an effort by California Democratic party leaders, led by state [[California State Senate|Senator]] [[Herschel Rosenthal]], to persuade Garner to seek the Democratic nomination for [[Governor of California]] in the 1990 election. However, future [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] and former [[Mayor of San Francisco|San Francisco Mayor]] [[Dianne Feinstein]] received the nomination instead, losing to Republican [[Pete Wilson]] in the election.<ref>Kasindorf, Martin. – "From Hollywood".
