== Career ==

Bardem came to notice in a small role in his first major motion picture, ''[[The Ages of Lulu]]'', when he was 20, in which he appeared along with his mother, [[Pilar Bardem]]. [[Bigas Luna]], the director of ''Lulu'', was sufficiently impressed to give him the leading male role in his next film, ''Jamón Jamón'' in 1992, in which Bardem played a would-be [[underwear model]] and [[bullfighter]]. The film, which also starred a teenaged [[Penélope Cruz]], was a major international success.<ref name="mirror" /> He then starred again in Luna's next film ''[[Golden Balls (film)|Golden Balls]]'' (1993).

Bardem's talent did not go unnoticed in the [[English-speaking world]]. In 1997, [[John Malkovich]] was the first to approach him, then a 27-year-old, for a role in English, but the Spanish actor turned down the offer because his English was still poor.<ref name="rugby" /><ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/cs/interviews/a/javierbardem_2.htm|title=Javier Bardem on John Malkovich and "The Dancer Upstairs"|last=Murray|first=Rebecca|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> His first English-speaking role came that same year, in with director [[Alex de la Iglesia]]'s ''[[Perdita Durango]]'', playing a [[santería]]-practicing bank robber. After starring in about two dozen films in his native country, he gained international recognition in [[Julian Schnabel]]'s ''[[Before Night Falls (film)|Before Night Falls]]'' in 2000, portraying [[Cuba]]n poet [[Reinaldo Arenas]].<ref name="mirror" /> He received praise from his idol [[Al Pacino]]; the message Pacino left on Bardem's answering machine was something he considers one of the most beautiful gifts he has ever received.<ref name="the guardian" /> For that role, he received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], the first for a Spaniard. Immediately after, he turned down the role of "Witwer" in ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' which eventually went to [[Colin Farrell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/trivia?tr=tr0770324|title=Trivia for Minority Report|year=2002|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> Instead, in 2002, Bardem starred in [[John Malkovich]]'s directorial debut, ''[[The Dancer Upstairs (film)|The Dancer Upstairs]]''. Malkovich originally had the Spanish actor in mind for the role of the detective's assistant, but the movie took so long to obtain financing it gave Bardem time to learn English and take on the lead role of the detective. "I will always be grateful to him because he really gave me my very first chance to work in English," Bardem has said of Malkovich.<ref name="rugby" /><ref name="about" />
