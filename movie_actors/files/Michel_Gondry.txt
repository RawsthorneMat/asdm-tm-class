'''Michel Gondry''' (born May 8, 1963) is a [[French people|French]] [[film director]], [[screenwriter]], and [[Producer (film)|producer]]. He is noted for his inventive visual style and distinctive manipulation of [[mise en scène]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Sexton|first=Jamie|title=Music, Sound and Multimedia: From the Live to the Virtual|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7486-2534-5|page=34|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1v1cE-J_sg4C&lpg=PA34&dq=mise%20en%20sc%C3%A8ne%20gondry&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> He won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] as one of the writers of ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004), which is often ranked one of the greatest films of the 2000s.

His other films include the surrealistic science fantasy comedy ''[[The Science of Sleep]]'' (2006), the comedy-drama ''[[Be Kind Rewind]]'' (2008), the  superhero action comedy ''[[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|The Green Hornet]]'' (2011), the drama ''[[The We and the I]]'' (2012), and the romantic drama ''[[Mood Indigo (film)|Mood Indigo]]'' (2013).

==Early life==
Gondry was born in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]. He is the grandson of inventor [[Constant Martin]].<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/arts/announcements/prs/2005/0318_gondry.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>

==Career==
Gondry's vision and career began with his emphasis on emotion. Much of his inspiration, he says, came from the film [[Stowaway in the Sky|''Le voyage en ballon'']]. He stated: "When I watch this movie, I dream I'm flying and then I do stories where people are flying. I think it's directly influencing."<ref>Gondry, Michel. Interview by Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life. By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p151. Print.</ref>

His career as a filmmaker began with creating [[music video]]<nowiki/>s for the French rock band [[Oui Oui]], in which he also served as a drummer. The style of his videos for Oui Oui caught the attention of music artist [[Björk]], who asked him to direct the video for her song "[[Human Behaviour]]". The collaboration proved long-lasting, with Gondry directing a total of eight music videos for Björk. Other artists who have collaborated with Gondry on more than one occasion include [[Daft Punk]], [[The White Stripes]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]], [[Steriogram]], [[Radiohead]], and [[Beck]]. Gondry has also created numerous television commercials. He pioneered the "[[Bullet Time|bullet time]]" technique later adapted in ''[[The Matrix]]'' (he met [[Joel Silver]], the producer of the film, and said he had no choice but to accept the deal for a small amount) in a 1998 commercial for [[Smirnoff]] [[vodka]], as well as directing a trio of inventive holiday-themed advertisements for clothing retailer [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]].

Gondry, along with directors [[Spike Jonze]] and [[David Fincher]], is representative of the influx of music video directors into feature film. Gondry made his feature film debut in 2001 with ''[[Human Nature (film)|Human Nature]]'', garnering mixed reviews. His second film, ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (also his second collaboration with screenwriter [[Charlie Kaufman]]), was released in 2004 and received very favorable reviews, becoming one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year. ''Eternal Sunshine'' utilizes many of the image manipulation techniques that Gondry had experimented with in his music videos. Gondry won an [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Academy Award]] alongside Kaufman and [[Pierre Bismuth]] for the screenplay of ''Eternal Sunshine''. The style of Gondry's music videos often relies on videography and camera tricks which play with [[frames of reference]].

Gondry also directed the musical documentary ''[[Dave Chappelle's Block Party]]'' (2006) which followed comedian [[Dave Chappelle]] as he attempted to hold a large, free concert in the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]]. His following film, ''[[The Science of Sleep]]'', hit theaters in September 2006. This film stars Mexican actor [[Gael García Bernal]], and marked a return to the fantastical, surreal techniques he employed in ''Eternal Sunshine''.

According to the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Records 2004]], Michel Gondry's [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's 501 Jeans]] "Drugstore" spot holds the record for "Most awards won by a TV commercial".<ref>{{cite book |title=Guinness World Records 2004 |year=2003 |publisher=Little Brown & Co |isbn=978-1-892051-20-2 |page=177 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-Vl6AAAACAAJ&dq=guinness+world+records+2004}}</ref> The commercial was never aired in North America because of the suggestive content involving purchasing latex condoms.

He was asked by French comic duet [[Éric and Ramzy]] to direct ''[[:fr:Seuls Two|Seuls Two]]'', but declined; by his suggestion, Éric and Ramzy subsequently asked [[Mr Oizo]] to direct another movie, ''[[:fr:Steak (film)|Steak]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infosjeunes.com/Steak-en-DVD-le-20-decembre-2007_a70285.html |title=Steak en DVD le 20 décembre 2007 |publisher=Infosjeunes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}</ref>

In September 2006, Gondry made his debut as an [[installation art]]ist at [[Deitch Projects]] in New York City's [[SoHo]] gallery district. The show, called "The Science of Sleep: An Exhibition of Sculpture and Pathological Creepy Little Gifts" featured props from his film, ''[[The Science of Sleep]]'', as well as film clips and a selection of gifts that the artist had given to women he was interested in, many of them former or current collaborators, Karen Baird, Kishu Chand, Dorothy Barrick and Lauri Faggioni.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/reviews/davis/davis9-20-06.asp |title=Dream Factory - artnet Magazine |publisher=Artnet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}</ref> A [[leitmotif]] of the film is a 'Disastrology' calendar; Gondry commissioned the painter Baptiste Ibar to draw harrowing images of natural and human disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baptisteibar.com |title=Baptiste Ibar |publisher=Baptiste Ibar |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}</ref>

His brother Olivier "Twist" Gondry is also a television commercial and music video director creating videos for bands such as [[The Stills]], [[Hot Hot Heat]], [[Daft Punk]] and [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]].<ref>[http://www.methodstudios.com/moy64 ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>

Gondry was an Artist in Residence at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 2005 and 2006. Later directing the music video for the Paul McCartney song "[[Dance Tonight]]", in which Gondry makes a [[cameo appearance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOcIzRY7CcE |title=Memory Almost Full EPK |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-05-23 |accessdate=2014-08-06}}</ref> Gondry directed "[[Unnatural Love]]", the fifth episode in season two of HBO's [[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|''Flight of the Conchords'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flicksnews.net/2009/02/michel-gondry-directs-flight-of.html|title=Michel Gondry Directs Flight of the Conchords Episode|publisher=Flicks News|accessdate=February 16, 2009}}</ref> Interior Design one third of the 2008 [[anthology film]] ''[[Tokyo!]]'' was next for Gondry. Interior Design was based on the comic book "Cecil and Jordan in New York" by [[Gabrielle Bell]] but was adapted from New York City to Tokyo for the film.

In 2009, ''[[The Thorn in the Heart]]'', another feature documentary, was released, it is about Michel's aunt Suzette and her son Jean-Yves. In 2011, Gondry directed ''[[The Green Hornet (2011 film)|The Green Hornet]]'', a superhero film by [[Sony]] starring [[Seth Rogen]], [[Jay Chou]] and [[Christoph Waltz]]; Rogen co-wrote the script.
