Born in 1956 into a Tamil Iyer Family at Madurai, TamilNadu,<ref name="ibnlive.com"/> Mani Ratnam's family was closely associated with film production. His father, S. G. Ratnam, was a film distributor who worked for Venus Pictures,<ref name=gvenk/> while his uncle 'Venus' Krishnamurthy was a film producer. Mani grew up in [[Madras]] (now Chennai),<ref name="The New Indian Express">{{cite web|last=Singh|first=Vidya|url=http://newindianexpress.com/entertainment/interviews/article277550.ece|title=Maniratnam, the filmmaker|work=The New Indian Express|date=3 November 2011|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> along with his brothers and cousins in a joint-family. Despite being a film family, the children were not allowed to watch films as the elders considered it a taboo".{{Sfn|Rangan|2014|loc= chpt. Pallavi Anupallavi, Unaru, Pagal Nilavu, Idhayakoil}} However, they were allowed to watch the shoot of films produced by them. Mani started watching films more actively while he was studying in the Besant Theosophical School, [[Adyar, Chennai|Adyar]], Madras.{{Sfn|Rangan|2014|loc= chpt. Pallavi Anupallavi, Unaru, Pagal Nilavu, Idhayakoil}} During this time, he started admiring actors like [[Sivaji Ganesan]] and [[Nagesh]], and watched all their films. At the age of 15, he got to know about director [[K. Balachander]] and became a fan of his. Upon completing his schooling, he graduated with a degree in commerce from the [[Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda College]], affiliated with [[University of Madras|Madras University]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dff.nic.in/madras.htm|title=International Film Festival of India 2002, Madras Talkies "Kannathil Muthamittal"|work=Directorate of Film Festivals|date=26 September 2002|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> and then went to [[Bombay]] to pursue his [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] in finance from [[Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Mani mantra for B-school|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1070910/asp/bengal/story_8298530.asp|accessdate=10 September 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=10 September 2007|location=Calcutta, India}}</ref> After finishing his post-graduation in 1977, he was employed in a firm as a management consultant where he continued to work for sometime.<ref name=jmnlal/>

==Film career==

===Beginnings: 1977-1983===
Mani Ratnam was not satisfied with his job as a consultant as he found it to be a mere extension of his academics. During this time, Ravi Shankar, a friend of his, and the son of director [[B. R. Panthulu]], was in the process of making his first film, in [[Kannada language|Kannada]]. Mani accompanied Ravi Shankar along with another friend called Raman, son of [[S. Balachander]], to complete the script of the film.{{Sfn|Rangan|2014|loc= chpt. Pallavi Anupallavi, Unaru, Pagal Nilavu, Idhayakoil}} Mani took a sabbatical from his job in order to make himself involve in the making of the film. Being inexperienced, the crew were largely dependent upon ''[[American Cinematographer]]''. The principal cast included [[Vishnuvardhan (actor)|Vishnuvardhan]], [[Srinath (actor)|Srinath]], [[Ambarish]], [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] and [[Roja Ramani]]. When the filming was about to begin in [[Kolar]], [[Karnataka]], Mani Ratnam left his consulting job and joined the crew. The film, however, did not take off and was eventually shelved. Mani Ratnam was firm in his idea of becoming a film-maker, though his family was not fully supportive of his idea. Though he was not pleased with the films made in Tamil cinema till then, he was amazed at [[P. Bharathiraja]]'s ''[[16 Vayathinile]]'' and [[J. Mahendran]]'s ''[[Mullum Malarum]]'', and ''[[Uthiripookkal]]'', that came around this time. During this time, he befriended a group of people including [[P. C. Sreeram]], [[Santhana Bharathi]] and [[P. Vasu]] who had similar passions of entering into the film industry .{{Sfn|Rangan|2014|loc= chpt. Pallavi Anupallavi, Unaru, Pagal Nilavu, Idhayakoil}}

With a script in hand, Mani Ratnam had an idea to either get a producer for his film, or to narrate the script to a "celebrated" film-maker so that he could get a chance to work along with them and get to know about the various aspects involved in film-making. He chose three directors—Balachander, Bharathiraja and Mahendran. As the attempts to meet and convince all the three proved to be unsuccessful, he decided to look out for a producer. In the process, he along with Sreeram—to be his cinematographer—met around 20 people, with all the efforts being unsuccessful.{{Sfn|Rangan|2014|loc= chpt. Pallavi Anupallavi, Unaru, Pagal Nilavu, Idhayakoil}}

===Early years and struggle: 1983-1986===
Mani Ratnam developed his script—originally written in English—into a film and named it ''[[Pallavi Anu Pallavi]]''. His uncle Krishnamurthy agreed to produce the film but imposed a condition that it should be made in Kannada and with a limited budget. As a debutant, Mani Ratnam wanted to make sure that the technical aspects of the film are good. He persuaded [[Balu Mahendra]] to do the cinematography as he found the latter's work to be very impressive.<ref name=debut/> He managed to get other crew members [[B. Lenin]] ([[Film editing|Editor]]), [[Thotta Tharani]] ([[Production designer]]) and [[Ilaiyaraaja]] ([[Music composer]]), all leading craftsmen in their respective fields then. For the male lead, he cast [[Anil Kapoor]] after watching his performance in ''[[Vamsa Vruksham]]''. [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] who was a leading actress then, was cast as the female lead.<ref name=debut>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2010/08/27/stories/2010082750800200.htm|title=A life in cinema|work=The Hindu|date=27 August 2010|accessdate=11 March 2012|author=P. K, Ajith Kumar}}</ref> The film explored the relationship between a young man and an older woman. Although an average grosser at the box-office, the film fetched the [[Karnataka State Film Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay Award]] from the [[Karnataka State Film Awards|Karnataka State Government]] for the year 1983.<ref name="dff114">{{cite web|url=http://iffi.nic.in/Dff2011/Frm34ndNFAAward.aspx?PdfName=34NFA.pdf|title=Directorate of Film Festival|publisher=[[Directorate of Film Festivals]]|format= PDF|accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref> After watching ''Pallavi Anu Pallavi'', N. G. John, a Malayalam film producer, offered Mani Ratnam a chance to direct a film in Malayalam. Scripted by [[T. Damodaran]], ''[[Unaru]]'' was about the corruption in labour unions of [[Kerala]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/03/02/stories/2005030200630100.htm|title=Mani on Mani|work=The Hindu|date=2 March 2005|accessdate=11 March 2012|author=Subramanian, Samanth}}</ref> The film was completed with in two  months and got released in April 1984. Mani Ratnam attributed the failure of the film to the conflict of interests that he and the producer had.{{Sfn|Rangan|2014|loc= chpt. Pallavi Anupallavi, Unaru, Pagal Nilavu, Idhayakoil}} Following this, he had his break in Tamil cinema when G. Thyagarajan of Sathya Jyothi Films offered him to direct ''[[Pagal Nilavu]]'' (1985). The film had [[Murali (Tamil actor)|Murali]] and [[Revathi Menon|Revathi]] playing lead roles.<ref>{{cite web|author= Srinivasan, Pavithra|url=http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/sep/09/slide-show-1-south-looking-at-muralis-films.htm|title=Pagal Nilavu (1985)|work=Rediff|date=9 September 2010|accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref> It was different from his previous two films in a way that it included dance sequences and a comedy "track". However, the film turned out to be another failure for him. The same year, he got an offer to direct another Tamil film ''[[Idaya Kovil]]'', a [[romantic drama]]. He remodelled a ready made script on the lines of [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' (1952). Described by himself as an unsatisfied work, the film was a major box-office success.<ref name="dff114"/> Mani Ratnam described the phase between the years 1983 and 1986 to be the toughest of his career, with only ''Pallavi Anupallavi'' being a satisfiable film, as the rest three were done with a lot of "compromises".{{Sfn|Rangan|2014|loc= chpt. Pallavi Anupallavi, Unaru, Pagal Nilavu, Idhayakoil}}

===Breakthrough: 1986–1991===
In 1986, Ratnam directed the Tamil romantic drama ''[[Mouna Ragam]]'', which starred [[Revathi]] and [[Mohan (actor)|Mohan]].
