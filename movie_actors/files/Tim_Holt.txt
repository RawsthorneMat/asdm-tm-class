They cast him in the Western ''The Renegade Ranger'' supporting George O'Brien, who was their leading star of B-westerns. RKO tried him again in ''[[The Law West of Tombstone]]''. Wanger then used Holt in the role of young Lieutenant Blanchard in the 1939 classic ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', then his contract expired. However RKO signed Holt to a seven year contract in December 1938.<ref>Holt played young Lieutenant Blanchard in the 1939 classic ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]''.</ref><ref>"Screen News Here and in Hollywood: Dick Powell, Joan Blondell to Leave Warners – Miss Lindsay in Mystery Play – Two Foreign Films Today 'Little Flower,' Made in France, and the Italian, 'Amore in Quarantena,' Will Open, Miss Lindsay Gets Lead, Coast Scripts Of Local Origin, Special to The New York Times".

===RKO===
Holt soon became a favorite with RKO management, starring opposite [[Ginger Rogers]] and playing important roles in films such as ''[[The Girl and the Gambler]]'' and ''Swiss Family Robinson''. Although he initially appeared in a number of different genres, he was particularly effective in Westerns and RKO decided to star him in a series of low budget B-westerns. These proved highly popular and Holt wound up making 46 of them for the studio in all. Holt usually played a cowboy who had one or two friends, who occasionally sang. His most frequent director was [[Lesley Selander]].

Holt would occasionally make other movies. His best known one was the lead in [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' (1942). He also starred as a Nazi in ''[[Hitler's Children (1943 film)|Hitler's Children]]'' (1943), which was one of RKO's most profitable films during the war.

Holt became a decorated combat veteran of [[World War II]], flying in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theatre]] with the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a [[B-29]] bombardier.<ref name="nytimes"/> He was wounded over Tokyo on the last day of the war and was awarded a purple heart.<ref>Hopper, Hedda.

===Post-war===
[[File:Tim Holt in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre trailer.jpg|thumb|Tim Holt in the trailer for ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948)]]
Following the war, Holt returned to films, appearing as [[Virgil Earp]] to [[Henry Fonda]]'s [[Wyatt Earp]] in the [[John Ford]] western ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946).

Holt was next cast in the role that he is probably best remembered for (in a film in which his father also appeared in a small part)&mdash;that of Bob Curtin to [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s Fred C. Dobbs in [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948).

Before the film was released, Holt did another four westerns and afterward made two dozen more up until 1952, when television eroded the B-western market.

===Later career===
Holt was then absent from the screen for five years until he starred in a less-than-successful [[horror film]], ''[[The Monster That Challenged the World]]'', in 1957. Over the next 16 years, he appeared in only two more motion pictures. However he kept busy managing theatres and making personal appearances.<ref name="nytimes"/> He worked as a builder, produced rodeos, staged and performed Western music jamborees, and worked as an advertising manager for a radio station.<ref name=Mott/>

==Personal life==
Holt was married three times and had four children: three sons (one to his first marriage), and a daughter.

Tim Holt died from [[bone cancer]] on February 15, 1973<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19730216&id=OYMuAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qqEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4730,4332280 Western star Tim Holt dies]</ref> in [[Shawnee, Oklahoma]], where he had been managing a [[radio station]]. He was interred in the Memory Lane Cemetery in [[Harrah, Oklahoma]]. Tim Holt Drive in Harrah, where he and his wife had lived, was subsequently named in his honor.<ref name="nytimes"/>

==Legacy==
Robert Mott of the ''Washington Post'' later said of Holt:
<blockquote>Holt was the hero, strong and silent and always more comfortable in the presence of boots and saddles, horses and he-men, than with the heroine – though he almost invariably ended up marrying her... Like many sons of famous entertainers, Tim Holt never achieved the stature of his father, and projected a bland image in contrast  with the elder Holt's strong characterisation.<ref name=Mott/></blockquote>
In 1991, Tim Holt was inducted posthumously into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].
