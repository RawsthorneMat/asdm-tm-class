==Career==
Corbin began his career as a [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actor in the 1960s, but today he is more likely to be seen in the role of the local sheriff, military leader, or some other authority figure, though on occasion, he has effectively portrayed murderous [[villain]]s as well. To moviegoers he is well remembered as General Beringer in ''[[WarGames]]'', [[John Travolta]]'s uncle Bob Davis in ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', co-starring with Clint Eastwood in ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'', or Roscoe Brown, July Johnson's bumbling deputy in the acclaimed western ''[[Lonesome Dove]]''.

From 1979 until 1984, he appeared in several episodes of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' as Sheriff Fenton Washburn. In 1983, Corbin co-starred in the famed television miniseries ''[[The Thorn Birds]]''. Corbin played Mary Carson's stockman Pete, who teaches the Cleary's sons how to shear sheep on their aunt's gigantic sheep station Drogheda, in Australia. In 1983-1984, Corbin played Merit Sawyer in the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Boone (TV series)|Boone]]''. Corbin's role was that of a stern father to the young actor [[Tom Byrd]], who played Boone Sawyer, an aspiring singer. The program was set in [[rural area|rural]] [[Tennessee]] during the 1950s and was created by [[Earl Hamner]], who had great success earlier with CBS's ''[[The Waltons]]''. From 1990 to 1995, Corbin portrayed former [[astronaut]] [[Maurice Minnifield]] on CBS's ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', for which he received an [[Emmy Award]] nomination.<ref name="Barry Corbin">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0179224/ Barry Corbin] from [http://www.imdb.com The Internet Movie Database]</ref>

In 1994, Corbin narrated the acclaimed [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] documentary ''MoonShot'', telling the story of the 1960s [[space race]] from the first-person viewpoint of [[Mercury Seven]] astronaut [[Deke Slayton]]. In 2007, He played the character Clay Johnson, father of Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson on ''The Closer'' series.<ref name="Barry Corbin"/>

Corbin lost most of his hair in the 1990s due to [[alopecia areata]]. Since then, he has played various roles with a shaved head, wearing a cowboy hat, or occasionally wearing a full [[toupee]]. Corbin is the signature voice of radio station [[KPLX]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], and has also voiced trailers and promos for CMT and various other country radio stations.<ref>[http://www.barrycorbin.com/articles.htm Barrycorbin.com]</ref> In 2014 he became the spokesman for The [[Texas Veterans Land Board]].

==Personal life==
Many of his films have been westerns, and Corbin's proficiency in the saddle is no act. Corbin won many [[Cutting (sport)|cutting-horse]] competitions before breaking into film.<ref name="statesman" /> Much of his spare time is spent riding horses and tending to cattle on his small Texas ranch near [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. He has volunteered his time to charity for many years, including [[rodeo]]s and being spokesman for the [[National Alopecia Areata Foundation]].<ref name="statesman" /> In 2006, he participated in the Lubbock [[centennial]].<ref>[http://www.barrycorbin.com/awards.htm The Official Barry Corbin Site | Achievement<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Corbin has been quoted as being an avid enthusiast of riding horses.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0179224/bio Barry Corbin Biography] from [http://www.imdb.com The Internet Movie Database]</ref>

Corbin lives on the ranch with his daughter, Shannon Ross (born 1965) and grandchildren. Shannon had been adopted as an infant; her birth mother, who had an affair with Corbin, gave up the child through the Methodist Mission Home in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], without having told Corbin of the [[pregnancy]]. Corbin found Shannon in June 1991, when she was twenty-six. Corbin has three sons: Bernard (born 1970), [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2160188/ Jim] (born 1979), and [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2347426/ Christopher] (born 1982).
