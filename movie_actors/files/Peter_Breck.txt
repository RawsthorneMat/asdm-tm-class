==Career==

===Early career===
After [[United States Navy]] service on the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Franklin D. Roosevelt|CV-42}}, Breck studied drama at the [[University of Houston]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], Texas. He made his debut in a film that was eventually released under the title ''[[The Beatniks (film)]]''. As well as performing in live theatre, Breck had several guest-starring roles on a number of popular series, such as ''[[Sea Hunt]]'', several episodes of ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''. In 1956, he and [[David Janssen]] appeared in [[John Bromfield]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] series ''[[Sheriff of Cochise]]'' in the episode entitled "The Turkey Farmers". He appeared in another syndicated series too in the episode "The Deserter" of the [[American Civil War]] drama ''[[Gray Ghost (TV series)|Gray Ghost]]'', with [[Tod Andrews]] in the title role.

When [[Robert Mitchum]] saw Breck in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[The Man of Destiny]]'' in [[Washington, D.C.]], he offered Breck a role as a rival driver in ''[[Thunder Road (film)|Thunder Road]]'' (1958).  Mitchum helped Breck to relocate to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]]. As Breck then did not have his own car, Mitchum lent him his own [[Jaguar car|Jaguar]].<ref>http://www.peterbreck.ca/introduction.htm</ref>  Mitchum introduced Breck to [[Dick Powell]] who contracted him to [[Four Star Productions]] where Breck appeared in the [[CBS]] western [[anthology series]], ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater]]''. He also appeared with fellow guest star [[Diane Brewster]] in the 1958 episode "The Lady Gambler" of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] western series, ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'', starring [[Pat Conway]] and [[Richard Eastham]]. That same year, Breck appeared in an episode of the syndicated ''[[Highway Patrol (TV series)|Highway Patrol]]'', starring [[Broderick Crawford]]. He was cast too in an episode of NBC's ''[[The Restless Gun]]'', starring [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]]''.

From January 1959 to May 1960, Breck starred as Clay Culhane, the gunfighter-turned-[[lawyer]] in the ABC western ''[[Black Saddle]]'', with secondary roles for [[Russell Johnson]], [[Anna-Lisa]], [[J. Pat O'Malley]], and [[Walter Burke]]. Unlike in ''The Big Valley'', in which Breck played an easily  angered rancher, he is low-key, restrained, and considerate as the lawyer Culhane.

Breck was later a contract star with [[Warner Bros. Television]],  where he appeared as Doc Holliday on ''Maverick'', a part that had been played twice earlier in the series by [[Gerald Mohr]] and by [[Adam West]] on ABC's ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]''.  Breck appeared in several other ABC/WB series of the time, such as ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'', ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]'', ''[[The Roaring Twenties (TV series)|The Roaring Twenties]]'' (as trumpet player Joe Peabody in the episode "Big Town Blues"), and ''[[The Gallant Men]]''. He was cast as a young [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the 1961 episode "The Yankee Tornado" of the ABC/WB western series, ''[[Bronco (TV series)|Bronco]]'', starring [[Ty Hardin]]. "The Yankee Tornado" features [[Will Hutchins]] of the ABC/WB western series ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' in a crossover appearance.

Breck's first starring role in a film was ''[[Lad, A Dog (film)|Lad, A Dog]]'' in 1962.<ref name="TCM">{{cite web |title=Lad: A Dog (1962) |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=80570 |accessdate=October 22, 2009}}</ref> The next year, he played the leading roles in both [[Samuel Fuller]]'s ''[[Shock Corridor]]'' and the [[science fiction]] horror film ''[[The Crawling Hand]]''. Between 1963 and 1965 Breck made three guest appearances on ''[[Perry Mason]]'', including the roles of defendant William Sherwood in the 1964 episode, "The Case of the Antic Angel," and defendant Peter Warren in the 1965 episode, "The Case of the Gambling Lady." During this time, he also appeared on episodes of such television series as ''[[Mr. Novak]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', and ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''.

Breck claimed to have been considered for leads in two successful television series produced by [[Quinn Martin]] ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitve]]'' (1963) and ''[[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|12 O'Clock High]]'' (1964) with Breck commenting that "If you are a leading man in Hollywood you either draw $250,000 like Steve McQueen or you had better be in a series".<ref>Crosby, Joan ''Warner Bros Can't Afford Peter Breck'' ''Ocala Star Banner'' p. 12 26 July 1965</ref>

===''The Big Valley''===
From 1965 to 1969, Breck starred in ''The Big Valley'', having portrayed Nick Barkley, [[ramrod]] of the Barkley ranch and son to Barbara Stanwyck's character, Victoria Barkley. The second of four children, Nick was hotheaded, short-tempered, and very fast with a gun.  Always spoiling for a fight and frequently wearing leather gloves, Breck's character took the slightest offense to the Barkley name personally and quickly made his displeasure known, as often with his fists as with his vociferous shouts. Often this proved to be a mistake and only through the calming influence of his mother and cooler-headed siblings, Jarrod ([[Richard Long (actor)|Richard Long]]), half-brother Heath ([[Lee Majors]]), sister Audra ([[Linda Evans]]) and Eugene ([[Charles Briles]]; written out after season 1 when he was drafted into the Army), would a difficult situation be rectified. Having been a Barbara Stanwyck admirer since the 1940s, when he was teenager, Breck developed an on- and off-screen chemistry with her, practicing longer lines and even being a ranch foreman on the set. After the show was canceled, he stayed close to her until her death.

===After ''The Big Valley''===
In 1969, Breck was cast in an episode of ''[[The Donald O'Connor Show]]''. Most of his roles in the 1970s and 1980s were television guest-starring performances on such series as ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[McMillan & Wife]]'', ''[[S.W.A.T. (TV series)|S.W.A.T.]]'', ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' (again with Lee Majors), ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1977 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', and ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', as well as roles as himself on ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', and ''[[The Fall Guy]]'' which also starred former television "brother" Lee Majors.

In the mid-1980s, Breck moved to [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], with his wife Diane and their son, Christoper. He was asked by a casting director to teach a weekly class to young actors on film technique. That once-a-week class became a full-time acting school - '''The Breck Academy''' - which he operated for 10 years. In 1990, Breck appeared in the Canadian cult film ''[[Terminal City Ricochet]]''.

On January 20, 1990, while teaching at the drama school, Breck was notified of Barbara Stanwyck's death. She requested no funeral nor memorial.   
 
In the 1993 movie ''[[The Unnamable II: The Statement of Randolph Carter]]'', Breck played Sheriff Hatch.

In 1996, he appeared in an episode of the new version of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''.

Breck provided the voice of Farmer Brown in "Critters", a 1998 episode of ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.<ref name=cartoon>{{cite news |url=http://blog.bcdb.com/peter-breck-nick-the-big-valley-dead-82-3045/ |title=Peter Breck, Nick in "The Big Valley," dead at 82|first=Ethan |last=Ethan Minovitz|newspaper=Big Cartoon News |date=12 February 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2012 }}</ref>

His last television performance was on an episode of ''[[John Doe (TV series)|John Doe]]'' in 2002. Prior to his death, most of his film performances have been in undistributed films that are shown only at [[film festival]]s.

==Death==

In June 2010, Breck's wife Diane announced on his website that the actor had been suffering from [[dementia]] and could no longer sign autographs for fans, although she said that he still read and enjoyed their letters. Despite this diagnosis, she said he was still physically healthy and did not require medication.<ref name="dbreck">{{cite web
