'''Julie London''' (born '''Gayle Peck'''; September 26, 1926&nbsp;– October 18, 2000) was an American jazz and pop [[singing|singer]] and actress. She was noted for her smoky, sensual voice and languid demeanor. She released 32 albums of pop and jazz standards during the 1950s and 1960s, with her signature song being the classic "[[Cry Me a River]]," which she introduced in 1955.

London's 35-year acting career began in films in 1944 and included playing opposite [[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Man of the West]]'' (1958) and [[Robert Mitchum]] in ''[[The Wonderful Country]]'' (1959). She achieved continuing success in the TV [[medical drama]] ''[[Emergency!]]'' (1972–1979), co-starring her real-life husband, [[Bobby Troup]], and produced by her ex-husband, [[Jack Webb]], in which London played the female lead role of nurse [[Dixie McCall]].

==Early life==
London was born '''Gayle Peck''' on September 26, 1926, in [[Santa Rosa, California]], the daughter of Jack and Josephine Peck, who were a [[vaudeville]] song-and-dance team.<ref name="Summerfield2008">{{cite book|last=Summerfield|first=Maurice J.|title=Barney Kessel, a jazz legend|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rUQIAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=8 June 2013|date=31 October 2008|publisher=Ashley Mark Publishing|isbn=978-1-872639-69-7|page=43}}</ref> In 1929, when she was three, her family moved to [[San Bernardino, California]], where she made her debut singing professionally on their public radio station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/person/julie-london?filter-options=tv |title=Julie London Profile |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> In 1941, when she was 14, the family moved to [[Hollywood, California]]. Shortly after that, she began appearing in movies. She graduated from the [[Hollywood Professional School]] in 1945.

==Marriages==
In 1947, London married actor [[Jack Webb]] (of ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'' fame). This pairing arose from their common love of [[jazz]].<ref name="Staggs2003">{{cite book|last=Staggs|first=Sam|title=Close-up on Sunset Boulevard: Billy Wilder, Norma Desmond, and the Dark Hollywood Dream|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iEpdlKas2d4C|accessdate=8 June 2013|date=4 February 2003|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4668-3046-2|page=289}}</ref> They had two daughters, Stacy and Lisa Webb. London and Webb divorced in 1954. Daughter Stacy Webb died in a traffic accident in 1996.

In 1959, London married jazz [[composer]] and musician [[Bobby Troup]]; and they remained married until his death, in 1999. They had one daughter, Kelly Troup, who died in 2002, and twin sons, Jody and Reese Troup. Jody Troup died in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/672/000107351/ |title=Julie London |publisher=Nndb.com |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608002890/Julie-London.html |title=Julie London Biography |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> London was also the stepmother of Cynthia and [[Ronne Troup|Ronne]] Troup, Bobby's daughters from his marriage to Cynthia Hare; they are both entertainers.

==Career==

===Singing===
London began singing under the name '''Gayle Peck''' in public in her teens before appearing in a film. She was discovered by [[talent agent]] [[Sue Carol]] (wife of actor [[Alan Ladd]]), while working as an elevator operator. Her early film career, however, did not include any singing roles.

London recorded 32 albums in a career that began in 1955 with a live performance at the 881 Club in Los Angeles.<ref name="McKnight-Trontz1999">{{cite book|last=McKnight-Trontz|first=Jennifer|title=Exotiquarium: Album Art from the Space Age|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SRvQ8odl3RYC|accessdate=8 June 2013|date=30 July 1999|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-20133-3|page=77}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named her the most popular female vocalist for 1955, 1956, and 1957. She was the subject of a 1957 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' cover article in which she was quoted as saying, "It's only a thimbleful of a voice, and I have to use it close to the microphone. But it is a kind of oversmoked voice, and it automatically sounds intimate."<ref name="Inc1957">{{cite book|title=LIFE|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DFQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA74|accessdate=8 June 2013|date=18 February 1957|publisher=Time Inc|page=74|issn=0024-3019}}</ref>

London's debut recordings were for the [[Bethlehem Records]] label. While shopping for a record deal, she recorded four tracks that would later be included on the compilation album ''Bethlehem's Girlfriends'' in 1955. Bobby Troup backed London on the album, for which London recorded the standards "Don't Worry About Me", "[[Motherless Child]]", "[[A Foggy Day]]", and "[[You're Blasé]]".

London's most famous single, "[[Cry Me a River]]", was written by her [[high school|high-school]] classmate [[Arthur Hamilton]] and produced by Troup.<ref name="Cason2004">{{cite book|last=Cason|first=Buzz|title=Living the Rock 'n Roll Dream: The Adventures of Buzz Cason|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jU3Wgm6_JhAC|accessdate=8 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-1-61780-116-7|page=102}}</ref> The recording became a million-seller after its release in December 1955 and also sold on reissue in April 1983 from the attention brought by a [[Mari Wilson]] [[cover version|cover]]. London performed the song in the film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956), and her recording gained later attention in the films ''[[Passion of Mind]]'' (2000) and [[V for Vendetta (film)|''V for Vendetta'']] (2006). The song "[[Yummy Yummy Yummy]]" was featured on the [[HBO]] television series ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'' and appears on its [[soundtrack album]]. London's "Must Be Catchin'" was featured in the 2011 premiere episode of the ABC series ''[[Pan Am (TV series)|Pan Am]]''. Her last recording was "[[My Funny Valentine]]" for the soundtrack of the Burt Reynolds film ''[[Sharky's Machine (film)|Sharky's Machine]]'' (1981).

===Film===

Though primarily remembered as a singer, London also made more than 20 films. Her widely regarded beauty and poise (she was a [[pin-up girl]] prized by [[GI (military)|GI]]s during [[World War II]]) contrasted strongly with her pedestrian appearance and streetwise acting technique (much parodied by impersonators). One of her strongest performances came in ''[[Man of the West]]'' (1958), starring [[Gary Cooper]] and directed by [[Anthony Mann]], in which her character, the film's only woman, is abused and humiliated by an [[outlaw]] [[gang]].<ref name="Loy">{{cite book|last=Loy|first=R. Philip|title=Westerns in a Changing America, 1955-2000|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jqWGl8_OHZIC&pg=PA63|accessdate=8 June 2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8301-3|page=63}}</ref>

===Television===
She performed on many television [[variety show|variety series]] and also in dramatic roles, including guest appearances on ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1968). On May 28, 1964, London and her husband Bobby Troup recorded a one-hour program for Japanese television in Japan.<ref name=TJLTS>{{cite web|url=http://www.julielondon.org/J/The_Julie_London_Show.html|title= The Julie Jones Television Show Videos|publisher= JulieLondon.org| accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> London sang 13 of her classic songs including "Bye Bye Blackbird", "Lonesome Road", and "Cry Me A River".<ref name=TJLTS/>

London remained close with her ex-husband [[Jack Webb]]; in 1972, Webb hired both his ex-wife and her husband, Troup, for key roles in the TV series ''[[Emergency!]]'', in which he served as [[executive producer]]. London played head nurse [[Dixie McCall]], while Troup took the role of [[emergency room|emergency-room]] [[physician]] Dr.&nbsp;[[Joe Early]]. They also appeared in an episode of the Webb-produced series ''[[Adam-12]]'', reprising their roles.

The onscreen camaraderie between London, Troup, [[Randolph Mantooth]], and [[Kevin Tighe]] (who played the paramedics in the series), carried over into real life, as well. They remained close friends long after the series came to a close.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Mantooth,_Randolph/Biography/ |title=Randolph Mantooth Biography |publisher=Starpulse.com |date=1945-09-19 |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref> In an interview, Mantooth claimed London "was not impish nor a diva. She was a soul, kind of mother. She was the kindest person I have ever known. I don't know if it was up to her, but Kevin and I were both kept calm by her personality, when we were shooting in the hospital. Only Bobby Troup knew who she was...she was just like Julie! She made us laugh!"<ref>http://www.julielondon.org/J/13_Randy_Mantooth_Interview.html</ref>

London and Troup appeared as [[panelist]]s on the [[game show]] ''[[Tattletales]]'' several times in the 1970s. In the 1950s, London appeared in an advertisement for [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro cigarettes]] singing the "Marlboro Song" and in 1978 appeared in television advertisements for Rose Milk Skin Care Cream.
