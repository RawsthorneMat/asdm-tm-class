'''Donald Virgil "Don" Bluth''' (born September 13, 1937) is an American [[animator]], [[film director]], producer, writer, [[production designer]], [[video game designer]] and animation instructor who is known for directing animated films including ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' (1982), ''[[An American Tail]]'' (1986), ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' (1988), ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]'' (1989), and ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997), and his involvement in the [[laserdisc]] game ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]''.  He is also known for competing with former employer [[The Walt Disney Company|The Walt Disney Productions]] during the years leading up to the films that would make up the [[Disney Renaissance]]. He is the older sibling of illustrator [[Toby Bluth]].

==Early life and the Disney years==
Bluth was born in El Paso, Texas, the son of Emaline (née Pratt) and Virgil Ronceal Bluth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Don Bluth|url=http://mormonsinbusiness.org/mormon_businessmen/don-bluth|publisher=Mormons in Business|accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> His great-grandfather was [[Helaman Pratt]], an early leader in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). He is of [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Swedish people|Swedish]] and [[Germans|German]] descent.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.wargs.com/political/romney.html| title=The Ancestors of Mitt Romney| author=William Addams Reitwiesner| accessdate=2012-07-24}}</ref>

As a child in El Paso he rode his horse to the town movie theater to watch Disney films; Bluth said later, "then I'd go home and copy every [[Disney comic book]] I could find".<ref name="cardwell19840218">{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9aUfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XdYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1426%2C2440647 | title=Laser disc arcade games could become wave of the future | work=The Gadsden Times | date=1984-02-18 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Cardwell, Lynda | pages=A8}}</ref> At the age of six his family moved to [[Payson, Utah]] where he lived on a family farm. In 1954 at the age of 17 his family moved to [[Santa Monica, California]], where he attended part of his final year of high school before returning to Utah and graduating from [[Springville High School (Utah)|Springville High School]]. Bluth attended [[Brigham Young University]] in Utah for one year and after got a job at [[The Walt Disney Company]]. He started in 1955 as an assistant to [[John Lounsbery]] for ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. In 1957 Bluth left Disney only two years after being hired. Afterwards Bluth spent two and a half years in [[Argentina]] on a [[missionary (LDS Church)|mission]] for the [[LDS Church]]. He returned to the [[United States]] where he opened the Bluth Brothers Theater with his younger brother [[Toby Bluth|Fred]], though he occasionally worked for Disney. 

Bluth returned to college and got a degree in English Literature from Brigham Young University. Bluth returned to the animation business and joined [[Filmation]] in 1967 working on layouts for ''[[The Archies]]'' and other projects. He returned full-time to Disney in 1971 where he worked on ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too]]'', ''[[The Rescuers]]'' and directing animation on ''[[Pete's Dragon]]''. His last involvement with Disney was the 1978 short ''[[The Small One]]'' and ''[[The Wuzzles]]''. Then he made and produced his first 
short, ''[[Banjo the Woodpile Cat]]'' (1979), which takes place in his hometown Payson, Utah during the 1940s as Banjo travels to [[Salt Lake City]] to find the urban world.

==Independent years==

===Early critical success===
On his 42nd birthday in 1979, Bluth, with [[Gary Goldman]], [[John Pomeroy]], and 9 fellow Disney animators, set out to start his own [[List of animation studios|animation studio]], [[Don Bluth Productions]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Don|url=http://donbluthanimation.com/_Don_Bluth_Animation_About_Don.html|publisher=Don Bluth Animation|accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref><ref name="comicsjournal">{{cite news|last=Heintjes|first=Tom|title=Newswatch: Bluth animation firm goes bankrupt|url=http://www.tcj.com/archive-viewer-issue-98/?pid=7634|accessdate=2012-07-30|newspaper=The Comics Journal No. 98|page=19|date=May 1985}}</ref> He drew a few (uncredited) scenes for ''[[The Fox and the Hound (film)|The Fox and the Hound]]'' but left early in production.
Bluth was disheartened with the way the Disney company was run. He wanted to revive the [[Golden Age of American animation|classical animation style]] of the studio's early classics.<ref name="cataroo">{{cite web|last=Cawley|first=John|title=Don Bluth Biography|url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBbio.html|work=The Animated Films of Don Bluth|publisher=Cataroo.com|accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> To this end, his studio, [[Don Bluth Productions]], demonstrated its ability in its first production, a short film titled ''[[Banjo the Woodpile Cat]]'', and this led to work on an animated segment of the live-action film ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'' (1980).

The studio's first feature-length film was ''The Secret of NIMH'' (1982), an adaptation of ''[[Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH]]'', the 1972 [[Newbery Medal]] winner. Bluth employed 160 animators during the production and agreed to the first [[profit sharing]] contract in the animation industry.<ref name="comicsjournal" /> Though a moderate success in the box office, the movie received critical acclaim. Later, with the home video release and cable showings, it became a cult classic.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cawley|first=John|title=The Secret of N.I.M.H.|url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBnimh.html|work=The Animated Films of Don Bluth|publisher=Cataroo.com|accessdate=2012-07-30|quote=The film developed a cult following which only increased with easy access via video and cable showings.}}</ref>  Nevertheless, due to its modest box office take, and an industry wide animation strike, Don Bluth Productions filed for [[bankruptcy]].<ref name="cataroo" />

His next film would have been an animated version of the Norwegian folk tale ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon#Film adaptations|East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'', but was never made when the financial resources were drawn back.<ref>{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=Don Bluth Goes Independent|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.3/articles/beck1.3.html|accessdate=10 August 2012|newspaper=Animation World Magazine|date=June 1996|quote=That failure [of Secret of NIMH] caused Aurora to back out of producing Bluth's next film, East of the Sun, West of the Moon.}}</ref>

In 1983 teaming with Rick Dyer, from [[RDI Video Systems|Advanced Microcomputer Systems]], Bluth, Goldman and Pomeroy started the Bluth Group and created the groundbreaking [[arcade game]] ''[[Dragon's Lair (1983 video game)|Dragon's Lair]]'', which let the player control a [[cartoon]]-animated character on screen (whose adventures were played off a [[laserdisc]]). This was followed in 1984 by ''[[Space Ace]]'', a [[science fiction|science-fiction]] game based on the same technology, but which gave the player a choice of different routes to take through the story. Bluth not only created the animation for ''Space Ace'', but he also supplied the voice of the villain, Borf.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cawley|first=John|title=Space Ace|url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBspace.html|work=The Animated Films of Don Bluth|publisher=Cataroo.com|accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> Work on a ''Dragon's Lair'' sequel was underway when the video arcade business [[North American video game crash of 1983|crashed]]. Bluth's studio was left without a source of income and the Bluth Group filed for bankruptcy on March 1, 1985.<ref name="comicsjournal" /> A sequel called ''[[Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp]]'' was made in 1991, but it was rarely seen in [[video arcade|arcades]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dragon's Lair II|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7648|publisher=The International Arcade Museum|accessdate=10 August 2012|quote=This game ranks a 24 on a scale out of 100 (100 = most often seen, 1=least common) in popularity based on census ownership records.}}</ref>

In 1985 Bluth, Pomeroy and Goldman established, with businessman [[Morris Sullivan]], the [[Sullivan Bluth Studios]]. It initially operated from an animation facility in [[Van Nuys, California]], but later moved to [[Dublin, Ireland]] to take advantage of government investment and incentives. Bluth and his colleagues taught an animation course at Ballyfermot Senior College.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2010-11-19|url=http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/an-animated-irish-invasion/|title=An Animated Irish Invasion|author=Melena Ryzik|work=The New York Times|date=2010-03-03}}</ref>

===Affiliation with Steven Spielberg===
Teaming up with producer [[Steven Spielberg]], Bluth's next project was ''[[An American Tail]]'' (1986), which at the time of its release became the highest grossing non-Disney animated film of all time, grossing $45 million in the United States and over $84 million worldwide.<ref name="americantail">{{cite web|last=Cawley|first=John|title=An American Tail|url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBtail.html|work=The Animated Films of Don Bluth|publisher=Cataroo.com|accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref> The second Spielberg-Bluth collaboration ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' (1988) did even better in theaters and both found a successful life in home video.<ref name="americantail" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Cawley|first=John|title=The Land Before Time|url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html|work=The Animated Films of Don Bluth|publisher=Cataroo.com|accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref>  The main character in ''An American Tail'' (Fievel Mouskewitz) became the mascot for [[Amblimation]] while ''The Land Before Time'' was followed by twelve direct-to-video sequels.

Bluth broke with Spielberg before his next film, ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]'' (1989).  (Bluth was not involved with the Spielberg-produced ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', released in 1991.) Although ''All Dogs Go To Heaven'' had moderate theatrical success, it was highly successful in its release to home video.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cawley|first=John|title=All Dogs Go To Heaven|url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBdogs.html|work=The Animated Films of Don Bluth|publisher=Cataroo.com|accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref> Like ''The Land Before Time'', ''The Secret of NIMH'' and ''An American Tail'', ''All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was followed by a theatrical sequel, a television series, and a Christmas Carol adaptation, none of which Bluth and his studio had involvement with. Through the 1990s, Bluth films such as ''[[Rock-a-Doodle]]'' (1992), ''[[Thumbelina (1994 film)|Thumbelina]]'' (1994), ''[[A Troll in Central Park]]'' (1994), and ''[[The Pebble and the Penguin]]'' (1995) were critical and box office failures.

===Work at Fox Animation Studios===
Bluth scored a hit with ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997), produced at [[Fox Animation Studios]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], which grossed nearly US $140 million worldwide<ref>{{cite web|title=Anastasia (1997)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=anastasia.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref> and gained favorable critical reviews. In his positive review of the movie, critic [[Roger Ebert]] observed that its creators "consciously include[d] the three key ingredients in the big Disney hits: action, romance and music." ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia's]]'' success established [[20th Century Fox]] as a Disney competitor.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Anastasia|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971121/REVIEWS/711210301/1023|accessdate=2012-07-31|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|date=November 21, 1997}}</ref>

Despite the success of ''Anastasia,'' Bluth resumed his string of box-office disappointments with the futuristic space adventure ''[[Titan A.E.]]'' (2000). The movie made less than $37 million worldwide despite an estimated $75 million budget.<ref>{{cite web|title=Titan A.E. (2000)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=titanae.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2012-07-31}}</ref>  In 2000, 20th Century Fox Studios shut down the Fox Animation Studio facility in Phoenix, making ''Titan A.E.'' the last traditionally animated film released by 20th Century Fox in theaters until the release of 2007's ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=20th Century Fox Feature Films (Fox Animation Studios) Animated Theatrical Cartoons (1977-)|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/20th_Century_Fox/Feature_Films/|publisher=The Big Cartoon Database|accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>

==Recent work==
In 2002, Bluth and video game company [[Ubisoft]] developed the [[video game]] ''[[Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the Lair]]'', an attempt to recreate the feel of the original Dragon's Lair LaserDisc game in a more interactive, three-dimensional environment. Reviews were mixed, with critics both praising and panning the controls and storyline. However, the visuals were noteworthy, using groundbreaking [[Cel-shaded animation|cel-shading]] techniques that lent the game a hand-animated feel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the Lair|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/dragons-lair-3d|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> As of 2012,<ref>{{cite news|last=Arrant|first=Chris|title=EXCLUSIVE: Don Bluth Talks About His Return To "Dragon’s Lair"|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/interviews/exclusive-don-bluth-talks-about-his-return-to-dragons-lair.html|accessdate=2012-07-25|newspaper=Cartoon Brew|date=2012-04-05}}</ref> Don Bluth and Gary Goldman are seeking funding for a film version of ''Dragon's Lair''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Kevin|title=Don Bluth trying to make Dragon's Lair movie|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/05/01/don-bluth-trying-to-make-dragons-lair-movie|accessdate=2012-07-25|newspaper=Joystiq|date=2007-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|title=Don Bluth Still Wants to Make a 'Dragon's Lair' Movie|url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2007/04/29/don-bluth-still-wants-to-make-a-dragons-lair-movie/|accessdate=2012-07-25|newspaper=Moviefone|date=2007-04-29}}</ref>

Bluth and Goldman continued to work in video games and were hired to create the in-game cinematics for [[Namco]]'s ''[[I-Ninja]]'', released in 2003.

In 2004, Bluth did the animation for the [[music video]] "[[Mary (song)|Mary]]", by the [[Scissor Sisters]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Paolo|title=Don Bluth animates Scissor Sisters video|url=http://animatedviews.com/2004/don-bluth-animates-scissor-sisters-video/|accessdate=2012-07-25|newspaper=Animated Views|date=2004-10-22}}</ref> The band contacted Bluth after having recalled fond memories of the sequence from ''Xanadu''.

In 2009, Bluth was asked to produce storyboards for, and to direct, the 30-minute Saudi Arabian festival film ''Gift of the Hoopoe''. He ultimately had little say in the animation and content of the film, and asked that he not be credited as the director or producer. Nonetheless, he was credited as the director, possibly to improve the film's sales by attaching his name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gift of the Hoopoe -Recent film of Don Bluth?|url=http://donbluthanimation.com/forum/showthread.php?t=559|accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>

On February 3, 2011, it was announced that Bluth and his game development company [[Square One Studios]] were working with [[Warner Bros.]] Digital Distribution to develop a modern reinterpretation of the 1983 arcade classic ''[[Tapper]]'', titled ''[[Tapper World Tour]]''.

On March 22, 2011, ''Anastasia'' was released to [[Blu-ray Disc]]. The high-charting release and an increase in sales for other Bluth-directed titles, has sparked interest for a return to his as-yet unconfirmed 12th directorial feature.{{Citation needed|reason=Interest from whom?|date=July 2014}}

===As an author===
Bluth has authored a series of books for students of animation: 2004's ''The Art of Storyboard'', and 2005's ''The Art of Animation Drawing''. Additional books are planned.{{Citation needed|reason=What books? Who has said they are planned?|date=July 2014}}

===As an educator===
In early 2009, Bluth launched his website, DonBluthAnimation.com, in which he focuses on animation education through video tutorials, short films and live video seminars.

==As a theatre director==
Bluth currently runs an Adult and Youth Theatre in Arizona, called Don Bluth Front Row Theatre. The theatre group was unique and unusual as productions were presented in the living room of Bluth's Scottsdale, Arizona home.  They now run in a small theater off Shea Blvd in Scottsdale.  <ref>http://www.donbluthfrontrowtheatre.com/</ref>
