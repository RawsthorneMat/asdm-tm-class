Jean-Jacques Annaud was born on 1 October 1943 in [[Juvisy-sur-Orge]], Essonne in France. He was educated at the technical school in Vaugirard, and in 1964 graduated from the prestigious film school Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques (IDHEC) in Paris.

==Career==
Annaud began his career by directing television advertisements in the late 1960s to early 1970s. In his first feature film, ''[[Black and White in Color]]'' from 1976, he used personal experience obtained during his own military service in [[Cameroon]]. The film won an [[Academy Award]] for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref name="Oscars1977">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/49th-winners.html |title=The 49th Academy Awards (1977) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=25 March 2012 |work=oscars.org}}</ref> His third film ''[[Quest for Fire (film)|Quest for Fire]] (La Guerre du feu)'' received two [[César Award|Césars]] for best film and best director.

In 1986, Annaud directed ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'', a film adaptation of [[Umberto Eco]]'s popular [[The Name of the Rose|novel of the same name]]. The film version, with a screenplay written by [[Andrew Birkin]], won two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Film Awards and was the subject of another 14 wins & two nominations. Jean-Jacques Annaud spent four years preparing for the film, traveling throughout the United States as well as Europe, searching for the perfect cast and film set locations. He supposedly felt personally intrigued by the project, among other things because of a lifelong fascination with medieval churches and a great familiarity with Latin and Greek.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

[[Heinrich Harrer]], he reportedly received a [[persona non grata|lifelong denial of entry]] to China, along with starring actors [[Brad Pitt]] and [[David Thewlis]].<ref>Rémi Fournier Lanzoni, ''French cinema: from its beginnings to the present,'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004 p.464 n.7</ref>
