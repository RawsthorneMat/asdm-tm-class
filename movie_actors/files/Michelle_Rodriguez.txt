[[File:Battle Los Angeles cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right, Rodriguez, Jonathan Liebesman and Aaron Eckhart at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International]]
In 2010, Rodriguez appeared in [[Robert Rodriguez]]'s ''[[Machete (film)|Machete]]''. The film received mostly positive reviews and earned $44&nbsp;million at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20844|title=Get Your Grindhouse Fix With a New Poster from Robert Rodriguez's Machete|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}} {{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> In 2011, she appeared with [[Aaron Eckhart]] in the science fiction film ''[[Battle: Los Angeles]]'' which grossed over $200&nbsp;million in the worldwide box office.

In the same year, Rodriguez appeared in Robert Rodriguez's film ''[[Machete Kills]]''.

====Typecast====
After her film debut, ''Girlfight'', Rodriguez has consistently portrayed tough and tomboyish characters who operate in traditional male fields such as the police force or armed forces. Rodriguez says that she does not mind the typecasting, and in fact, is somewhat responsible for it:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodnews.com/2010/07/26/michelle-rodriguez-responds-to-being-typecast-as-the-tough-chick/|publisher=Hollywoodnews.com|date=July 26, 2010|title=Michelle Rodriquez Responds}}</ref>

"Oh man, I was typecast the minute I did a film called ''Girlfight'' years ago. You allow yourself to be typecast. If I decided I didn't want to be typecast tomorrow, I'd just do an indie film where I play some poor girl who goes through some excruciating experience and win myself an award for crying or being raped. But at the end of the day, I'm not in it for the acting. I only wanna be someone I respect or someone that I consider interesting or fun. I'm here to entertain people and make a statement about female empowerment and strength, and that's what I've done for the last 10 years. I pigeonholed myself and I put myself in that box by saying no to everything else that came on my plate. Saying no to this, no to that, and eventually I just got left with the strong chick that's always being killed, and there's nothing wrong with that."

===Screenwriting===
During the promotional tour of ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'' Rodriguez has stated that she originally joined the [[Hollywood]] business to become a screenwriter. She has also stated that she has two screenplays under development and plans to take a break from acting to pursue her writing. One is a family film based on a concept which she describes as "a 2012 story about purity and animals and children",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0569059/ |title=Michelle Rodriguez Writing Kids Film |date=September 18, 2008 |publisher=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> and the other is a revision of an American remake of the 1997 German film ''Bandits'' which she describes as a film "about four girls who break out of jail and get chased across the country by the feds and by this MTV-like representative".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gameculture.com/2009/12/14/gameculture-exclusive-quotavatarquot-vet-michelle-rodriguez-talks-modern-warfare-and-dodg |title=GameCulture Exclusive: 'Avatar' Vet Michelle Rodriguez Talks Modern Warfare and Dodging Earthquakes |date=December 14, 2009 |publisher=Gameculture.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091217033258/http://www.gameculture.com/2009/12/14/gameculture-exclusive-quotavatarquot-vet-michelle-rodriguez-talks-modern-warfare-and-dodg |archivedate=December 17, 2009}}</ref>

I like to mix it up, it's pretty eclectic."

===Notable rankings===
Several times over the course of her career, she has been ranked in ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' magazine's "102 Sexiest Women In The World", ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''{{'s}} "100 Sexiest Women", and ''[[People en Español]]''{{'s}} "50 Más Bellos", and was ranked No. 74 in [[FHM]]'s "100 Sexiest Women in the World 2009".{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
