'''Yasujirō Ozu''' {{nihongo|'''Yasujirō Ozu'''|小津 安二郎|Ozu Yasujirō|12 December 1903 – 12 December 1963}} was a Japanese [[film director]] and [[screenwriter]]. He began his career during the era of [[silent films]]. Ozu made fifty-three films: twenty-six in his first five years as a director, and all but three for the [[Shochiku]] studio. Ozu first made a number of short comedies, before turning to more serious themes in the 1930s.

Marriage and family, especially the relationships between the generations, are among the themes in his work. His outstanding works include ''[[Late Spring]]'' (1949), ''[[Early Summer]]'' (1951), ''[[Tokyo Story]]'' (1953), and ''[[Floating Weeds]]'' (1959). He made great use of [[Ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipsis]], where many events are not depicted visually, and he also used a style of cinematography in which the camera rarely moves and is usually positioned below the eye level of the actors.

His reputation has continued to grow since his death, and he is widely regarded as one of the world's most influential directors.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ozu was born in the Fukagawa district of [[Tokyo]], the second son of five brothers and sisters.<ref group="n">The Japanese name ending "jiro" indicates a second son.</ref> His father was a fertilizer seller. He attended Meiji nursery school and primary school.<ref name="Hasumi-319">{{harvnb|Hasumi|2003|p=319}}</ref> In March 1913, at the age of ten, he and his siblings were sent by his father to live in his father's home town of [[Matsusaka, Mie|Matsusaka]] in [[Mie Prefecture]], where he lived until 1924.<ref name="Hasumi-319"/><ref>{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Weston|title=Giants of Japan|publisher=Kodansha International|year=1999|page=303}}</ref> In March 1916, at the age of 13 he entered what is now Ujiyamada High School.<ref group="n">宇治山田高等学校</ref> He was a boarder at the school and did judo.<ref name="Hasumi-319"/> He frequently skipped school to watch films such as ''Quo Vadis?'' or ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1913 film)|The Last Days of Pompei]]''. In 1917 he saw the film ''[[Civilization (film)|Civilization]]'' and decided that he wanted to be a film director.<ref name="Hasumi-320">{{harvnb|Hasumi|2003|p=320}}</ref>

In 1920, at the age of 17, he was thrown out of the dormitory after being accused of writing a love letter to a good-looking boy in a lower class, and had to commute to school by train.<ref name="Hasumi-320"/>

In March 1921 he graduated from the high school. He attempted the exam for what is now Kobe University's economics department,<ref group="n">神戸高商, Kobe Kosho</ref> but failed. In 1922 he took the exam for a teacher training college,<ref group="n">三重県立師範学校, Mie-ken ritsu shihan gakko</ref> but failed it. On 31 March 1922 he began working as a substitute teacher at a school in Mie prefecture. He is said to have travelled the long journey from the school in the mountains to watch films at the weekend. In December 1922, his family with the exception of Ozu and his sister, moved back to Tokyo to live with his father. In March 1923, when his sister graduated, he also went to Tokyo.

===Entering the film business===

With his uncle acting as intermediary, Ozu entered the [[Shochiku|Shochiku Film Company]] as an assistant in the cinematography department on 1 August 1923, against the wishes of his father.<ref name="Hasumi-320"/> His family home was destroyed in [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|the earthquake of 1923]], but no members of his family were injured.

On 12 December 1924, Ozu started a year of military service.<ref name="Hasumi-320"/><ref group="n">Ozu's military service was of a special type called ''ichinen shiganhei'' (一年志願兵) where the usual two-year term of conscription was shortened to one year on condition that the conscriptee paid for himself.</ref> He finished his military service on 30 November 1925, leaving as a corporal.

In 1926 he became a third [[assistant director]].<ref name="Hasumi-321">{{harvnb|Hasumi|2003|p=321}}</ref> In 1927 he was involved in a fracas where he punched another employee for jumping a queue at the studio cafeteria, and when called to the studio director's office he used it as an opportunity to present a film script he had written.<ref name="Hasumi-321"/> In September 1927 he was promoted to director in the ''[[jidaigeki]]'' (period film) department, and directed his first film, ''[[Sword of Penitence]]'', now lost. Ozu's story was dramatized by [[Kogo Noda]], who would become his co-writer for the rest of his career. On 25 September he was called up to military reserves until November, and the film was partly finished by another director.<ref name="Hasumi-321"/>

In 1928, [[Shiro Kido]], the head of the Shochiku studio, decided that the company was to concentrate on making short comedy films without star actors. Ozu made a series of these films.  The film ''Body Beautiful'', released on 1 December 1928, was the first Ozu film to use his trademark low camera position.<ref name="Hasumi-321"/> After a series of "no star" pictures, in September 1929 Ozu's first film with stars, ''I graduated but...'', starring [[Minoru Takada]] and [[Kinuyo Tanaka]], was released. In January 1930 he was entrusted with Shochiku's top star [[Sumiko Kurishima]] in her new year film, ''An Introduction to Marriage''. His subsequent films of 1930 impressed Shiro Kido enough to invite Ozu on a trip to a hot spring. In his early works Ozu used the pseudonym "James Maki" for his screenwriting.<ref>{{harvnb|Shindo|2004|p=11}}</ref> His film ''Young Miss'', with an all-star cast, was the first time he used the penname James Maki,<ref group="n">ゼェームス槇</ref> and was also his first film to appear in film magazine [[Kinema Jumpo]]'s "Best Ten" at third position.<ref name="Hasumi-322">{{harvnb|Hasumi|2003|p=322}}</ref>

In 1932, his ''[[I Was Born, But...]]'', a comedy with serious overtones on adolescence, was received by movie critics as the first notable work of [[social criticism]] in Japanese cinema, winning Ozu wide acclaim.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=A.O.|title=Revenge on the Bully, Silently, in Japan|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/movies/25iwas.html?_r=0|accessdate=19 May 2015|work=New York Times|agency=New York Times Company|date=24 June 2010}}</ref>

In 1935 Ozu made a short documentary with soundtrack: ''Kagami Shishi'', in which Kokiguro VI performed a [[Kabuki]] dance of the same title. This was made by request of the Ministry of Education.<ref name=richie />{{rp|p. 221}} Like the rest of Japan's cinema industry, Ozu was slow to switch to the production of [[talkie]]s: his first film with a dialogue sound-track was ''[[The Only Son (1936 film)|The Only Son]]'' in 1936, five years after Japan's first talking film, [[Heinosuke Gosho]]'s ''The Neighbor's Wife and Mine''.

===Wartime===

On 9 September 1937, at a time when Shochiku was unhappy about Ozu's lack of box-office success (despite the praise and awards he received from critics), the thirty-four-year-old Ozu was conscripted into the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. He spent two years in [[China]] in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. He arrived in Shanghai on 27 September 1937 as part of an infantry regiment which handled chemical weapons.<ref name="hasumi-327"/> He started as a corporal but was promoted to sergeant on 1 June 1938.<ref name="hasumi-327"/> From January until September 1938 he was stationed in [[Nanjing]], meeting [[Sadao Yamanaka]], who was also stationed nearby. In September, Yamanaka died of illness.<ref name=hasumi-327>{{harvnb|Hasumi|2003|p=327}}</ref> In 1939, Ozu was dispatched to [[Hankou]], where he fought in the [[Battle of Nanchang]] and the [[Battle of Xiushui River]]. In June, he was ordered back to Japan, arriving in Kobe in July, and his conscription ended on 16 July 1939.<ref name="hasumi-327"/>

In 1939, he wrote the first draft of the script for ''[[The Flavor of Green Tea over Rice]]'' but shelved it due to changes insisted on by military censors.<ref name="hasumi-327"/> The first film Ozu made on his return was the critically and commercially successful ''[[Brothers and Sisters of the Toda Family]]'', released in 1941. He followed this with an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] theme: ''Chichi Ariki'' (''[[There Was a Father]]'', 1942), describing the strong bonds of affection between a father and son despite years of separation.

In 1943, Ozu was again drafted into the army to make a [[propaganda]] film in [[Burma]]. However, he was sent to [[Singapore]] instead, to make a film called ''Deruhi e, Deruhi e'' (translation "To Delhi, to Delhi") with [[Subhas Chandra Bose|Chandra Bose]].<ref name="shinario-jinsei">{{kaneto-shindo-shinario-jinsei}}</ref> During his time in Singapore, having little inclination to work, he spent an entire year reading, playing tennis, and watching American films provided by the Army information corps. He was particularly impressed by ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.<ref name="hasumi-329">{{harvnb|Hasumi|2003|p=329}}</ref> He occupied a fifth-floor room facing the sea in the [[Cathay Building]] where he entertained guests, drew pictures and collected carpets. With the end of the Second World War in August 1945, Ozu destroyed the script and footage shot of the film.<ref name="shinario-jinsei"/> He was detained as a civilian and worked in a rubber plantation. Of his film team of 32 people, there was only space for 28 on the first repatriation boat to Japan. Ozu won a lottery giving him a place, but gave it to someone else who was anxious to return.<ref name="shinario-jinsei"/><ref name="hasumi-329"/>

===Postwar===

Ozu returned to Japan in February 1946, and moved back in with his mother, who had been staying with his sister in [[Noda, Chiba|Noda]] in Chiba prefecture. He reported for work at the Ofuna studios on 18 February 1946. His first film released after the war was ''[[The Record of a Tenement Gentleman]]'' in 1947. Around this time, the Chigasakikan<ref group="n">茅ケ崎館</ref> [[Ryokan (Japanese inn)|ryokan]] became Ozu's favoured location for scriptwriting.

[[Tokyo Story]] was the last script written at Chigasakikan. After that, Ozu and Noda used a small house in the mountains at [[Tateshina, Nagano|Tateshina]] in [[Nagano Prefecture]] called Unkosō<ref group="n">雲呼荘</ref> to write scripts, with Ozu staying in a nearby house called Mugeisō.<ref group="n">無芸荘</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shindo|2004|pp=31–32}}</ref>

Ozu's films were most favorably received from the late 1940s, and the so-called "Noriko trilogy" (starring [[Setsuko Hara]]) of ''[[Late Spring]]'', 1949, ''[[Early Summer]]'' and 1951, ''[[Tokyo Story]]'', 1953, has come to be seen as his masterpiece.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Parkinson|first1=David|title=Yasujiro Ozu - The Noriko Trilogy|url=http://www.moviemail.com/scripts/article.pl?articleID=150|website=MovieMail|publisher=MovieMail Ltd|accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref> These three films were followed by ''[[Equinox Flower]]'', 1958, his first film in colour, ''[[Floating Weeds]]'', 1959 and ''[[Late Autumn (1960 film)|Late Autumn]]'', 1960. Ozu often worked with screenwriter [[Kogo Noda]]; other regular collaborators included camera man [[Yuharu Atsuta]] and the actors [[Chishū Ryū]], [[Setsuko Hara]], and [[Haruko Sugimura]].

[[File:Engaku-ji Ozu-Yasujiro's-Grave.jpg|thumb|200 px|Ozu's grave at Engaku-ji]]
His work was only rarely shown overseas before the 1960s. Ozu's last film was ''[[An Autumn Afternoon]]'' in 1962.

He served as president of the [[Directors Guild of Japan]] from 1955 to his death in 1963.<ref name="Nenpyo">{{cite web|url=http://www.dgj.or.jp/about_g/chronology.html|title=Nihon eiga kantoku kyōkai nenpyō|publisher=Nihon eiga kantoku kyōkai|language=Japanese|accessdate=17 August 2010}}</ref>

Ozu was well known for his drinking. He and his screenwriting collaborator Kogo Noda measured the progression of their scripts by how many bottles of [[sake]] they had drunk. Ozu remained single throughout his life and lived with his mother until she died, less than two years before his own death.

Ozu died in 1963 of [[cancer]] on his 60th birthday. The grave he shares with his mother at [[Engaku-ji]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] bears no name—just the character ''[[Mu (negative)|mu]]'' ("nothingness").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easterwood.org/ozu/gravesite/directions2.html|last=Easterwood|first=Kurt |title=Yasujiro Ozu's gravesite in Kita-Kamakura: How to get there (Part Two). |year=2004|accessdate=2009-08-20 }}</ref>

==Legacy and style==
[[File:Setsuko Hara and Yasujiro Ozu in Tokyo Story.jpg|thumb|200 px|Yasujirō Ozu (far right) on location of ''[[Tokyo Story]]'' (1953)]]
Ozu became widely recognized internationally when his films were shown abroad.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Lindsay|last=Anderson|authorlink=Lindsay Anderson|title=Two inches off the ground|date=Winter 1957|journal=Sight & Sound}}</ref> Influential [[monograph]]s by [[Donald Richie]],<ref name=richie>{{cite book|last=Richie|first=Donald|authorlink=Donald Richie|title=Ozu|publisher=[[University of California]] Press|date=July 1977|isbn=0-520-03277-2}}</ref> [[Paul Schrader]],<ref name=shrader>{{cite book|last=Schrader|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Schrader|title=Transcendental Style in Film: Ozu, Bresson, Dreyer|year=1972|isbn=0-306-80335-6}}</ref> and [[David Bordwell]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordwell|first=David|authorlink=David Bordwell|url=https://www.cjspubs.lsa.umich.edu/electronic/facultyseries/list/series/ozu.php|title=Ozu and the Poetics of Cinema|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1988|isbn=0-691-00822-1}}</ref> have ensured a wide appreciation of Ozu's style, aesthetics and themes. 
Ozu was voted the tenth greatest director of all time in the 2002 [[British Film Institute]]'s ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' poll of Critics' top ten directors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/poll/critics-directors.html|title=BFI Sight & Sound Top Ten Poll 2002 - The Critics' Top Ten Directors|date=2 August 2011|accessdate=22 August 2012}}</ref>

Ozu is probably as well known for the technical style and innovation of his films as for the narrative content. The style of his films is most striking in his later films, a style he had not fully developed until his post-war [[talkie]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Miyao|first1=Daisuke|title=The Scene at the Kyoto Inn: Teaching Ozu Yasujiro’s Late Spring|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/exeas/resources/pdf/late-spring.pdf|website=Columbia University In the City of New York|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref> He did not conform to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] conventions.<ref name="Ebert_Masterpieces">Ebert, Roger, [http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/ozu-the-masterpieces-youve-missed "Ozu: The Masterpieces You've Missed"], retrieved June 8, 2014.</ref> Rather than using the typical over-the-shoulder shots in his dialogue scenes, the camera gazes on the actors directly, which has the effect of placing the viewer in the middle of the scene.<ref name="Ebert_Masterpieces"/> Ozu did not use typical transitions between scenes, either. In between scenes he would show shots of certain static objects as transitions, or use direct cuts, rather than fades or dissolves. Most often the static objects would be buildings, where the next indoor scene would take place. It was during these transitions that he would use music, which might begin at the end of one scene, progress through the static transition, and fade into the new scene. He rarely used non-[[Diegesis#In film|diegetic]] music in any scenes other than in the transitions.<ref name="mark schilling">{{cite web|last1=Schilling|first1=Mark|title=Re-examining Yasujiro Ozu on film|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2013/12/07/films/re-examining-yasujiro-ozu-on-film/#.VVuc6_lVhBd|website=Japan Times|accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref> Ozu moved the camera less and less as his career progressed, and ceased using tracking shots altogether in his color films.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Magill|first1=Frank Northen|title=Magill's survey of cinema, foreign language films, Volume 6|date=1985|publisher=Salem Press|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0893562432|page=2542}}</ref>  However, David Bordwell argues that Ozu is one of the few directors to "create a systematic alternative to Hollywood continuity cinema, but he does so by changing only a few premises."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic235120.files/BordwellOzuNewIntro.pdf|last=Bordwell|first=David|authorlink=David Bordwell|title=Konban-wa, Ozu-san}}<!-- needs date and retrieved date --></ref>

He invented the "tatami shot", in which the camera is placed at a low height, supposedly at the eye level of a person kneeling on a ''[[tatami]]'' mat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Ozu: The Masterpieces You've Missed|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/ozu-the-masterpieces-youve-missed|website=Roger Ebert's Film Journal|accessdate=19 May 2015}}</ref> Actually, Ozu's camera is often even lower than that, only one or two feet off the ground. He used this low height even when there were no sitting scenes, such as when his characters walked down hallways.

Ozu eschewed the traditional rules of filmic storytelling, most notably [[Eyeline match|eyelines]]. In his review of ''[[Floating Weeds]]'', film critic [[Roger Ebert]] recounts<blockquote>[Ozu] once had a young assistant who suggested that perhaps he should shoot conversations so that it seemed to the audience that the characters were looking at one another. Ozu agreed to a test. They shot a scene both ways, and compared them. "You see?" Ozu said. "No difference!"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19970330/REVIEWS08/401010319/1023|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Floating Weeds (1959)|accessdate=22 August 2012|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref></blockquote>

In narrative structure, Ozu was an innovator in his use of [[Ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipses]], in which many major events are left out, leaving only the space between them.<ref name="david desser">{{cite book|last1=Desser|first1=David|title=Ozu's Tokyo Story|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge & New York|isbn=0521482046|pages=6-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdi6mX9P9MYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> For example, in ''[[An Autumn Afternoon]]'' a wedding is mentioned in one scene, and then in the next, a reference is made to the wedding that has already occurred. The wedding, however, never occurs on screen. This is typical of Ozu's films. Usually Ozu elides moments that Hollywood films use to stir an emotional reaction from the audience, thus eschewing melodrama.<ref name="david desser" />

==Tributes and documentaries==
In the [[Wim Wenders]] documentary film ''[[Tokyo-Ga]]'', the director travels to Japan to explore the world of Ozu, interviewing both [[Chishū Ryū]] and Yuharu Atsuta.

In 2003, the centenary of Ozu's birth was commemorated at various film festivals around the world. Shochiku produced the film ''[[Café Lumière]]'' (珈琲時光), directed by [[Taiwan]]ese filmmaker [[Hou Hsiao-Hsien]] as homage to Ozu, with direct reference to the late master's ''Tokyo Story'' (1953), to premiere on Ozu's birthday.

John Walker, former editor of ''[[Leslie Halliwell|Halliwell]]`s Film Guide'', placed ''Tokyo Story'' top in a list of the best 1000 films yet made.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Ozu's ''[[Tokyo Story]]'' has appeared several times in the [[Sight & Sound]] poll of best films selected by critics and directors. In 2012, it topped the poll of film directors' choices of "greatest film of all time".

In 2013, director [[Yoji Yamada]] of the [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo]] film series remade [[Tokyo Story]] in a modern setting as [[Tokyo Family]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/tokyo-family|accessdate=14 April 2015|last=Elley|first=Derek|authorlink=Derek Elley|title=Tokyo Family}}</ref>
