'''Andrew Dominik''' (born 7 October 1967) is a New Zealand-born Australian [[film director]] and [[screenwriter]]. He has directed the crime film ''[[Chopper (film)|Chopper]]'', the Western drama film ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' and the neo-noir crime film ''[[Killing Them Softly]]''.

==Early life and career==
Dominik has lived in Australia since he was two years old and graduated from [[Melbourne]]'s [[Swinburne University of Technology|Swinburne Film School]] in 1988.

===''Chopper'' (2000)===
His career in films began in 2000 when he directed ''[[Chopper (film)|Chopper]]'' based on notorious Australian criminal [[Mark Brandon Read|Mark Brandon "Chopper" Read]], starring [[Eric Bana]] and [[Simon Lyndon]].<ref>{{cite news |work=The World Today |title='Chopper' the film to be released next week |first=Lisa |last=McGregor |url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s156517.htm |date=2000-07-27}}</ref> ''Chopper'' received generally positive reviews,<ref>{{cite web |work=Rotten Tomatoes |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chopper/ |title=Chopper}}</ref> and Bana in particular was widely praised for his intense portrayal of Chopper. The [[Australian Film Institute Awards|Australian Film Institute]] awarded the film with Best Director (Dominik), Best Actor (Bana), and Best Supporting Actor (Lyndon).

===''The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford'' (2007)===
His next film was ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'', starring [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Casey Affleck]], based on the [[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (novel)|novel of the same name]] which he came across in a second-hand bookstore.<ref>{{cite interview |url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/the-assassination-of-jesse-james-by-the-coward-robert-ford-andrew-dominik-interviewthe-assassination-of-jesse-james-by-the-coward-robert-ford-andrew-dominik-interview |title=The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford |subject=Andrew Dominik |work=Your London Reviews |publisher=IndieLondon |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> The film explores the peculiar relationship between [[Jesse James]] and his eventual assassin [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Robert Ford]]. Pitt was a big fan of Dominik's first feature ''Chopper'', and had hoped to collaborate with the filmmaker in the future, especially when Pitt had the chance to work with ''Chopper'' star Eric Bana in ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]''. Pitt contacted the director, and with a big star interested to lead his new film, Dominik was therefore able to get [[Warner Bros.]] to finance the production.

Principal shooting in Canada was completed in 2005, though ''The Assassination'''s 2006 release was delayed to a fall 2007 release, largely due to studio interference with the film's editing process.<ref name="tol">{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Salisbury |work=Time Out London |title=Andrew Dominik: interview |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/features/show-feature/3798/andrew-dominik-interview.html |date=November 2007}}</ref> Dominik and Pitt were pulling for a less quick-paced and more contemplative cut of the film while the studio wanted "less contemplation and more action". There were reportedly more than a dozen edited versions of the film at one time fighting to be the final cut, the longest version being over four hours.<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Andrew Dominik |url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/8838 |interviewer=Charlie Rose |title=Charlie Rose |publisher=charlierose.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> The disputes during post-production lasted for over a year before a final version was settled upon. Over an hour of scenes were deleted for the theatrical version, but Dominik remarked he was still very proud of the theatrical version of the film.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/day-and-night/the-big-interview-andrew-dominik-the-assassination-of-jesse-james-1233098.html | work=Irish Independent | first=Paul | last=Whitington | title=The Big Interview: Andrew Dominik, 'The Assassination of Jesse James' | date=2007-11-30}}</ref> The film garnered two [[Academy Award]] nominations: Best Cinematography ([[Roger Deakins|Deakins]]) and Best Supporting Actor (Affleck).

===''Killing Them Softly'' (2012)===
Dominik reteamed with [[Brad Pitt]] in their second collaboration (after ''The Assassination of Jesse James'') in a thriller/dark comedy based on [[George V. Higgins]]' Boston-set crime novel ''[[Cogan's Trade]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Panasiewicz, Kevin |url=http://www.collider.com/2010/11/02/andrew-dominik-casey-affleck-cogans-trade/ | work=Collider | title=Andrew Dominik and Casey Affleck Possibly Reteaming for COGAN’S TRADE | date=2010-11-02}}</ref> The film was renamed ''[[Killing Them Softly]]''. Shooting began in January 2011 and wrapped in May 2011.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://artsandentertainmentplayground.com/2011/05/05/brad-pitts-%E2%80%98cogan%E2%80%99s-trade%E2%80%99-is-in-the-can/ |author=Mike Stringer |work=A&E Playground | title=Brad Pitt’s ‘Cogan’s Trade’ is in the Can |date=2011-05-05 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref> The film competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="Official Selection">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/58878.html |title=2012 Official Selection |accessdate=2012-05-19 |work=Cannes |date=2012-05-05 }}</ref><ref name="timeout">{{cite web |author=Dave Calhoun |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2547/cannes-film-festival-2012-line-up-announced |title=Cannes Film Festival 2012 line-up announced |accessdate=2012-04-19 |work=Timeout}}</ref> and was released through the [[Weinstein Company]].

===Previously attached projects===
In 2003, [[Paramount Pictures]] approached Dominik and offered him to direct an adaptation of [[Alfred Bester]]'s 1953 novel ''[[The Demolished Man]]'', but as time passed, the project eventually became stuck in [[development hell]] when there were disagreements with the screenplay.<ref>http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4887527-1.html Dominik Hits 'demolished' At Paramount {{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/webexclusives/2007/09/last-man-standing-by-nick-dawson.php |title=Last Man Standing |publisher=Filmmaker Magazine |date=September 2007 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>

Dominik had also written an adapted screenplay for ''[[The Killer Inside Me]]'', an acclaimed noir novel by [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]], and was at one point considered to direct it, but dropped out.<ref>{{cite web |author='Stax' |publisher=Movies.ign.com |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/446/446681p1.html |title=The Stax Report: Script Review of The Killer Inside Me  |date=2003-12-18 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref> [[Michael Winterbottom]] eventually directed the [[The Killer Inside Me (2010 film)|film]].
