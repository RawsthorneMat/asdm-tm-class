He studied briefly at the Economy and Trade faculty of the local university, before leaving to study at the [[Piccolo Teatro di Milano]].

==Acting career==
Nero's first film role was a small part in ''La ragazza in prestito'' (1964), and he had his first lead role in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'' (1966) a [[spaghetti western]] and one of his best known films. In 1966 from ''Django'' he went on to appear in eight more films released that year including ''[[Texas, Adios|Texas, addio]]'' (1967) and ''[[Tempo di massacro]]''.

In 1967, he appeared in ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' as [[Lancelot]], where he met his long time romantic partner, and later on in life his wife, [[Vanessa Redgrave]]. Following this he appeared in the [[mafia]] film  ''[[Il giorno della civetta (film)|Il giorno della civetta]]'' opposite [[Claudia Cardinale]] released in 1968.

A lack of proficiency in English tended to limit these roles, although he also appeared in other English language films including ''[[The Virgin and the Gypsy (film)|The Virgin and the Gypsy]]'' (1970), ''[[Force 10 from Navarone (film)|Force 10 from Navarone]]'' (1978), ''[[Enter the Ninja]]'' (1981) and ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' (1990).

Although often typecast in films like ''[[Los amigos]]'' (1972) or ''[[Keoma (film)|Keoma]]'' (1976) he has attempted an impressive range of characters, such as [[Abel]] in [[John Huston]]'s epic ''[[The Bible: In The Beginning]]'' (1966), the humiliated engineer out for revenge in ''[[Street Law (film)|Street Law]]'', the gay lieutenant in ''[[Querelle]]'' (1982) and [[Cinema of Serbia|Serbian]] mediaeval hero in ''[[Banović Strahinja (film)|Banović Strahinja]]'' (1983). He has appeared in over 150 films, and has written, produced and starred in one: ''[[Jonathan degli orsi]]'' (1993).<ref>[http://www.1kult.com/2010/02/12/linterview-exclusive-de-franco-nero/ Franco Nero Interview from 1Kult.com] (English subtitled)</ref>

More recently, he starred in Hungarian director {{ill|hu|Koltay Gábor}}'s ''[[The Conquest (1996 film)|Honfoglalás (Conquest)]]'' in 1996, in ''[[Li chiamarono... briganti!]]'' (1999) by [[Pasquale Squitieri]] and subsequently in Koltay's ''Sacra Corona (Holy Crown)'' in 2001.

In 2009 he played an eccentric author called "Mario Puzzo" in ''[[Mord ist mein Geschäft, Liebling]]'' ("Murder is my trade, darling", Italian title "Tesoro, sono un killer"). German critics found his performance was the best part of the film: "Having Franco Nero playing in this film is really a great joy - it is only regrettable that after his appearances there is still so much film left."<ref>"Dass Franco Nero in diesem Film mitspielt, macht wirklich großen Spaß – schade nur, dass nach seinen Auftritten noch so viel Film übrig ist." {{Cite news|url= http://www.filmzentrale.com/rezis2/mordistmeingeschaeftlieblingob.htm|last=Oliver Baumgarten|title= Mord ist mein Geschäft, liebling| newspaper=Filmzentrale| accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref>

In 2010, Nero appeared in the film ''[[Letters to Juliet]]'' with Redgrave. In 2011 he appeared as a guest star on the season 13 premiere episode of [[Law and Order SVU]]. His character, though Italian, was based on [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]]. In the same year, he received a star on the [[Italian Walk of Fame]] in [[Toronto, Canada]].<ref>Yuen, Jenny. [http://www.torontosun.com/2011/09/05/italian-walk-of-fame-honours-stars "Italian Walk of Fame honours stars"]</ref>

In 2012, Nero made a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Django Unchained]]'' in one scene alongside [[Jamie Foxx]], who plays Django in the film. In the scene Nero plays an Italian Mandingo Fighter manager. Nero then questions Foxx about his character's name and asks him to spell it. This references Nero's role as Django in the original ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'' film.

==Personal life==
His romantic involvement with British actress [[Vanessa Redgrave]] began in 1967 when they met on the set of ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]''. In 1969, they had a son, [[Carlo Gabriel Nero|Carlo Gabriel Redgrave Sparanero]] (known professionally as [[Carlo Gabriel Nero]]), a screenwriter and director. After separating for many years, during which they both had relationships with other people, they reunited and married on 31 December 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/7817915/Vanessa-Redgrave-speaks-about-marriage-to-second-husband-for-the-first-time.html |title=Vanessa Redgrave speaks about marriage to second 'husband' for the first time |publisher=Telegraph |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref> Carlo Nero directed Redgrave in the cinematic adaptation of [[Wallace Shawn]]'s play ''The Fever''.

Nero walked his future stepdaughter [[Natasha Richardson]] down the aisle when she married actor [[Liam Neeson]] in 1994. Her father, [[Tony Richardson]], had died in 1991.
