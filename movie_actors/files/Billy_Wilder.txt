'''Billy Wilder''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|aɪ|l|d|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈvɪldɐ|lang}}; June 22, 1906<ref>{{cite web |title=Billy Wilder Biography |url=http://www.biography.com/people/billy-wilder-9531169 |work=[[Biography.com]] |date=2015 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}</ref>{{spaced ndash}}March 27, 2002) was an Austrian-born American filmmaker, screenwriter, producer, artist and journalist, whose career spanned more than 50 years and 60 films. He is regarded as one of the most brilliant and versatile filmmakers of Hollywood's golden age. Wilder is one of only five people to have won Academy Awards as producer, director and screenwriter for the same film (''[[The Apartment]]''), and was the first person to accomplish this.<ref>{{cite web |title=Oscar Firsts and other Trivia |url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/statistics/Gen-Trivia.pdf |format=PDF |work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |date=February 2015 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}</ref>

Wilder became a screenwriter in the late 1920s while living in [[Berlin]]. After the rise of the [[Nazi Party]], Wilder, who was [[Jew]]ish, left for [[Paris]], where he made his directorial debut. He moved to [[Hollywood]] in 1933, and in 1939 he had a hit when he co-wrote the screenplay for the screwball comedy ''[[Ninotchka]]''. Wilder established his directorial reputation with ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944), a ''[[film noir]]'' he co-wrote with crime novelist [[Raymond Chandler]]. Wilder earned the [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] [[Academy Awards]] for the adaptation of a [[Charles R. Jackson]] story ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), about alcoholism. In 1950, Wilder co-wrote and directed the critically acclaimed ''[[Sunset Blvd. (film)|Sunset Blvd.]]''

From the mid-1950s on, Wilder made mostly comedies.<ref name="DavidCookhis">{{cite book|author=Cook, David A.|title=A History of Narrative: Film Fourth Edition|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=2004|isbn=0-393-97868-0}}</ref> Among the classics Wilder created in this period are the farces ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1955) and ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), satires such as ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), and the drama comedy ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954). He directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances. Wilder was recognized with the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) Life Achievement Award in 1986. In 1988, Wilder was awarded the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]]. In 1993, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].

==Life and career==

===Austria and Germany===
Born '''Samuel Wilder''' to a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Sucha Beskidzka]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (it was the part of Poland that had been subjugated to the Austria-Hungary empire following the eighteenth-century partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and after the end of WWI [[Poland]] again) to Max and Eugenia (née Dittler) Wilder, he was nicknamed Billie by his mother (he changed that to "Billy" after arriving in America). He had an elder brother, [[W. Lee Wilder|William Lee Wilder]] (1904–1982), who also became a screenwriter, film producer and director. His parents had a successful and well-known cake shop in Sucha Beskidzka's train station and unsuccessfully tried to persuade their son to join the family business. Soon the family moved to [[Vienna]], where Wilder attended school. Instead of attending the [[University of Vienna]] Wilder became a journalist. To advance his career Wilder decided to move to [[Berlin]], where, before achieving success as a writer, he allegedly worked as a [[taxi dancer]].<ref>Philips, Alastair. ''City of Darkness, City of Light: Emigre Filmmakers in Paris, 1929–1939.'' Amsterdam University Press, 2004. p. 190.</ref><ref>Silvester, Christopher. ''The Grove Book of Hollywood.'' Grove Press, 2002. p. 311</ref>

After writing crime and sports stories as a [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for local newspapers, he was eventually offered a regular job at a Berlin [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]. Developing an interest in film, he began working as a screenwriter. He collaborated with several other tyros (with [[Fred Zinnemann]] and [[Robert Siodmak]] on the 1929 feature ''[[Menschen am Sonntag|People on Sunday]]''). He wrote the screenplay for the 1931 film adaptation of a novel by [[Erich Kästner]], ''[[Emil and the Detectives (1931 film)|Emil and the Detectives]]''. After the [[rise of Adolf Hitler]], Wilder, a [[Jew]], left for Paris, where he made his directorial debut with the 1934 film ''[[Mauvaise Graine]]''. He relocated to Hollywood prior to its release. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Wilder's mother, grandmother and stepfather all perished in the [[Holocaust]]. For decades it was assumed that it happened at Auschwitz, but while researching Polish and Israeli archives, his Austrian biographer Andreas Hutter discovered in 2011 that they were murdered at different and disparate places: his mother, Eugenia "Gitla" Siedlisker - in 1943 at [[Plaszow concentration camp|Plaszow]]; his stepfather, Bernard "Berl" Siedlisker, in 1942 at [[Belzec concentration camp|Belzec]] and his grandmother, Balbina Baldinger, died in 1943 in the ghetto in [[Nowy Targ]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/feuilleton/film/gitla-stand-nicht-auf-schindlers-liste-1.12844017|title=Gitla stand nicht auf Schindlers Liste|author=Andreas Hutter and Heinz Peters|date=October 6, 2011|publisher=[[Neue Zuercher Zeitung]]|language=German}}</ref>

===Hollywood career===
After arriving in [[Hollywood]] in 1933, Wilder continued his career as a screenwriter. He became a [[naturalized]] citizen of the United States in 1934. Wilder's first significant success was ''[[Ninotchka]]'' in 1939, a collaboration with fellow German immigrant [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. This [[screwball comedy]] starred [[Greta Garbo]] (generally known as a [[tragedy|tragic]] heroine in film [[melodrama]]s), and was popularly and critically acclaimed. With the byline, "Garbo Laughs!", it also took Garbo's career in a new direction. The film also marked Wilder's first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, which he shared with co-writer [[Charles Brackett]] (although their collaboration on ''[[Bluebeard's Eighth Wife]]'' and ''[[Midnight (1939 film)|Midnight]]'' had been well received). For twelve years Wilder co-wrote many of his films with Brackett, from 1938 through 1950. He followed ''Ninotchka'' with a series of box office hits in 1942, including his ''[[Hold Back the Dawn]]'' and ''[[Ball of Fire]]'', as well as his directorial feature debut, ''[[The Major and the Minor]]''.

[[File:Gloria Swanson & Billy Wilder - ca. 1950.JPG|thumb|With [[Gloria Swanson]] during filming of ''Sunset Blvd.'']]
His third film as director, ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' (1944) was a major hit. A ''[[film noir]]'', nominated for Best Director and Screenplay, it was co-written with mystery novelist [[Raymond Chandler]], although the two men did not get along. ''Double Indemnity'' not only set conventions for the ''noir'' genre (such as "venetian blind" lighting and voice-over narration), but was also a landmark in the battle against Hollywood censorship. The original [[James M. Cain]] novel ''Double Indemnity'' featured two love triangles and a murder plotted for insurance money. While the book was highly popular with the reading public, it had been considered unfilmable under the [[Hays Code]], because adultery was central to its plot. ''Double Indemnity'' is credited by some as the first true film noir, combining the stylistic elements of ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' with the narrative elements of ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941).

During the liberation of concentration camps in 1945, the [[Psychological Warfare Department]] (PWD) of the United States Department of War produced an American propaganda documentary film directed by Billy Wilder. The film known as ''[[Death Mills]]'', or [[:de:Die Todesmühlen|''Die Todesmühlen'']], was intended for German audiences to educate them about the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. For the German version, Die Todesmühlen, Hanuš Burger is credited as the writer and director, while Wilder supervised the editing. Wilder is credited with the English-language version. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Two years later, Wilder earned the [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] [[Academy Awards]] for the adaptation of a [[Charles R. Jackson]] story ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' (1945), the first major American film to make a serious examination of alcoholism, another difficult theme under the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]. In 1950, Wilder co-wrote and directed the dark and cynical ''[[Sunset Blvd. (film)|Sunset Blvd.]]'', which paired rising star [[William Holden]] with [[Gloria Swanson]]. Swanson played Norma Desmond, a reclusive silent film star who, with delusions of her greatness from a bygone era, dreams of a [[wikt:comeback|comeback]]. Holden portrays an aspiring screenwriter who can't make ends meet and becomes a [[kept man]] to her. It was critically acclaimed. In 1951, Wilder followed ''Sunset Blvd.'' with ''[[Ace in the Hole (film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Big Carnival''), a tale of media exploitation of a caving accident. The idea for the film was pitched over the phone to Wilder's secretary by Victor Desny. Desny successfully sued Wilder for breach of an implied contract in the influential California copyright case Wilder v Desny.<ref>46 Cal.2d 715, 299 P.2d 257, CAL. 1956.</ref> Although a critical and commercial failure at the time, its reputation has grown over the years.

In the fifties, Wilder also directed two adaptations of Broadway plays, the prisoner of war drama ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), which resulted in a Best Actor Oscar for [[William Holden]], and the [[Agatha Christie]] mystery ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'' (1957). In the mid-1950s, Wilder became interested in doing a film with one of the classic slapstick comedy acts of the Hollywood Golden Age. He first considered, and rejected, a project to star [[Laurel and Hardy]]. He then held discussions with [[Groucho Marx]] concerning a new [[Marx Brothers]] comedy, tentatively titled "A Day at the U.N." This project was abandoned when [[Chico Marx]] died in 1961.<ref name="Gore">Gore, Chris (1999). ''The Fifty Greatest Movies Never Made'', New York: St. Martin's Griffin</ref>

From the mid-1950s onwards, Wilder made mostly comedies.<ref name="DavidCookhis"/> Among the classics Wilder created in this period are the farces ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' (1955) and ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), satires such as ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960), and the romantic comedy ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954). Wilder's humor is sometimes sardonic. In ''[[Love in the Afternoon (1957 film)|Love in the Afternoon]]'' (1957), a young and innocent [[Audrey Hepburn]] does not wish to be young or innocent with playboy [[Gary Cooper]], and pretends to be a married woman in search of extramarital amusement. The film was Wilder's first collaboration with writer-producer [[I. A. L. Diamond]], an association that continued until the end of both men's careers.

In 1959, United Artists released Wilder's Prohibition-era farce ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' without a [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] seal of approval, withheld due to the film's unabashed sexual comedy, including a central cross-dressing theme. [[Jack Lemmon]] and [[Tony Curtis]] play musicians who disguise themselves as women to escape pursuit by a Chicago gang. Curtis's character courts a singer played by [[Marilyn Monroe]], while Lemmon is wooed by [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]]—setting up the film's final joke in which Lemmon reveals that his character is a man and Brown blandly replies "Well, nobody's perfect".

After winning three [[Academy Awards]] for 1960's ''[[The Apartment]]'' (for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay), Wilder's career slowed. His [[Cold War]] farce ''[[One, Two, Three]]'' (1961) featured a rousing comic performance by [[James Cagney]]. It was followed by apparently lesser films that now are of cult status, such as ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and ''[[Kiss Me, Stupid]]''. Wilder gained his last Oscar nomination for his screenplay ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (UK: ''Meet Whiplash Willie'') (1966). His 1970 film ''[[The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]]'' was intended as a major [[roadshow]] release, but was heavily cut by the studio and has never been fully restored. Later films such as ''[[Fedora (film)|Fedora]]'' (1978) and ''[[Buddy Buddy]]'' (1981) failed to impress critics or the public.
After that Wilder complained, futilely, that he was being discriminated against, due to his age. For whatever reason, the studios were unwilling to hire him. One "consolation" which Wilder had in his later years, besides his art collection (see "Later Life," below), was the Andrew Lloyd Webber [[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|stage musical]] version of ''Sunset Blvd.''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Directorial style===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Billy Wilder.jpg|thumb]] -->
Wilder's directorial choices reflected his belief in the primacy of writing. He avoided, especially in the second half of his career, the exuberant cinematography of [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Orson Welles]] because, in Wilder's opinion, shots that called attention to themselves would distract the audience from the story. Wilder's pictures have tight plotting and memorable dialogue. Despite his conservative directorial style, his subject matter often pushed the boundaries of mainstream entertainment. Once a subject was chosen, he would begin to visualize in terms of specific artists. His belief was that no matter how talented the actor, none were without limitations and the end result would be better if you bent the script to their personality rather than force a performance beyond their limitations.<ref>"One Head Is Better than Two," in Films and Filming (London), February 1957.</ref> Wilder was skilled at working with actors, coaxing [[silent film|silent era]] legends [[Gloria Swanson]] and [[Erich von Stroheim]] out of retirement for roles in ''[[Sunset Blvd. (film)|Sunset Blvd.]]''

For ''[[Stalag 17]]'', Wilder squeezed an Oscar-winning performance out of a reluctant [[William Holden]] (Holden had wanted to make his character more likeable; Wilder refused). Wilder sometimes cast against type for major parts such as [[Fred MacMurray]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[The Apartment]]''. MacMurray had become Hollywood's highest-paid actor portraying a decent, thoughtful character in light comedies, melodramas, and musicals; Wilder cast him as a womanizing schemer. [[Humphrey Bogart]] shed his tough-guy image to give one of his warmest performances in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]''. [[James Cagney]], not usually known for comedy, was memorable in a high-octane comic role for Wilder's ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. Wilder coaxed a very effective performance out of [[Marilyn Monroe]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In total, he directed fourteen different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', [[Ray Milland]] in ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'', [[William Holden]] in ''[[Sunset Blvd. (film)|Sunset Blvd.]]'' and ''[[Stalag 17]]'', [[Gloria Swanson]] in ''[[Sunset Blvd. (film)|Sunset Blvd.]]'', [[Erich von Stroheim]] in ''[[Sunset Blvd. (film)|Sunset Blvd.]]'', [[Nancy Olson]] in ''[[Sunset Blvd. (film)|Sunset Blvd.]]'', [[Robert Strauss (actor)|Robert Strauss]] in ''[[Stalag 17]]'', [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'', [[Charles Laughton]] in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', [[Elsa Lanchester]] in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' and ''[[The Apartment]]'', [[Jack Kruschen]] in ''[[The Apartment]]'', [[Shirley MacLaine]] in ''[[The Apartment]]'' and ''[[Irma la Douce]]'' and [[Walter Matthau]] in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]''. Milland, Holden and Matthau won Oscars for their performances in Wilder films. Wilder mentored [[Jack Lemmon]] and was the first director to pair him with Walter Matthau, in ''[[The Fortune Cookie]]'' (1966). Wilder had great respect for Lemmon, calling him the hardest working actor he had ever met. Lemmon starred in seven of Wilder's films.

Wilder's work has had to meet some critical challenges. Although he is admired by many critics and filmgoers, he has not won approval from noted critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], author of ''A Biographical Dictionary of Film'', and other works. Thomson summarizes his attitude toward Wilder by saying, "I remain skeptical."<ref>David Thomson ''A Biographical Dictionary of Film'', London: Little, Brown, 2002, p.936</ref> Thomson emphasizes that, although Wilder created some brilliant films, he also directed some poor ones, especially at the end of his career. Thomson notes that critic [[Andrew Sarris]] did not approve of Wilder for a long time but then changed his attitude much later.<ref>Andrew Sarris, in ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968'' (Da Capo, 1996 [originally published in 1968], p.166) commented that Wilder is too "cynical to believe even his own cynicism" and referred to the "superficial nastiness of his personality". ''"You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet": The American Talking Film, History and Memory, 1927–1949'' (1998) contains Sarris's revised opinion.</ref>

Some{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} say that Wilder's films often lacked any discernible political tone or sympathies, which was not unintentional. He was less interested in current political fashions than in human nature and the issues that confronted ordinary people. He was not affected by the Hollywood blacklist, and had little sympathy for those who were.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Of the blacklisted '[[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]]' Wilder famously quipped, "Of the ten, two had talent, and the rest were just unfriendly". In general, Wilder had an intense dislike for formula and genre films.<ref>Morris Dickstein, Spring 1988 "Sunset Boulevard" ''Grand Street'' Vol. 7 No. 3 p. 180</ref>

Others say that his films derive their parodies from the politics of the world around him, capitalist and Communist, and that Wilder opposed the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). He co-created the “Committee for the First Amendment”, of 500 Hollywood personalities and stars to “support those professionals called upon to testify before the HUAC who had classified themselves as hostile with regard to the interrogations and the interrogators”. Some anti-Communists wanted those in the cinema industry to take oaths of allegiance. The Screen Directors Guild had a vote by show of hands. Only John Huston and Wilder opposed. Huston said, “I am sure it was one of the bravest things that Billy, as a naturalized German, had ever done. There were 150 to 200 directors at this meeting, and here Billy and I sat alone with our hands raised in protest against the loyalty oath”.<ref>[http://www.unav.es/fcom/comunicacionysociedad/es/articulo.php?art_id=408 Filming History: Billy Wilder and the Cold War], José-Vidal PELAZ LÓPEZ, Communication & Society, 25(1), pp.113-136. (2012).</ref>

Wilder reveled in poking fun at those who took politics too seriously. In ''Ball of Fire'', his [[American burlesque|burlesque]] queen 'Sugarpuss' points at her sore throat and complains "Pink? It's as red as the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' and twice as sore." Later, she gives the overbearing and unsmiling [[maid|housemaid]] the name "[[Francisco Franco|Franco]]". Wilder is sometimes confused with director [[William Wyler]]; the confusion is understandable, as both were German-speaking [[Jew]]s with similar backgrounds and names. However, their output as directors was quite different, with Wyler preferring to direct epics and heavy dramas and Wilder noted for his comedies and [[film noir]] type dramas.

===Later life===
Wilder was recognized with the [[American Film Institute|AFI]] Life Achievement Award in 1986. In 1988, Wilder was awarded the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]]. In 1993, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]]. He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Wilder became well known for owning one of the finest and most extensive art collections in Hollywood, mainly collecting modern art. As he described it in the mid 80s, "It's a sickness. I don't know how to stop myself. Call it bulimia if you want – or curiosity or passion. I have some Impressionists, some Picassos from every period, some mobiles by Calder. I also collect tiny Japanese trees, glass paperweights and Chinese vases. Name an object and I collect it."<ref>On Sunset Boulevard – the Life and Times of Billy Wilder, Ed Sikov, “ In Turnaround", pg. 582.</ref> Wilder's artistic ambitions led him to create a series of works all his own. By the early 90s, Wilder had amassed a beguiling assortment of plastic-artistic constructions, many of which were made in collaboration with artist Bruce Houston. In 1993, art dealer Louis Stern, a longtime friend, helped organize an exhibition of Wilder's work at his Beverly Hills gallery. The exhibition was titled ''Billy Wilder's Marché aux Puces'' and the ''Variations on the Theme of Queen Nefertete'' segment was an unqualified crowd pleaser. This series featured busts of the ravishing Egyptian queen wrapped ''a la [[Christo]]'' or splattered ''a la [[Jackson Pollock]]'' or sporting a Campbell's soup can in homage to [[Warhol]].<ref>Nobody's Perfect, Billy Wilder – A Personal Biography, Charlotte Chandler, "Nefertete", pg. 317.</ref>

==Personal life==
Wilder married Judith Coppicus on December 22, 1936. The couple had twins, Victoria and Vincent (born 1939), but Vincent died shortly after birth. They divorced in 1946.

Wilder met Audrey Young at [[Paramount Pictures]] on the set of ''[[The Lost Weekend (film)|The Lost Weekend]]'' in 1945 and she became his second wife on June 30, 1949.

==Death==
Wilder died in 2002 of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 95 after battling health problems,<ref>{{cite news

[[Marilyn Monroe]]'s crypt is located in the same cemetery. Wilder died the same day as two other comedy legends: [[Milton Berle]] and [[Dudley Moore]]. The next day, French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' titled its first-page obituary, "Billy Wilder dies. Nobody's perfect", quoting the final gag line in ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''.

===Legacy===
[[Image:Billy Wilders grave (978339409).jpg|thumb|Wilder's gravestone]]
Wilder holds a significant place in the history of Hollywood censorship for expanding the range of acceptable subject matter. He is responsible for two of the film noir era's most definitive films in ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'' and ''[[Sunset Blvd. (film)|Sunset Blvd.]]'' Along with [[Woody Allen]] and the [[Marx Brothers]], he leads the list of films on the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|American Film Institute's list of 100 funniest American films]] with 5 films written and holds the honor of holding the top spot with ''[[Some Like it Hot]]''. Also on the list are ''[[The Apartment]]'' and ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'' which he directed, and ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' and ''[[Ninotchka]]'' which he co-wrote. The [[American Film Institute]] has ranked four of Wilder's films among their [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|top 100 American films of the 20th century]]: ''Sunset Blvd.'' (no. 12), ''Some Like It Hot'' (no. 14), ''Double Indemnity'' (no. 38) and ''The Apartment'' (no. 93). For the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|tenth anniversary edition of their list]], the AFI moved ''Sunset Blvd.'' to No. 16, ''Some Like it Hot'' to No. 22, ''Double Indemnity'' to No. 29 and ''The Apartment'' to No. 80.

Spanish filmmaker [[Fernando Trueba]] said in his acceptance speech for the 1993 Best Non-English Speaking Film [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]: "I would like to believe in God in order to thank him. But I just believe in Billy Wilder... so, thank you Mr. Wilder." According to Trueba, Wilder called him the day after and told him: "Fernando, it's God." French filmmaker [[Michel Hazanavicius]] also thanked Billy Wilder in the 2012 Best Picture [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] acceptance speech for ''[[The Artist (film)|The Artist]]'' by saying "I would like to thank the following three people, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, I would like to thank Billy Wilder, and I would like to thank Billy Wilder." Wilder's 12 [[Academy Award]] nominations for screenwriting were a record until 1997 when [[Woody Allen]] received a 13th nomination for ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]''.
