'''Sergei Mikhailovich Eisenstein''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|z|ən|ˌ|s|t|aɪ|n}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eisenstein "Eisenstein"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{lang-rus|Сергей Михайлович Эйзенштейн|p=sʲɪrˈɡʲej mʲɪˈxajləvʲɪtɕ ɪjzʲɪnˈʂtʲejn}}; 22 January 1898 – 11 February 1948) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Russian people|Russian]] [[film director]] and [[Film theory|film theorist]], a pioneer in the theory and practice of montage. He is noted in particular for his [[silent film]]s ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925), ''[[Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) and ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'' (1928), as well as the [[Historical movie|historical]] [[Epic film|epics]] ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' (1938) and ''[[Ivan the Terrible (film)|Ivan the Terrible]]'' (1944, 1958).

==Life and career==

===Early years===
[[File:Mikhail-einsenstein-0713-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Young Sergei with his parents Mikhail and Julia Eisenstein.|left]]

Eisenstein was born to a middle-class family in [[Riga]], Latvia (then part of the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Governorate of Livonia]]) but his family moved frequently in his early years, as Eisenstein continued to do throughout his life. His father, [[Mikhail Eisenstein|Mikhail Osipovich Eisenstein]] was born to a [[Germans|German]] [[Jew]]ish father, Osip Eisenstein and a mother of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] descent,<ref>"Almost nothing is known of his paternal grandparents, though the wife of his cousin once remarked that her husband mentioned that the grandmother was thought to be Swedish." in [http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/bergan-eisenstein.html&OQ=_rQ3D1&OP=43e93e1bQ2F0Q2BZQ2F0rS_J3SSu0Q2FSSQ5EJ05K3Ju0Q2F0Q2FZ3Q5BQ5D.lZKJZ.JuZK.ahuQ7BQ3F Ronald Bergan, ''Sergei Eisenstein'' – The New York Times.]</ref><ref>[http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=11752 Literaty Encyclopedia]</ref> and his mother, Julia Ivanovna Konetskaya, was from a [[Russian people|Russian]] [[Orthodox Christian|Orthodox]] family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Эйзенштейн|1968}} [http://lib.ru/CINEMA/kinolit/EJZENSHTEJN/s_avtobiografiya.txt]</ref> According to other sources, both of his paternal grandparents were of [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] descent.<ref>Sergei Eisenstein (1964).

At the [[Petrograd]] Institute of Civil Engineering, Sergei studied architecture and engineering, the profession of his father.<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=28}}</ref> In 1918 Sergei left school and joined the [[Red Army]] to serve the [[Russian Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], although his father Mikhail supported the opposite side.<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|pp=34–35}}</ref> This brought his father to Germany after the defeat of the Tsarist government, and Sergei to Petrograd, [[Vologda]], and [[Dvinsk]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=35}}</ref> In 1920, Sergei was transferred to a command position in [[Minsk]], after success providing [[propaganda]] for the [[October Revolution]]. At this time, he was exposed to [[Kabuki]] theatre and studied [[Japanese language|Japanese]], learning some 300 [[kanji]] characters, which he cited as an influence on his pictorial development.<ref>{{Harvnb|Эйзенштейн|1968}} [http://lib.ru/CINEMA/kinolit/EJZENSHTEJN/s_kak_ya_stal_rezhisserom.txt]</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=37}}</ref> These studies would lead him to travel to [[Japan]].

===From theatre to cinema===
[[File:Sadanji Ichikawa II and Sergei Eisenstein.jpg|thumb|With Japanese [[kabuki]] actor Sadanji Ichikawa II, Moscow, 1928]]
In 1920 Eisenstein moved to Moscow, and began his career in theatre working for [[Proletkult]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=41}}</ref> His productions there were entitled ''Gas Masks,'' ''Listen Moscow,'' and ''[[Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man|Wiseman]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=529}}</ref> Eisenstein would then work as a designer for [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|pp=46–48}}</ref> In 1923 Eisenstein began his career as a theorist,<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=61}}</ref> by writing ''The Montage of Attractions'' for [[LEF (journal)|LEF]].<ref>{{harvnb|Christie|Taylor|1994|pp=87–89}}</ref> Eisenstein's first film, ''[[Glumov's Diary]]'' (for the theatre production ''[[Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man|Wiseman]]''), was also made in that same year with [[Dziga Vertov]] hired initially as an "instructor."<ref>{{Harvnb|Эйзенштейн|1968}} [http://lib.ru/CINEMA/kinolit/EJZENSHTEJN/s_moya_pervaya_filxma.txt]</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Goodwin|1993|p=32}}</ref>

''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925) was Eisenstein's first full-length feature film. ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) was acclaimed critically worldwide. It was mostly his international critical renown which enabled Eisenstein to direct ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'' (aka ''Ten Days That Shook The World'') as part of a grand tenth anniversary celebration of the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, and then ''[[The General Line]]'' (aka ''Old and New''). The critics of the outside world praised them, but at home, Eisenstein's focus in these films on structural issues such as camera angles, crowd movements, and [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] brought him and like-minded others, such as [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] and [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], under fire from the Soviet film community, forcing him to issue public articles of self-criticism and commitments to reform his cinematic visions to conform to the increasingly specific doctrines of [[socialist realism]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Travels to Europe===
In the autumn of 1928, with ''October'' still under fire in many Soviet quarters, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe, accompanied by his perennial film collaborator [[Grigori Aleksandrov]] and cinematographer [[Eduard Tisse]]. Officially, the trip was supposed to allow Eisenstein and company to learn about sound motion pictures and to present the famous Soviet artists in person to the capitalist West. For Eisenstein, however, it was also an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside those found within the Soviet Union. He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin, Zurich, London, and Paris.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eisenstein|1972|p=8}}</ref> In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by Tissé entitled ''[[Frauennot - Frauenglück]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993| p= 16}}</ref>

===American projects===
In late April 1930, [[Jesse L. Lasky]], on behalf of [[Paramount Pictures]], offered Eisenstein the opportunity to make a film in the United States.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=12}}</ref> He accepted a short-term contract for $100,000 and arrived in [[Hollywood]] in May 1930.

Eisenstein proposed a biography of munitions tycoon [[Sir Basil Zaharoff]] and a film version of ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]], and more fully developed plans for a film of ''[[Sutter's Gold]]'' by [[Jack London]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Montagu|1968|p=151}}</ref> but on all accounts failed to impress the studio's producers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=172}}</ref> Paramount then proposed a movie version of [[Theodore Dreiser]]'s ''[[An American Tragedy]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=174}}</ref> This excited Eisenstein, who had read and liked the work, and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow. Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930,<ref>{{Harvnb|Montagu|1968|p=209}}</ref> but Paramount disliked it completely and, additionally, found themselves intimidated by [[Frank Pease|Major Frank Pease]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=167}}</ref> president of the ''Hollywood Technical Director's Institute''. Pease, an anti-communist, mounted a public campaign against Eisenstein. On October 23, 1930, by "mutual consent," Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract null and void, and the Eisenstein party were treated to return tickets to Moscow at Paramount's expense.<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|pp=185–186}}</ref>

Eisenstein was thus faced with returning home a failure. The Soviet film industry was solving the sound-film issue without him and his films, techniques, and theories were becoming increasingly attacked as 'ideological failures' and prime examples of [[Formalist film theory|formalism]]. Many of his theoretical articles from this period, such as ''[[Eisenstein on Disney]]'', have surfaced decades later as seminal scholarly texts used as curriculum in film schools around the world. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Eisenstein and his entourage spent considerable time with [[Charlie Chaplin]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Montagu|1968|pp=89–97}}</ref> who recommended that Eisenstein meet with a sympathetic benefactor in the person of American socialist author [[Upton Sinclair]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=187}}</ref> Sinclair's works had been accepted by and were widely read in the USSR, and were known to Eisenstein. The two had mutual admiration and between the end of October 1930 and Thanksgiving of that year, Sinclair had secured an extension of Eisenstein's absences from the USSR, and permission for him to travel to Mexico. The trip to Mexico was for Eisenstein to make a film produced by Sinclair and his wife, [[Mary Craig Sinclair|Mary Craig Kimbrough Sinclair]], and three other investors organized as the "Mexican Film Trust".<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=188}}</ref>

===Mexican odyssey===
On November 24, 1930, Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust "upon the basis of his desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be, and in full faith in Eisenstein's artistic integrity."<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=189}}</ref> The contract also stipulated that the film would be "non-political," that immediately available funding came from Mary Sinclair in an amount of "not less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars,"<ref name = "Geduld & Gottesman, p. 22">{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=22}}</ref> that the shooting schedule amounted to "a period of from three to four months,"<ref name = "Geduld & Gottesman, p. 22" /> and most importantly that "Eisenstein furthermore agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico, all negative film and positive prints, and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture, will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair..."<ref name = "Geduld & Gottesman, p. 22" /> A codicil to the contract allowed that the "Soviet Government may have the [finished] film free for showing inside the U.S.S.R."<ref>{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=23}}</ref>  Reportedly, it was verbally clarified that the expectation was for a finished film of about an hour's duration.

By 4 December, Eisenstein was en route to Mexico by train, accompanied by Aleksandrov and Tisse. Later he produced a brief synopsis of the six-part film which would come, in one form or another, to be the final plan Eisenstein would settle on for his project. The title for the project, ''[[¡Que viva México!]]'', was decided on some time later still. While in Mexico Eisenstein mixed socially with [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. Eisenstein admired these artists and Mexican culture in general, and they inspired Eisenstein to call his films "moving frescoes".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=19}}</ref> The Left U.S. film community eagerly followed Eisenstein's progress within Mexico as is chronicled within Chris Robe's book ''Left of Hollywood: Cinema, Modernism, and the Emergence of U.S. Radical Film Cutlure''.<ref>Left of Hollywood: Cinema, Modernism, and the Emergence of U.S. Radical Film Culture</ref>

After a prolonged absence, Stalin sent a telegram expressing the concern that Eisenstein had become a deserter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=513}}</ref> Under pressure, Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair's younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, who had been sent along to act as a line producer, for the film's problems.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=281}}</ref> Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to insinuate themselves between him and Stalin, so Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way. The furious Sinclairs shut down production and ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage and the three Soviets to see what they could do with the film already shot, estimates ranging from 170,000 lineal feet with ''Soldadera'' unfilmed,<ref>{{Harvnb|Eisenstein|1972|p=14}}</ref> to an excess of 250,000 lineal feet.<ref>{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=132}}</ref>

For the unfinished filming of the "novel" of ''Soldadera'', without incurring any cost, Eisenstein had secured 500 soldiers, 10,000 guns, and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> but this was lost due to Sinclair's cancelling of production. When Eisenstein arrived at the American border, a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings of [[Jesus]] caricatures amongst other lewd pornographic material.<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|pp=234–235}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|pp=309–310}}</ref> His re-entry visa had expired,<ref name="Geduld & Gottesman, p. 288">{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=288}}</ref> and Sinclair's contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension. Eisenstein, Aleksandrov, and Tisse were allowed, after a month's stay at the [[U.S.-Mexico border]] outside [[Laredo, Texas]], a 30-day "pass" to get from Texas to New York,<ref name="Geduld & Gottesman, p. 288"/> and thence depart for Moscow, while Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining film.

Eisenstein toured the American South, on his way to New York. In mid-1932, the Sinclairs were able to secure the services of [[Sol Lesser]], who had just opened his distribution office in New York, Principal Distributing Corporation. Lesser agreed to supervise post-production work on the miles of negative&nbsp;— at the Sinclairs' expense&nbsp;— and distribute any resulting product. Two short [[feature film]]s and a [[short subject]]&nbsp;— ''Thunder Over Mexico'' based on the "Maguey" footage,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=21}}</ref> ''Eisenstein in Mexico'', and ''Death Day'' respectively&nbsp;— were completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934.
Eisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair-Lesser films, nor a later effort by his first biographer, [[Marie Seton]], called ''[[Time in the Sun]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=446}}</ref> He would publicly maintain that he had lost all interest in the project.

===Return to Soviet Union===
[[File:Sergei Eisenstein 02.jpg|thumb|left|Eisenstein c. 1935]]
Eisenstein's foray onto the west made the staunchly Stalinist film industry look upon him with a suspicion that would never completely disappear. He apparently spent some time in a mental hospital in [[Kislovodsk]] in July 1933,<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=280}}</ref> ostensibly a result of depression born of his final acceptance that he would never be allowed to edit the Mexican footage, turned over by Sinclair to Hollywood editors, who would irreparably alter the negatives.<ref name="Leyda 1960 p=299">{{Harvnb|Leyda|1960|p=299}}</ref>

He was subsequently assigned a teaching position with the film school GIK (now [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]]) where he had taught earlier and in 1933 and 1934 was in charge of writing curriculum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993| p= 140}}</ref> Eisenstein married filmmaker and writer [[Vera Atasheva]] (1900–65) in 1934 <ref>{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=33}}</ref> and remained married until his death in 1948, though there is some speculation about his sexuality.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aldrich & Wotherspoon|2002}} pp. 170–71.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/sochi-2014-lgbt-gay-russia-winter-olympics-tchaikovsky|title=Putin's pride? Six famous gay sons of Russia|date=8 February 2014|publisher=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref>

In 1935, he began another project, ''[[Bezhin Meadow]]'', but it appears the film was afflicted with many of the same problems as ''Que Viva Mexico.'' Eisenstein unilaterally decided to film two versions of the scenario, one for adult viewers and one for children; failed to define a clear shooting schedule; and shot film prodigiously, resulting in cost overruns and missed deadlines. Even though Soviet film executive [[Boris Shumyatsky]] encouraged Sinclair in undermining Eisenstein<ref name="Leyda 1960 p=299"/> it was derailed not as much as ''Bezhin Meadow'' by the Soviet film industry, but by its American backers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leyda|1960|p=275}}</ref>

The thing which appeared to save Eisenstein's career at this point was that Stalin ended up taking the position that the ''Bezhin Meadow'' catastrophe, along with several other problems facing the industry at that point, had less to do with Eisenstein's approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been supervising him. Ultimately this came down on the shoulders of [[Boris Shumyatsky]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=369}}</ref> "executive producer" of Soviet film since 1932, who in early 1938 was denounced, arrested, tried and convicted as a traitor, and shot. (The production executive at Film studio [[Mosfilm]], where Meadow was being made, was also replaced, but without further executions.) {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Comeback===
Eisenstein was thence able to ingratiate himself with Stalin for 'one more chance', and he chose, from two offerings, the assignment of a biopic of ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]],'' with music composed by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]. This time, he was assigned a co-scenarist, [[Pyotr Pavlenko]],<ref name="Bordwell, p. 27">{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=27}}</ref> to bring in a completed script; professional actors to play the roles; and an assistant director, [[Dmitri Ivanovich Vasilyev|Dmitri Vasilyev]], to expedite shooting.<ref name = "Bordwell, p. 27" />

The result was a film critically received by both the Soviets and in the West, which won him the [[Order of Lenin]] and the [[Stalin Prize]].<ref name="Bordwell, p. 28">{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=28}}</ref> It was an obvious allegory and stern warning against the massing forces of Nazi Germany, well played and well made. The script had Nevsky utter a number of traditional Russian [[proverb]]s, verbally rooting his fight against the Germanic invaders in Russian traditions.<ref>Kevin McKenna. 2009. “Proverbs and the Folk Tale in the Russian Cinema: The Case of Sergei Eisenstein’s Film Classic ''Aleksandr Nevsky''.”  ''The Proverbial «Pied Piper» A Festschrift Volume of Essays in Honor of Wolfgang Mieder on the Occasion of His Sixty-Fifth Birthday'', ed. by Kevin McKenna, pp. 277–92. New York, Bern: Peter Lang.</ref> This was started, completed, and placed in distribution all within the year 1938, and represented not only Eisenstein's first film in nearly a decade but also his first sound film.

Within months of its release, Stalin entered into a [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|pact]] with Hitler, and ''Nevsky'' was promptly pulled from distribution. Eisenstein returned to teaching and was assigned to direct [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walküre]]'' at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]].<ref name="Bordwell, p. 28" /> After the outbreak of war with Germany in 1941, ''Nevsky'' was re-released into wide distribution and earned international success. With the war approaching Moscow, Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]], where he first considered the idea of making a film about Czar Ivan IV. Eisenstein corresponded with Prokofiev from Alma Ata, and was joined by him there in 1942. Prokofiev composed [[Ivan the Terrible (Prokofiev)|the score]] for Eisenstein's film and Eisenstein reciprocated by designing sets for an operatic rendition of ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]'' that Prokofiev was developing.<ref>{{harvnb|Leyda|Voynow|1982|p=146}}</ref>

===Ivan trilogy===
Eisenstein's film, ''[[Ivan The Terrible, Part I]]'', presenting [[Ivan IV of Russia]] as a national hero, won [[Joseph Stalin]]'s approval (and a [[Stalin Prize]]),<ref>{{harvnb|Neuberger|2003|p=22}}</ref> but the sequel, ''[[Ivan The Terrible, Part II]]'' was criticized by various authorities and would go unreleased until 1958. All footage from the still incomplete ''[[Ivan The Terrible|Ivan The Terrible, Part III]]'' was confiscated, and most of it was destroyed<ref>{{harvnb|Leyda|Voynow|1982|p=135}}</ref> (though several filmed scenes still exist today).

Eisenstein's health was also failing: he was struck by a [[heart attack]] during the making of this picture, and soon died of another at the age of 50.<ref>{{harvnb|Neuberger|2003|p=23}}</ref> He was found on the floor of his Moscow flat on the morning of February 11, 1948. The body lay in state in the Hall of the Cinema Workers, beneath a gold-embroidered velvet pall and surrounded by a profusion of flowers, before being cremated on February 13. The ashes were buried in the snow-covered ground of the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cavendish|first=Richard|title=The Death of Sergei Eisenstein|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/death-sergei-eisenstein|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref>

==Film theorist==
Eisenstein was a pioneer in the use of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]], a specific use of [[film editing]]. He and his contemporary, [[Lev Kuleshov]], two of the earliest film theorists, argued that montage was the essence of the cinema. His articles and books&nbsp;— particularly ''Film Form'' and ''The Film Sense''&nbsp;— explain the significance of montage in detail.

His writings and films have continued to have a major impact on subsequent filmmakers. Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just expounding a scene or moment, through a "linkage" of related images. Eisenstein felt the "collision" of shots could be used to manipulate the emotions of the audience and create film metaphors. He believed that an idea should be derived from the juxtaposition of two independent shots, bringing an element of collage into film. He developed what he called "methods of montage":
#Metric<ref>{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=72}}</ref>
#Rhythmic<ref>{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=73}}</ref>
#Tonal<ref>{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=75}}</ref>
#Overtonal<ref>{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=78}}</ref>
#Intellectual<ref>{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=82}}</ref>

Eisenstein taught film-making during his career at GIK where he wrote the curricula for the directors' course;<ref>{{Harvnb|Nizhniĭ|1962|p=93}}</ref> his classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir Nizhniĭ's ''Lessons with Eisenstein.'' Exercises and examples for students were based on rendering literature such as [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s ''[[Le Père Goriot]].''<ref>{{Harvnb|Nizhniĭ|1962|p=3}}</ref> Another hypothetical was the staging of the [[Haiti]]an struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradov's ''The Black Consul,''<ref>{{Harvnb|Nizhniĭ|1962|p=21}}</ref> influenced as well by John Vandercook's ''Black Majesty.''<ref>{{harvnb|Leyda|Voynow|1982|p=74}}</ref>

Lessons from this scenario delved into the character of [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], replaying his movements, actions, and the drama surrounding him. Further to the didactics of literary and dramatic content, Eisenstein taught the technicalities of directing, photography, and editing, while encouraging his students' development of individuality, expressiveness, and creativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nizhniĭ|1962|pp=148–155}}</ref> Eisenstein's pedagogy, like his films, were politically charged and contained quotes from [[Vladimir Lenin]] interwoven with his teaching.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nizhniĭ|1962|p=143}}</ref>

In his initial films, Eisenstein did not use professional actors. His narratives eschewed individual characters and addressed broad social issues, especially [[class conflict]]. He used stock characters, and the roles were filled with untrained people from the appropriate classes; he avoided casting [[Movie star|stars]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=185}}</ref> Eisenstein's vision of [[communism]] brought him into conflict with officials in the ruling regime of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Like many [[Bolshevik]] artists, Eisenstein envisioned a new society which would subsidize artists totally,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Sergei_Eisenstein|title=Eisenstein|publisher=New Word Encyclopedia}}</ref> freeing them from the confines of bosses and budgets, leaving them absolutely free to create, but budgets and producers were as significant to the Soviet film industry as the rest of the world. Due to the fledgling war, the revolution-wracked and isolated new nation didn't have the resources to nationalize its film industry at first. When it did, limited resources&nbsp;— both monetary and equipment&nbsp;— required production controls as extensive as in the capitalist world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Sergei_Eisenstein|title=Eisenstein's resources|publisher=New Word Encyclopedia}}</ref>
