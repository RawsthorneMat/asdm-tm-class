'''Dennis Moore''' (born '''Dennis Meadows''' January 26, 1908 in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]  &ndash; March 1, 1964 in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[California]]) was an [[actor]] who specialized in [[Westerns|western]]  films and [[film serial]]s.

He began appearing in short subjects and low-budget feature films in the 1930s under the name "Denny Meadows," and enjoyed greater recognition and employment after he changed his professional name to Dennis Moore. His dark looks and solemn demeanor kept him working steadily as an all-purpose utility player, in both heroic and villainous roles. Moore became a familiar face in westerns but never became a major star. He also appeared on television in the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] ''[[The Range Rider]]'', with [[Jock Mahoney]] and [[Dick Jones (actor)|Dick Jones]], in the 1955 [[CBS]] series ''[[Brave Eagle]]'' with [[Keith Larsen]], and in the 1956 episode "Panhandle" of the CBS series, ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'', with [[Willard Parker]] and [[Harry Lauter]].

He was cast as Mr. Finley in "The Gold Watch" and as Jeb in "A Permanent Juliet" on the [[NBC]] western series, ''[[Buckskin (TV series)|Buckskin]]'', starring [[Tom Nolan (actor)|Tom Nolan]], [[Sally Brophy]], and [[Mike Road]]. He was cast as Walker in the 1958 episode, "Three Wanted Men," of the syndicated western series, ''[[Frontier Doctor]],'' starring [[Rex Allen]]. At this time, he also made multiple appearances on [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]]'s syndicated western series, ''[[Mackenzie's Raiders]]''.

He also guest starred on the syndicated adventure series, ''[[Rescue 8]]'', starring [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]] and [[Lang Jeffries]],  the crime drama, ''[[Sheriff of Cochise|U.S. Marshal]]'', starring [[John Bromfield]], and the NBC western ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', starring [[Darren McGavin]].

Moore played leads or second leads in serials and holds the distinction of having appeared in the very last serials produced by [[Universal Pictures]] in 1946 and [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1956.
