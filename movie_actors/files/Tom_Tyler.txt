'''Tom Tyler''' (August 9, 1903 – May 3, 1954) was an American actor known for his leading roles in low-budget [[Western (genre)|Western]] films in the silent and sound eras, and for his portrayal of superhero [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] in the 1941 [[serial film]] ''[[The Adventures of Captain Marvel]]''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Tyler was born '''Vincent Markowski''' on August 9, 1903 in [[Port Henry, New York]] to Lithuanian-American parents,<ref name="chapman-9">Chapman, p. 9.</ref> Helen (née Montvilos) and Frank Markowski.<ref name="b-westerns">{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Chuck|title=Tom Tyler|publisher=B-Westerns|url=http://www.b-westerns.com/tyler.htm|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}</ref> He had two brothers, Frank Jr. and Joe (who changed his last name to Marko), and two sisters, Katherine (Mrs. Slepski) and Maliane "Molly" (Mrs. Redge). He made his [[First Communion]] in a small church in [[Mineville-Witherbee, New York|Mineville]] around 1910.<ref name="b-westerns"/> His father and older brother worked in the mines for the Witherbee Sherman Company.<ref name="chapman-10">Chapman, p. 10.</ref> In 1913, his family moved to [[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]], Michigan where he attended St. Florian Elementary School and Hamtramck High School.<ref name="b-westerns"/> After graduating high school, he left home and made his way west, finding work as a seaman on a merchant steamer, a coal miner in Pennsylvania, a lumberjack in the Northwest, and even a prizefighter.<ref name="b-westerns"/><ref name="rainey-137">Rainey, p. 137.</ref>

===Weightlifting===
Tyler was an amateur weightlifter sponsored by the Los Angeles Athletic Club during the late 1920s. He set a new world's amateur record for the right-hand clean and jerk by lifting 213 pounds.<ref name="rainey-138">Rainey, p. 138.</ref> In 1928, he won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) heavyweight weightlifting championship, lifting 760 pounds—a record that stood for fourteen years.<ref name="rainey-138"/><ref name="lift">{{cite web|last=Curry|first=Butch|title=Senior National Weightlifting Champions|publisher=Lifttilyadie.com|url=http://www.lifttilyadie.com/Results/AAUChamps.htm|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}</ref>

===Early film career===
Around 1924, Tyler arrived in California and found work in the film industry as a prop man and [[Extra (acting)|extra]].<ref name="b-westerns"/> His first screen appearances as an extra included ''Three Weeks'' (1924), ''Leatherstocking'' (1924), and ''Wild Horse Mesa'' (1925). In 1925, Tyler was signed to a contract with [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO) to star in a series of Western adventures with a starting salary of about $75 per week.<ref name="b-westerns"/> His first starring role was in ''Let's Go Gallagher'' (1925). In the next four years, he starred in 28 additional Westerns for FBO, including ''The Masquerade Bandit'' (1926), ''The Sonora Kid'' (1927), ''The Texas Tornado'' (1928), ''The Avenging Rider'' (1928), and ''Pride of the Pawnee'' (1929). While romance was generally underplayed in these early Westerns, a number of up-and-coming heroines—including [[Doris Hill]], [[Jean Arthur]], and Nora Lane—contributed to the overall appeal of Tyler's films,<ref name="rainey-139">Rainey, p. 139.</ref> which enjoyed critical praise and were popular with Saturday matinee audiences.<ref name="b-westerns"/> His four years with FBO gave him valuable riding and acting experience, and made him a popular cowboy hero in the latter years of the silent film era.<ref name="b-westerns"/>

In 1929, Tyler was signed with Syndicate Pictures, where he made his last eight silent films in 1929 and 1930, which included ''The Man from Nevada'' (1929), ''Pioneers of the West'' (1929), ''The Canyon of Missing Men'' (1930), and ''Call of the Desert'' (1930). In 1930, Tyler was loaned out to [[Mascot Pictures]] for his first "all talking" sound film, ''The Phantom of the West'', a typical ten-chapter Saturday matinee cowboy cliffhanger featuring a mysterious secret villain and numerous stunts and action sequences. [[Kermit Maynard]], the brother of Ken Maynard, was Tyler's stunt double in the more dangerous sequences.<ref name="b-westerns"/> In 1931, Tyler made his first Syndicate sound film, ''West of Cheyenne'', which showcased an excellent voice for Westerns, despite his awkward delivery of lines. Tyler concluded his contract with Syndicate Pictures with ''Rider of the Plains'' (1931) and ''God's Country and the Man'' (1931).<ref name="b-westerns"/>

===Monogram Pictures===
In 1931, the fledgling [[Monogram Pictures]] signed Tyler to an eight-picture contract as part of the company's  sagebrush series. These typical low-budget "quickies" included ''Man from Death Valley'' (1931), ''Single-Handed Saunders'' (1932), ''The Man from New Mexico'' (1932), and ''Honor of the Mounted'' (1932)—each made for about $8000. All of his Monogram films received critical and popular support.<ref name="b-westerns"/> When Monogram chose [[Bob Steele (actor)|Bob Steele]] to star in the next season's series, Tyler moved over to Universal to do three chapter plays—a safari yarn called ''Jungle Mystery'' (1932), ''Clancy of the Mounted'' (1933), and ''Phantom of the Air'' (1933)—while managing to fit in four low-budget Westerns for Freuler Monarch Pictures, including ''The Forty-Niners'' (1932), ''When a Man Rides Alone'' (1933), ''Deadwood Pass'' (1933), and ''War on the Range'' (1933).<ref name="b-westerns"/>

===Reliable Pictures and Victory Pictures===
In 1934, Tyler signed a two-year contract with [[Harry S. Webb]]'s Reliable Pictures for eighteen low-budget Western films, tailored as second features on double bills for second and third tier movie houses.<ref name="b-westerns"/> These films included ''Mystery Ranch'' (1934), ''Silver Bullet'' (1935), ''Born to Battle'' (1935), ''Silent Valley'' (1935), ''Fast Bullets'' (1936), and ''Santa Fe Bound'' (1936). Despite a few well-done scenes and some good performances by supporting players like [[Slim Whitaker]], [[Charles King (actor)|Charles King]], and [[Earl Dwire]], most of these films were of average quality with production shortcomings that restricted the effectiveness of Tyler's performances.<ref name="b-westerns"/> By 1936, companies such as [[Republic Pictures]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] were producing larger budget better-quality Western films with impressive exterior locations that overshadowed the type of [[Poverty Row]] low-budget offerings that brought Tyler to fame.<ref name="b-westerns"/>

In 1936, Tyler signed a two-year contract with [[Sam Katzman]]'s new Victory Pictures for eight Western films, each budgeted at about $6000. The first five of these films were directed by Bob Hill and included ''Cheyenne Rides Again'' (1937) with Lucile Brown and ''The Feud of the Trail'' (1937) in which Tyler played a dual role. Of lesser quality, the final three included two co-starring his wife, Jeanne Martel: ''[[Orphan of the Pecos]]'' (1937) and ''Lost Ranch'' (1937), the latter containing a rare scene in which Tyler [[lip sync]]s two songs: "Tucson Mary" and "Home on the Range".<ref name="b-westerns"/> Following ''Brothers of the West'' (1937), Katzman did not renew Tyler's contract with Victory, replacing him with [[Tim McCoy]] as the company's top Western star.<ref name="b-westerns"/>

With no starring roles being offered to him, Tyler took a job with the Wallace Brothers Circus in 1938.<ref name="b-westerns"/> He returned to Hollywood and appeared in supporting roles and bit parts in several feature films, including [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) with [[John Wayne]], ''[[Drums Along the Mohawk]]'' (1939) with [[Henry Fonda]], ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'' (1940) with [[Clark Gable]], ''[[The Westerner (film)|The Westerner]]'' (1940) with [[Gary Cooper]], and John Ford's ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940) also with Henry Fonda.<ref name="b-westerns"/> 

===Republic Pictures and popular serials===
In 1941, Tyler signed a two-year contract with [[Republic Pictures]] to star in 13 films in the popular ''[[The Three Mesquiteers]]'' series in the role of Stony Brooke opposite [[Bob Steele (actor)|Bob Steele]] playing Tucson Smith, [[Rufe Davis]] playing Lullaby Joslin, and [[Jimmie Dodd]] playing Lullaby Joslin.<ref name="b-westerns"/> His $150 per week salary during the first year was increased to $200 per week for the second year.<ref name="b-westerns"/> These final 13 films in ''The Three Mesquiteers'' series (39 through 51) represent some of Tyler's best work, and his last leading roles: ''[[Outlaws of Cherokee Trail]]'' (1941), ''[[Gauchos of El Dorado]]'' (1941), ''[[West of Cimarron]]'' (1941), ''[[Code of the Outlaw]]'' (1942), ''[[Raiders of the Range]]'' (1942), ''[[Westward Ho (1942 film)|Westward Ho]]'' (1942), ''[[The Phantom Plainsmen]]'' (1942), ''[[Shadows on the Sage]]'' (1942), ''[[Valley of Hunted Men]]'' (1942), ''[[Thundering Trails]]'' (1943), ''[[The Blocked Trail]]'' (1943), ''[[Santa Fe Scouts]]'' (1943), and ''[[Riders of the Rio Grande]]'' (1943), the last film in the series.<ref name="b-westerns"/>

During this period, Republic Pictures, which failed to secure the rights to ''Superman'', purchased the rights to another comic superhero, ''Captain Marvel''. In his late thirties at the time, Tyler was still in good shape and physique and was offered the title role at $250 per week for four weeks work. In the title role in ''[[The Adventures of Captain Marvel]]'' (1941), Tyler portrayed the first film adaptation of a comic-strip superhero.<ref name="b-westerns"/>

Tyler also starred in ''[[The Phantom (serial)|The Phantom]]'' (1943), based on [[Lee Falk]]'s famous [[comic strip]]. Tyler personified the role, looking especially striking in the character's familiar costume, and much of the serial's great success was due to Tyler himself. It was Tyler's last major screen role. [[Columbia Pictures]] intended to make a sequel to ''The Phantom'' for years, but the studio's rights to the Phantom property eventually lapsed. The story was hastily rewritten as ''[[The Adventures of Captain Africa]]'', starring [[John Hart (actor)|John Hart]], and footage of Tyler's Phantom appears in some of the long shots.

===Later years===
In 1943, the forty-year-old Tyler was diagnosed with severe [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. He was physically limited to occasional supporting roles in Western films, including ''San Antonio'' (1945) with [[Errol Flynn]]; ''They Were Expendable'' (1945), ''Red River'' (1948), and ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'' (1949) with John Wayne; ''Badman's Territory'' (1946) with [[Randolph Scott]]; ''Masked Raiders'' (1949), ''Riders of the Range'' (1950), ''Rio Grande Patrol'' (1951), and ''Road Agent'' (1952) with [[Tim Holt]]; ''West of the Brazos'' (1950) and several other films with [[James Ellison (actor)|James Ellison]]; ''Trail of Robin Hood'' (1950) with [[Roy Rogers]]; and ''Best of the Badmen'' (1951) with [[Robert Ryan]]. Beginning in 1950, Tyler transitioned to television work, finding minor roles on ''The Lone Ranger'' (1950), ''Dick Tracy'' (1950), ''The Cisco Kid'' (1950–1951), ''The Range Rider'' (1951–1952), and ''The Roy Rogers Show'' (1952). His final television appearances were in four episodes of ''[[The Gene Autry Show]]'' in 1952 and 1953.<ref name="b-westerns"/>

==Death==
Suffering from severe rheumatoid arthritis and nearly destitute, Tyler moved back to Hamtramck and lived with his sister, Katherine Slepski, during the last year of his life. He died on May 3, 1954 of [[heart failure]] and complications from [[scleroderma]] at the age of 50. He was buried in [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Detroit)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]] in Detroit.<ref name="b-westerns"/>

==Marriage==
Tyler married actress Jeanne Martel in September 1937.<ref name="b-westerns"/> They met the previous year while filming ''Santa Fe Bound'' in which she was his leading lady. They appeared in two other films together in 1937, ''[[Lost Ranch]]'' and ''[[Orphan of the Pecos]]''. She most likely accompanied him on the road with the Wallace Brothers Circus in 1938. According to a United States census, they were still married in May 1940, but most likely separated and divorced soon after.<ref name="b-westerns"/>
