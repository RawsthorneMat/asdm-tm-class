'''Wong Kar-wai''', [[Bronze Bauhinia Star|BBS]] (born 17 July 1958) is a [[Hong Kong Second Wave]] filmmaker, internationally renowned as an [[auteur]] for his visually unique, highly stylised, emotionally resonant work, including ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'' (1990), ''[[Ashes of Time]]'' (1994), ''[[Chungking Express]]'' (1994), ''[[Fallen Angels (1995 film)|Fallen Angels]]'' (1995), ''[[Happy Together (1997 film)|Happy Together]]'' (1997), ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Grandmaster (film)|The Grandmaster]]'' (2013). His film ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' (2000), starring [[Maggie Cheung]] and [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai|Tony Leung]], garnered widespread critical acclaim. Wong's films frequently feature protagonists who yearn for romance in the midst of a knowingly brief life and scenes that can often be described as sketchy, digressive, exhilarating, and containing vivid imagery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bordwell|first=Kristin Thompson, David|title=Film History: An Introduction|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-338613-3|page=651|edition=3rd ed.}}</ref>

Wong was the first Chinese director to win the Best Director Award of [[Cannes Film Festival]] (for his work ''[[Happy Together (1997 film)|Happy Together]]'' in 1997). Wong was the President of the Jury at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]], which makes him the only Chinese person to preside over the jury at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. He was also the President of the Jury at the [[63rd Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 2013.<ref name="Berlin">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=The International Jury 2013 |accessdate=2012-12-13 |work=berlinale}}</ref>

Wong was listed at number three on the [[British Film Institute]]'s ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' Top Ten Directors list of modern times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/63 |title=Sight & Sound &#124; Modern Times |publisher=BFI |date=25 January 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, Wong accepted the [[Legion of Honour|National Order of the Legion of Honour: Knight (Highest Degree)]] from the French Government. In 2013, Wong accepted [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Order of Arts and Letters]]: Commander (Highest Degree) by the [[Minister of Culture (France)|French Minister of Culture]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wong Kar-wai Awarded France’s Biggest Cultural Honor|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2013/05/06/wong-kar-wai-awarded-frances-biggest-cultural-honor/|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref>

==Early career==
Born in Shanghai, he moved to Hong Kong with his parents in 1963. Coming from [[Mainland China]] only speaking [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Shanghainese]], he spent hours in cinemas with his mother. In 1980, after studying two years at [[Hong Kong Polytechnic College]] in [[graphic design]], he enrolled in the Production Training Course organised by Hong Kong [[Television Broadcasts Limited]] (TVB) and became a full-time television screenwriter. In the mid-1980s, he became a screenwriter/director at The Wing Scope Co. and In-gear Film Production Company, the production houses owned by renowned Hong Kong actor /movie producer [[Alan Tang]].

Wong's current style took shape during his apprenticeship with Alan Tang Kwong-Wing, who invested in the first movie he directed, ''[[As Tears Go By (film)|As Tears Go By]]'' (1988). Wong's career took off when he directed the film ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'' (1990), despite losing Alan Tang millions of invested dollars. He is credited with about ten scripts between 1982 and 1987, covering an array of genres from romantic comedy to action drama, but claims to have worked to some extent or another on about fifty more without official credit.<ref name="Hoover and Stokes">{{cite book |last=Stokes |first=Lisa Odham |author2=Michael Hoover  |editor= |others= |title=City on Fire: Hong Kong Cinema |origdate= |origyear= |url= |edition= |series= |year=1999 |publisher=Verso |location=London |isbn=1-85984-203-8 |oclc= |id= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>  He considers ''Final Victory'' (最後勝利, 1986), a dark comedy/crime story for director [[Patrick Tam Kar Ming]], his best script.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Work as director==

===Feature films===
He made his directing debut in 1988 with ''[[As Tears Go By (film)|As Tears Go By]]'', produced by [[Alan Tang]]. A crime [[melodrama]] of the kind then hugely popular, it heavily borrowed from [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Mean Streets]]'' (1974), but already displayed one of Wong's principal trademarks in its atmospheric and sometimes [[Expressionism|expressionistic]] color [[Palette (painting)|palette]]. It is his only box office hit to date. His next film, ''[[Days of Being Wild]]'' (1990), a drama about aimless youth set in the early 1960s, established his trademark form: elliptically plotted mood pieces, with lush visuals and music, about the burden of memory on melancholic, misfit characters. ''Days'' was a box office failure but now regularly tops Hong Kong critics' polls of the best local films ever made. It has been likened by numerous critical commentators to ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', with a central theme of loss.{{sfn|Cousins|2008|p=469}}

Wong went on to direct several more feature films in the 1990s produced by Jet Tone, which allowed him to work at his own pace. Among these was ''[[Chungking Express]]'' (1994), which follows the lives of two Hong Kong policemen and the mysterious women they meet and fall in love with. Originally intended to be a distraction piece for him to get his mind off of the heavily delayed ''[[Ashes of Time]]'', it ended up being one of his most popular films. ''[[Fallen Angels (1995 film)|Fallen Angels]]'' (1995) was originally intended to be the third act of ''Chungking Express'', but when the tone didn't fit with the other two parts, he cut it out and made it a stand-alone movie instead; it is seen{{by whom|date=November 2013}} as a semi-sequel to ''Chungking Express'' and is a neo-noir film about a disillusioned killer trying to overcome the affections of his partner, a strange drifter looking for her ex-boyfriend, and a mute trying to get the world's attention in his own ways, all set against a sordid and surreal urban nightscape.

Wong's fourth movie, ''[[Ashes of Time]]'' (1994), released between ''Chungking Express'' and ''Fallen Angels'', applied his approach to a star-studded [[wuxia]] (martial arts swordplay) story; the desert shoot in Mainland China dragged on for over a year and resulted in one of contemporary Hong Kong cinema's most notorious commercial disasters. His first major international recognition was at the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]] where he won the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] prize for ''[[Happy Together (1997 film)|Happy Together]]'' (1997).<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4812/year/1997.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Happy Together |accessdate=21 September 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> It "uses gorgeous, saturated images set to an eclectic soundtrack of tango by Argentinian maestro [[Astor Piazzolla]], Brazilian singer [[Caetano Veloso]] and [[Frank Zappa]] instrumentals to chronicle the stormy affair of a gay couple living as expatriates in [[Buenos Aires]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multilingualbooks.com/foreignvids-chin-wongkarwai.html |title=Chinese Directors – Wong Kar-wai |publisher=Multilingualbooks.com |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>

The filming of ''[[In the Mood for Love]]'' (2000) had to be shifted from Beijing to [[Macau]] after the [[Chinese Film Bureau]] demanded to see the completed script. This was all in all a minor setback in the "very complicated evolution" of the project which goes as far back as 1997. It was Wong's intention to make two films, one of which would be titled ''Beijing Summer'', the plot unclear at the time, but eventually taking form in Macau. Here Wong planned to call it ''Three Stories About Food'' but saw it better to settle for only one story, ''A Story About Food'', that centres on a writer. Including scenes shot in [[Bangkok]] and [[Angkor Wat]], the filming took 15 months. This was an especially arduous time for lead actress [[Maggie Cheung]] whose hair and makeup reportedly took five hours each day. She compared the lengthy shoot to a cold she couldn't get rid of{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}. Working without deadlines, the film's upcoming première at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] nonetheless put some pressure on Wong to finish editing. Intending to name the film ''Secrets'' he was dissuaded by Cannes, as there were already many films with that title,<ref>[http://www.indiewire.com/article/decade_wong_kar-wai_on_in_the_mood_for_love Decade: Wong Kar-wai on "In The Mood For Love"|Filmmakers,Film Industry, Film Festivals, Awards & Movie Reviews]. Indiewire (2012-10-26). Retrieved on 2014-05-22.</ref> and finally named it ''In the Mood for Love'' after listening to [[Bryan Ferry]]'s recording of the song [[I'm in the Mood for Love]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Anthony | last=Kaufman | title=INTERVIEW: The "Mood" of Wong Kar-wai; the Asian Master Does it Again | url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_the_mood_of_wong_kar-wai_the_asian_master_does_it_again | date=2 February 2001 | work=[[IndieWire]] | accessdate=22 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/55/ |title=In The Mood For Edinburgh |accessdate=22 August 2007 |last=Rayns |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Rayns |date=August 2000 |work=[[Sight & Sound]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |quote= }}</ref>

Wong established his independent production company, called Jet Tone Films Ltd, with director and producer [[Jeffrey Lau]]. His next film, ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'' (2004), about capturing lost memories, was the third chapter of a shared story that began with ''Days of Being Wild'' and continued with ''In the Mood for Love''. Infamous for long, drawn-out shoots without any real regards to deadlines{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}, a running joke amongst the crew was that he would finish in the year 2046. In 2006, Wong became the first Chinese director to preside the jury at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]].

Wong Kar-wai's first full English-language film, ''[[My Blueberry Nights]]'' (2007), opened the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]] as one of 22 films in competition. The lead, American singer-songwriter [[Norah Jones]], made her acting debut in the film. His next film,  ''[[The Grandmaster (film)|The Grandmaster]]'' was released in 2013.

Despite his background as a screenwriter, one of Wong's trademarks as a director is that he works largely through improvisation and experimentation involving the actors and crew rather than adhering to a fixed screenplay. This has been a frequent source of trouble for his actors, his financial backers and many other people connected with his films, including sometimes himself.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}.

==Screenwriter and producer==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2013}}
Wong is officially credited with about ten screenplays while having worked on another fifty in one way or another before his directorial debut. He has yet to direct a feature based on a script other than his own (though ''[[Ashes of Time]]'' was rather loosely adapted from a [[Louis Cha]] novel), which would be highly unlikely considering his method of improvisation. Wong, through Jet Tone, is also the producer of all of his own films since 1993 with the exception of ''Ashes of Time'', a project that began much earlier. Through Jet Tone or otherwise, Wong has also produced various films, some directed by his partner in the company, Jeffrey Lau.
