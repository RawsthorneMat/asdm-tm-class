==Biography==
Knight was born in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]] the third child and son of James A. and Olive Knight,<ref>United States Federal Census 1920;  Fairmont Ward 8,  Marion,  West Virginia; Roll:  T625_1961; Page:  12B; Enumeration District:  27; Image:  1015.</ref> and attended nearby [[West Virginia University]]<ref>Corneau, Ernest. ''Hall of Fame of Western Film Stars''.  Christopher Publishing, 1969, p. 235</ref> where he was a cheerleader and law student. He wrote a pep song, "Fight Mountaineers," which is still frequently used by the Mountaineer Marching Band 90 years later. He also wrote the melody for a WVU song entitled "To Thee Our Alma Mater," with words by fellow graduate David A. Christopher. He formed his own band in college and played drums,<ref>Corneau, Ernest. ''Hall of Fame of Western Film Stars''.  Christopher Publishing, 1969, p. 235</ref> eventually leaving school to perform in vaudeville and in big bands such as [[Irving Aaronson]]'s and [[George Olsen]]'s.<ref>Fuzzy Knight obituary, Variety, March 3, 1976</ref>

Eventually his musical and comedy skills took him to New York, where he appeared in ''[[Earl Carroll]]'s Vanities'' of 1927 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''Here's Howe'' and ''Ned Wayburn's Gambols''.<ref>Internet Broadway Database http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=67987</ref>  He was billed under his nickname, Fuzzy (given him because of his peculiarly soft voice).<ref>Corneau, Ernest. ''Hall of Fame of Western Film Stars''.  Christopher Publishing, 1969, p. 236</ref>

While touring with bands, Knight came to [[Hollywood]] and appeared in several musical short films for [[MGM]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] between 1929 and 1932.<ref>Fuzzy Knight obituary, Variety, March 3, 1976</ref>  [[Mae West]] gave him his first notable film role in ''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'', and he went on to play in hundreds of films over the next 30 years.  By the 1940s, he was primarily playing in [[Western (genre)|Western movies]] and was voted one of the Top Ten Money-Making Stars in Westerns in 1940.<ref>Corneau, Ernest. ''Hall of Fame of Western Film Stars''.  Christopher Publishing, 1969, p. 236</ref>

Knight became famous to a new generation when he co-starred as [[Buster Crabbe]]'s sidekick on the 1955 television series ''[[Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion]]''.<ref>Corneau, Ernest. ''Hall of Fame of Western Film Stars''.  Christopher Publishing, 1969, p. 236</ref>  In semi-retirement thereafter, Knight continued to make occasional appearances in films and TV shows through 1967.

He died in his sleep at the [[Motion Picture Country House and Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills, California]], and was survived by his wife, actress [[Patricia Ryan]] (née Thelma de Long).<ref>Fuzzy Knight obituary, Variety, March 3, 1976</ref><ref>Corneau, Ernest. ''Hall of Fame of Western Film Stars''. Christopher Publishing, 1969, p. 236</ref> He was buried in [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Burbank, California]]. His grave is next to that of the grave of [[Slapsie Maxie Rosenbloom]], Knight's two-time co-star, who died less than two weeks after Knight.<ref>http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid=6725725&PIpi=3758001</ref>
