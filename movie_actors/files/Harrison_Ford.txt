Ford was active in the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and achieved its second-highest rank, Life Scout. He worked at [[Napowan Adventure Base]] Scout camp as a counselor for the Reptile Study merit badge. Because of this, he and Eagle Scout director [[Steven Spielberg]] later decided to depict the young [[Indiana Jones]] as a Life Scout in the film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. They also jokingly reversed Ford's knowledge of reptiles into Jones' [[Ophidiophobia|fear of snakes]].

In 1960, Ford graduated from [[Maine East High School]] in [[Park Ridge, Illinois]]. His was the first student voice broadcast on his high school's new radio station, [[WMTH]],<ref name=tca/> and he was its first sportscaster during his senior year (1959–60).

==Early career==
In 1964, after a season of [[summer stock]] with the Belfry Players in Wisconsin,<ref>Franzene, Jessica, "Theologians & Thespians," in Welcome Home, a realtors' guide to property history in the Lake Geneva region, August 2012</ref> Ford traveled to Los Angeles, California to apply for a job in radio voice overs. He did not get it, but stayed in California and eventually signed a $150 a week contract with [[Columbia Pictures]]' ''New Talent'' program, playing bit roles in films. His first known part was an uncredited role as a bellhop in ''[[Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round]]'' (1966). There is little record of his non-speaking roles (or "extra" work) in film. Ford was at the bottom of the hiring list, having offended producer Jerry Tokovsky after he played a bellboy in the feature. He was told by Tokovsky that when actor [[Tony Curtis]] delivered a bag of groceries, he did it like a movie star; Ford felt his job was to act like a bellboy.<ref>{{cite web|last=White |first=Dana |url=http://www.amazon.com/Harrison-Ford-Imperfect-Garry-Jenkins/dp/0735100896 |title=Harrison Ford: Imperfect Hero (9780735100893): Garry Jenkins: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> Ford managed to secure other roles in movies, such as ''[[A Time for Killing|A Time for Killing (The Long Ride Home)]]'', starring [[Glenn Ford]], [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] and [[Inger Stevens]].

His speaking roles continued next with ''[[Luv (film)|Luv]]'' (1967), though he was still uncredited. He was finally credited as "Harrison J. Ford" in the 1967 [[Western (genre)|Western]] film, ''[[A Time for Killing]]'', but the "J" did not stand for anything, since he has no middle name. It was added to avoid confusion with [[Harrison Ford (silent film actor)|a silent film actor named Harrison Ford]], who appeared in more than 80 films between 1915 and 1932, and died in 1957. Ford later said that he was unaware of the existence of the earlier Harrison Ford until he came upon a star with his own name on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Ford soon dropped the "J" and worked for [[Universal Studios]], playing minor roles in many television series throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, including ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Love, American Style]]'', and ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''. He appeared in the western ''Journey to Shiloh'' (1968) and had an uncredited, non-speaking role in [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s 1970 film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'', as an arrested student protester. Not happy with the roles being offered to him, Ford became a self-taught professional [[carpentry|carpenter]]<ref name=tca/> to support his then-wife and two small sons. While working as a carpenter, he became a stagehand for the popular rock band [[The Doors]]. He also built a sun deck for actress [[Sally Kellerman]] and a recording studio for Brazilian band leader [[Sérgio Mendes]].

He was then hired to build cabinets at the home of director [[George Lucas]], who subsequently cast him in a pivotal supporting role for his film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973).<ref name=tca/> Ford's relationship with Lucas would profoundly affect his career later on. After director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s film ''[[The Godfather]]'' was a success, he hired Ford to expand his office and gave him small roles in his next two films, ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979); in the latter film he played an army officer named "G. Lucas". During this early period, Ford often came to auditions directly from work still wearing his carpenter's clothes and gear, to subtly remind casting directors that he had other options in life.

==Milestone franchises==

===''Star Wars''===
Harrison Ford's carpentry work for George Lucas eventually landed him his first starring film role, when he was hired by Lucas to read lines for actors auditioning for parts in his then-upcoming film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977). Lucas was eventually won over by Ford's performance during these line reads and cast him as [[Han Solo]].<ref>Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy. Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005]</ref> ''Star Wars'' became one of the most successful movies of all time worldwide and established Ford as a superstar.<ref name=tca/> He went on to star in the similarly successful ''Star Wars'' sequels, ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), as well as the ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' (1978). Ford wanted Lucas to [[kill off]] Han Solo at the end of ''Return of the Jedi'', saying, "That would have given the whole film a bottom," but Lucas refused.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/02/harrison_ford_wanted_han_solo_to_die|title=Harrison Ford Wanted Han Solo to Die|work=Starpulse|date=March 2, 2006}}</ref> 

Ford will reprise the role of Solo for the upcoming ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starwars.com/news/star-wars-episode-7-cast-announced.html|title=Star Wars: Episode VII Cast Announced|work=StarWars.com|date=April 29, 2014|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> During filming on June 11, 2014, Ford suffered what is said to be a fractured ankle when a hydraulic door fell on him.

===''Indiana Jones''===

Ford's status as a leading actor was solidified when he starred as globe-trotting archeologist [[Indiana Jones]] in the film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), a collaboration between George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.<ref name=tca/> Though Spielberg was interested in casting Ford from the start, Lucas was not, due to having already worked with the actor in ''American Graffiti'' and ''Star Wars'', but he eventually relented after [[Tom Selleck]] was unable to accept.<ref name=tca/><ref>(DVD) Indiana Jones: Making the Trilogy. Paramount Pictures. 2003.</ref> 

Ford went on to reprise the role of Jones for the prequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984) and the sequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989).<ref name=tca/> He returned to the role yet again for a 1993 episode of the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', and even later for the fourth film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008).

==Other film work==
Ford has been in other films, including ''[[Heroes (1977 film)|Heroes]]'' (1977), ''[[Force 10 from Navarone (film)|Force 10 from Navarone]]'' (1978), and ''[[Hanover Street (film)|Hanover Street]]'' (1979). Ford also co-starred alongside [[Gene Wilder]] in the buddy-[[Western (genre)|Western]] ''[[The Frisco Kid]]'' (1979), playing a bank robber with a heart of gold. He then starred as [[Rick Deckard]] in [[Ridley Scott]]'s [[cult films|cult]] sci-fi classic ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), and in a number of dramatic-action films: [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), and [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Frantic (film)|Frantic]]'' (1988).<ref name=tca/>

The 1990s brought Ford the role of [[Jack Ryan (fictional character)|Jack Ryan]] in [[Tom Clancy]]'s ''[[Patriot Games (film)|Patriot Games]]'' (1992) and ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'' (1994), as well as leading roles in [[Alan Pakula]]'s ''[[Presumed Innocent (film)|Presumed Innocent]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Devil's Own]]'' (1997), [[Andrew Davis (filmmaker)|Andrew Davis]]' ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' (1993), [[Sydney Pollack]]'s [[remake]] of ''[[Sabrina (1995 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1995), and [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (1997). Ford also played straight dramatic roles, including an adulterous husband in both ''[[Presumed Innocent (film)|Presumed Innocent]]'' (1990) and ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000), and a recovering amnesiac in [[Mike Nichols]]' ''[[Regarding Henry]]'' (1991).<ref name=tca/>

Many of Ford's major film roles came to him by default through unusual circumstances: he won the role of Han Solo while reading lines for other actors, was cast as Indiana Jones because Tom Selleck was not available, and took the role of Jack Ryan supposedly due to [[Alec Baldwin]]'s fee demands, although Baldwin disputes this (Baldwin had previously played the role in ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'').

===Recent roles===
[[File:Harrison Ford.jpg|thumb|upright|Ford in 2007]]
Starting in the late 1990s, Ford appeared in several critically derided and commercially disappointing movies, including ''[[Six Days Seven Nights]]'' (1998), ''[[Random Hearts]]'' (1999), ''[[K-19: The Widowmaker]]'' (2002), ''[[Hollywood Homicide]]'' (2003), ''[[Firewall (film)|Firewall]]'' (2006), and ''[[Extraordinary Measures]]'' (2010). One exception was 2000's ''[[What Lies Beneath]],'' which grossed over $155&nbsp;million in the United States and $291&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=whatliesbeneath.htm |title=What Lies Beneath (2000) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref>

In 2004, Ford declined a chance to star in the thriller ''[[Syriana]]'', later commenting that "I didn't feel strongly enough about the truth of the material and I think I made a mistake."<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 23, 2008|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/03/harrison_ford_regrets_passing_on_syriana|title=Harrison Ford Regrets Passing on 'Syriana'|publisher=Starpulse|date=March 3, 2006}}</ref> The role eventually went to [[George Clooney]], who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his work. Prior to that, he had passed on a role in another [[Stephen Gaghan]]-written role, Robert Wakefield in ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''. That role went to [[Michael Douglas]].

In 2008, Ford enjoyed success with the release of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', another Lucas/Spielberg collaboration.

In July 2011, Ford starred alongside [[Daniel Craig]] and [[Olivia Wilde]] in the [[science fiction Western]] film ''[[Cowboys & Aliens]]''.

On October 23, 1999, Harrison Ford was involved in the crash of a [[Bell 206 Long Ranger|Bell 206L4 LongRanger]] helicopter (N36R). The [[NTSB]] accident report states that Ford was piloting the aircraft over the [[Lake Piru]] riverbed near [[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]], California, on a routine training flight.

In March 2004, Ford officially became chairman of the [[Young Eagles]] program of the [[Experimental Aircraft Association]] (EAA).

===Environmental causes===
Ford is vice-chair of [[Conservation International]]<ref>{{cite news | url= http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/04/29/harrison-ford-environmentalist/ | title= Harrison Ford: There are no great movies on global environmental issues | work=CNN}}</ref> an American nonprofit [[environmental organization]] headquartered in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]].
