'''Sir Ridley Scott''' (born 30 November 1937) is an English film director and producer. Following his commercial breakthrough with the science-fiction horror film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), his best-known works are the neo-noir dystopian science fiction film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982), the drama ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'' (1991), the epic historical drama ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000), which won a Best Picture Oscar, the war film ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' (2001), the crime thriller ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), the comedy-drama ''[[Matchstick Men]]'' (2003), the epic historical drama ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' (2005), the biographical crime film ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'' (2007), the epic adventure film ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'' (2010), and the sci-fi film ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' (2012).

Scott is known for his atmospheric, highly concentrated visual style, which has influenced many other directors. Though his films range widely in setting and period, they frequently showcase memorable imagery of urban environments, whether 2nd century Rome (''Gladiator''), 12th century [[Jerusalem]] (''Kingdom of Heaven''), contemporary [[Osaka]] (''[[Black Rain (1989 American film)|Black Rain]]'') or [[Mogadishu]] (''Black Hawk Down''), or the future cityscapes of ''Blade Runner''. Scott has been nominated for three [[Academy Award for Directing|Academy Awards for Directing]] (for ''Thelma and Louise'', ''Gladiator'' and ''Black Hawk Down''), plus two Golden Globe and two BAFTA Awards. In 2003, Scott was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] at Buckingham Palace for his "services to the British film industry".<ref name="knighted">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3054254.stm |title=Queen knights Gladiator director |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 July 2003 |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> He is the older brother of the late [[Tony Scott]].

==Early life and career==
Scott was born 30 November 1937 in [[South Shields]], Tyne and Wear in the [[North East England|North East of England]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monsters-movies.com/ridley_scott.htm |title=Sir Ridley Scott |publisher=Monsters-movies.com |accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> the son of Elizabeth and Colonel Francis Percy Scott.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://living.scotsman.com/tvradio/How-Winston-helped-save-the.2341166.jp |title=How Winston helped save the nation |work=Scotsman.com Living |date=6 July 2002 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> He was brought up in an [[British Army|army]] family, so for most of his early life, his father&nbsp;– an officer in the [[Corps of Royal Engineers|Royal Engineers]]&nbsp;– was absent. His elder brother, Frank, joined the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]] when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) [[Cumberland]], Wales and Germany. He had a younger brother, [[Tony Scott|Tony]], who also became a film director. After the [[Second World War]], the Scott family moved back to their native [[North East England|North East]], eventually settling on Greens Beck Road, [[Hartburn, County Durham|Hartburn]], [[Stockton on Tees]], [[Teesside]] (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in ''[[Blade Runner]]'').<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/tees/content/articles/2009/03/30/tees_tf_blade_runner_feature.shtml "The Blade Runner Connection"]. BBC. Retrieved 26 November 2014</ref> He studied at [[Grangefield Grammar School]] and [[West Hartlepool College of Art]] from 1954 to 1958, obtaining a Diploma in Design.

Scott went on to study at the [[Royal College of Art]], contributing to college magazine ''ARK'' and helping to establish the college film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, ''[[Boy and Bicycle]]'', starring both his younger brother and his father (the film was later released on the 'Extras' section of ''The Duellists'' DVD). In February 1963 Scott was named in title credits as "Designer" for the BBC television programme [[Tonight (1957 TV series)|''Tonight'']], about the severe winter of 1963. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series ''[[Z-Cars]]'' and science fiction series ''[[Out of the Unknown]]''. He was originally assigned to design the second ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial, ''[[The Daleks]]'', which would have entailed realising the famous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant he was replaced on the serial by [[Raymond Cusick]].<ref name="scott">{{cite book|title=The Handbook: The First Doctor&nbsp;— The William Hartnell Years 1963–1966|first=David J.|last=Howe|authorlink=David J.

(He directed two others, but these have been [[wiping|wiped]].)

In 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.<ref>{{Cite journal

==Early films==

===''The Duellists''===
{{Main|The Duellists}}
''[[The Duellists]]'' (1977) marked Ridley Scott's first feature as director. Shot in Europe, it was nominated for the main prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and won an award for best film. ''The Duellists'' had limited commercial impact internationally. Set during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it follows two French [[Hussar]] officers, D'Hubert and Feraud ([[Keith Carradine]] and [[Harvey Keitel]]) whose quarrel over an initially minor incident turns into a bitter extended feud spanning fifteen years, interwoven with the larger conflict that provides its backdrop. The film has been acclaimed for providing a historically authentic portrayal of Napoleonic uniforms and military conduct.

===''Alien''===
{{Main|Alien (film)}}
Scott had originally planned next to adapt a version of ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'', but after seeing ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', he became convinced of the potential of large scale, effects-driven films. He accepted the job of directing ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', the 1979 horror/science-fiction film that would win him international success.

Scott would not return to an ''Alien''-related project for three more decades, when he directed ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]''. The [[Girl Power in popular culture#Female action heroes and science fiction|female action hero]] [[Ellen Ripley]] (played by [[Sigourney Weaver]]), who appeared in the first four ''Alien'' films, would become a cinematic icon. Scott was involved in the 2003 restoration and re-release of the original film. In promotional interviews at the time, Scott indicated he had been in discussions to make a fifth film in the ''Alien'' franchise. However, in a later (2006) interview, the director remarked that he had been unhappy about ''Alien: The Director's Cut'', feeling that the original was "pretty flawless" and that the additions were merely a marketing tool.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolavconsole/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_6060000/newsid_6068400/bb_rm_6068470.stm |title=A good year ahead for Ridley |publisher=BBC News  |date=20 October 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> (See [[#2006–present|2006 – present section]], for more on ''Prometheus''.)

===''Blade Runner''===
{{Main|Blade Runner}}
After a year working on the film adaptation of ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', and following the sudden death of his brother Frank, Scott signed to direct the film version of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''. Starring [[Harrison Ford]], ''Blade Runner'' was a commercial disappointment in cinemas in 1982, but is now regarded as a classic. In 1991 Scott's notes were used by Warner Brothers to create a rushed [[director's cut]] which removed the main character's voiceover and made a number of other small changes, including to the ending. Later Scott personally supervised a digital restoration of ''Blade Runner'' and approved what was called ''The Final Cut''. This version was released in Los Angeles, New York City and [[Toronto]] cinemas on 5 October 2007, and as an elaborate DVD release in December 2007.<ref name=bladerunner2007>[http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=36328 "''Blade Runner'' Final Cut Due", SciFi Wire, 26 May 2006]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> Today, ''Blade Runner'' is ranked by many critics as one of the most important and influential science fiction films yet made,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/news/page/0,12983,1290764,00.html |title=',The Guardian',: Top 10 sci-fi films |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=6 March 2010 }}</ref> partly thanks to its much imitated portraits of a future cityscape. It is often discussed along with [[William Gibson]]'s novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' as initiating the [[cyberpunk]] genre.

==="1984" Apple Macintosh commercial===
{{Main|1984 (advertisement)}}
In 1984 Scott directed a big-budget (US$900,000) television commercial to launch the Apple Macintosh computer. The so-called ''1984'' advertisement was given a showcase airing in the United States on 22 January 1984, during [[Super Bowl XVIII]], alongside screenings in cinemas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duke.edu/~tlove/mac.htm |title=Apple's 1984: The Introduction of the Macintosh in the Cultural History of Personal Computers |publisher=Duke.edu |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> Some consider this advertisement a "watershed event" in advertising<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/kevinmaney/2004-01-28-maney_x.htm |title=Apple's '1984' Super Bowl commercial still stands as watershed event |work=USA Today  |date=28 January 2004 |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> and a "masterpiece".<ref name=masterpiece>{{cite news

===''Legend''===
{{Main|Legend (1985 film)}}
In 1985 Scott directed ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'', a fantasy film produced by [[Arnon Milchan]]. Scott decided to create a "once upon a time" tale set in a world of princesses, unicorns and goblins, filming almost entirely inside the studio. Scott cast [[Tom Cruise]] as the film's hero, Jack, [[Mia Sara]] as Princess Lili and [[Tim Curry]] as the [[Satan]]-horned Lord of Darkness. In the final stages of filming, the forest set was destroyed by fire; [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s original score was used for European release, but replaced in North America with a score by [[Tangerine Dream]]. Rob Bottin provided the film's Academy Award-nominated make-up effects, most notably Curry's red-coloured Satan figure. Though a major commercial failure on release, the film has gone on to become a [[cult classic]]. The 2002 Director's Cut restored Goldsmith's original score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/as-snow-white-the-huntsman-hits-theaters-5-more-fractured-fairytale-movies-20120531?page=2 |title=5 Fractured Fairy Tale Movies Worth Watching After 'Snow White and the Huntsman' |publisher=Blogs.indiewire.com |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>

==Subsequent films==

===1987–1992===
Scott made ''[[Someone to Watch Over Me (film)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]'', a romantic thriller starring [[Tom Berenger]] and [[Mimi Rogers]] in 1987, and ''[[Black Rain (1989 American film)|Black Rain]]'' (1989), a police drama starring [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Andy García]], shot partially in Japan. Both achieved mild success at the box office.

Road film ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'' (1991) starring [[Geena Davis]] as Thelma, and [[Susan Sarandon]] as Louise, proved to be one of Scott's biggest critical successes, helping revive the director's reputation and receiving his first nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. His next project, independently-funded historical epic ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'', was a box office failure. The film recounts the discovery of the Americas by [[Christopher Columbus]] (French star [[Gérard Depardieu]]). Scott did not release another film for four years.

===1993–1999===
In 1995 Ridley and his brother Tony formed a production company, Scott Free Productions, in Los Angeles. All Ridley's subsequent feature films, starting with ''[[White Squall (film)|White Squall]]'' and ''[[G.I. Jane]]'' have been produced under the Scott Free banner. In 1995 the two brothers purchased a controlling interest in [[Shepperton Studios]], which later merged with [[Pinewood Studios]].

Scott and his brother have produced CBS series ''[[Numb3rs]]'' (2005–10), a crime drama about a genius mathematician who helps the FBI solve crimes, and ''[[The Good Wife (TV series)|The Good Wife]]'' (2009–), a legal drama about an attorney balancing her job with her husband, a former state attorney trying to rebuild his political career after a major scandal. The two Scotts also produced a 2010 [[The A-Team (film)|film adaptation]] of 1980s television show ''[[The A-Team]]'', directed by [[Joe Carnahan]].

===2000–2005===
Scott's film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000) proved to be one of his biggest critical and commercial successes to date. It won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, for the film's star [[Russell Crowe]]. Some have credited ''Gladiator '' with reviving the nearly defunct "[[sword and sandal]]" historical genre. Scott then turned to ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), a sequel to [[Jonathan Demme]]'s ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''—the film was commercially successful despite receiving mixed reviews—and then to ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'', based on a group of stranded American soldiers fighting for their lives in [[Somalia]]. Scott received two more nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' and ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]''.

In 2003 Scott directed a smaller scale project, ''[[Matchstick Men]]'', adapted from the novel by [[Eric Garcia]] and starring [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Sam Rockwell]] and [[Alison Lohman]]. It received mostly positive reviews, but performed moderately at the box office. In 2005 he made the modestly successful ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'', a film about the [[Crusades]]. The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mooviees.com/9136/1804-production_notes|title=''Mooviess.com'' Kingdom of Heaven production notes}}</ref>

Unhappy with the theatrical version of the film (which he blamed on paying too much attention to the opinions of preview audiences), Scott supervised a director's cut of ''Kingdom of Heaven'', which was released on DVD in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingdomofheavendvd.com|title=''Kingdom of Heaven: Director's Cut'' DVD official website}}</ref> Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: "It depends who's in the driving seat. If you've got a lunatic doing my job, then you need to preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version to go out into the cinema."<ref name="totalfilm">''Total Film'' magazine, July 2006: 'Three hours, eight minutes. It's beautiful.' (Interview to promote ''Kingdom of Heaven: The Director's Cut'')</ref>

===2006–present===
Scott teamed up again with ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' star [[Russell Crowe]], for ''[[A Good Year]]'', based on the best-selling book by [[Peter Mayle]] about an investment banker who finds a new life in [[Provence]]. The film was released on 10 November 2006. A few days later [[Rupert Murdoch]], chairman of studio [[20th Century Fox]] (who backed the film) dismissed ''A Good Year'' as "a flop" at a shareholders' meeting.<ref>{{cite news | title=A Good Year is a 'flop', Murdoch admits | date=16 November 2006 | url =http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1949283,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate=24 February 2007 }}</ref>

Scott's next film was ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'', based on the story of real-life drug kingpin [[Frank Lucas (drug dealer)|Frank Lucas]]. He was the third director to join the project after [[Antoine Fuqua]] and [[Terry George]]. [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Benicio del Toro]] had initially been cast, both actors having been paid salaries of $20&nbsp;m and $15&nbsp;m respectively without the film having gone into production. Scott took over the project in early 2006. He had [[Steven Zaillian]] rewrite his script to focus on the dynamic between Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. Washington signed back on to the project as Lucas, with Russell Crowe co-starring. The film finally premiered in November 2007 to positive reviews and good box office. In late 2008 Scott released espionage [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] ''[[Body of Lies (film)|Body of Lies]]'' starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and Crowe once again, which opened to luke-warm ticket-sales and mixed reviews.

Scott directed a revisionist adaptation of ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'', which starred [[Russell Crowe]] as Robin Hood and [[Cate Blanchett]] as [[Maid Marian]]. It was released in the United States in May 2010 to mixed reviews, but a respectable box-office.

On 31 July 2009, news surfaced of a two-part prequel to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17890 |title=Ridley Scott Talks 'Alien' Prequel and Timeline |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> with Scott attached to direct.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/apr/27/ridley-scott-alien-prequels-3d |work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Ridley Scott plans two-part Alien prequel | first=Ben | last=Child | date=27 April 2010 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> The project, ultimately reduced to a single film called ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'', which Scott described as sharing "strands of ''Alien'''s DNA" while not being a direct prequel, was released in June 2012. The film received mostly positive reviews and grossed $403&nbsp;million at the box office. A sequel is in development for 2016.

In 2009, the TV Series ''[[The Good Wife]]'' premiered with Ridley Scott and his brother [[Tony Scott]] credited as executive producers.

On 6 July 2010, YouTube announced the launch of ''[[Life in a Day (YouTube)|Life in a Day]]'', an experimental documentary executive produced by Scott. Released at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on 27 January 2011, it incorporates footage shot on 24 July 2010 submitted by YouTube users from around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/07/life-in-day.html |title=Life in a Day |publisher=The Official YouTube Blog |date=6 July 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, Ridley Scott produced the commercial for [[Lady Gaga]]'s upcoming fragrance, "[[Lady Gaga Fame|Fame]]." It has been touted as the first ever black Eau de Parfum. This was announced in the informal credits attached to the trailer for this advertisement. Scott directed ''[[The Counselor]]'' (2013), with a screenplay by author [[Cormac McCarthy]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike|title=Ridley Scott in Talks For Cormac McCarthy's 'The Counselor'|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/ridley-scott-in-talks-for-cormac-mccarthys-the-counselor/|publisher=Deadline}}</ref><ref name="FirstImage">{{cite web |url=http://www.ineedmyfix.com/2012/08/01/first-looks-at-michael-fassbender-and-brad-pitt-filming-the-counselor |title=First Looks at Michael Fassbender and Brad Pitt Filming 'The Counselor' |publisher=INeedMyFix.com |date=1 August 2012 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>

In November 2012 it was announced that Scott would produce the upcoming documentary, ''[[Springsteen & I]]'' which will be directed by [[Baillie Walsh]] and was inspired by ''Life in a Day'', which Scott also produced. The film will feature fan footage from throughout the world on what musician [[Bruce Springsteen]] means to them and how he has impacted their lives. The film will be released for one day only in 50 countries and on over 2000 film screens on 22 July 2013.

In March 2013, Twentieth Century Fox optioned the film rights for the novel ''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]]'', and hired screenwriter [[Drew Goddard]] to adapt and direct the film.<ref name=alter>{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304558804579375161461671196 |title=A Survival Guide to Mars |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Alexandra |last=Alter |date=14 February 2014 |accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=sneider>{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/awards/column-post/drew-goddard-negotiations-write-direct-martian-fox-exclusive-91896 |title=Drew Goddard in Negotiations to Write and Direct 'The Martian' for Fox (Exclusive) |work=The Wrap |first=Jeff |last=Sneider |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref> In May 2014, it was reported that Scott was in negotiations to direct an adaptation that would star [[Matt Damon]] as Mark Watney.<ref name=holl>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/ridley-scott-direct-matt-damon-703887 |title=Ridley Scott in Talks to Direct Matt Damon in 'The Martian' (Exclusive) |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> The film is scheduled for release on 25 November 2015.<ref name=firstshow>{{cite news|last1=Anderton|first1=Ethan|title=Fox Shifts Release Dates for 'The Martian,' 'Miss Peregrine' & More|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2014/fox-shifts-release-dates-for-the-martian-miss-peregrine-more/|accessdate=2 August 2014|publisher=firstshowing.net|date=1 August 2014}}</ref>

On 24 June 2013 Ridley Scott's series "Crimes of the Century" debuted on CNN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2013/tv/news/cnns-newest-series-brings-filmmaker-ridley-scott-to-sundays-1200491234/ |title=CNN's Newest Series Brings Filmmaker Ridley Scott To Sundays |work=Variety  |date=3 June 2013 |accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref>

On 25 October 2013, ''Indiewire'' reported the opening of Scott's latest film ''The Counselor'' stating that, "Before McCarthy sold his first spec script for Scott's (''Counselor'') film, the director was heavily involved in developing an adaptation of the author's 1985 novel "[[Blood Meridian]]" with screenwriter Bill Monahan ("The Departed"). But as Scott said in a ''Time Out'' interview, '[Studios] didn't want to make it. The book is so uncompromising, which is what's great about it.' Described as an "anti-western,"<ref>''Indiewire'', 25 October 2013.</ref>

In December 2014, Ridley Scott released the [[List of films based on the Bible|biblically-inspired]] [[epic film]] ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]''.

==On-going projects==

In October 2008, Scott confirmed that after a 25-year wait for the rights to become available, he was to make an adaptation of the book ''[[The Forever War]]'' by [[Joe Haldeman]]. He was looking for a script writer.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/13/ridley-scott-forever-war |work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Ridley Scott puts off Brave New World for The Forever War | first=Ben | last=Child | date=13 October 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> The following March, he confirmed that the film would be in 3D, citing [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' as an inspiration for this. "I'm filming a book by Joe Haldeman called ''Forever War''. I've got a good writer doing it. I've seen some of James Cameron's work and I've got to go 3D.

In August 2011, information leaked about production of a sequel to ''[[Blade Runner]]'' by [[Alcon Entertainment]], with Alcon partners [[Broderick Johnson]] and [[Andrew Kosove]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/ridley-scott-ready-to-direct-new-version-of-seminal-sci-fi-film-blade-runner/ |title=Ridley Scott To Direct New 'Blade Runner' Installment For Alcon Entertainment | publisher =Deadline New York |date=19 August 2011 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref> Scott informed the ''Variety'' publication in November 2014 that he was no longer the director for the film and would only fulfill a producer's role. Scott also revealed that filming would begin sometime within 2015, and that [[Harrison Ford]] has signed on to reprise his role from the original film but his character should only appear in "the third act" of the sequel.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jacob Kastrenakes|title=Ridley Scott won't direct 'Blade Runner' sequel|url=http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/25/7286991/blade-runner-2-wont-be-directed-by-ridley-scott|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media, Inc|accessdate=26 November 2014|date=25 November 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Ridley Scott was married to Felicity Heywood from 1964 to 1975. The couple had two sons, [[Jake Scott (director)|Jake]] and Luke, both of whom work as directors on Scott's production company, Ridley Scott Associates. Scott later married advertising executive Sandy Watson in 1979, with whom he had a daughter, [[Jordan Scott]], and divorced in 1989.<ref>{{IMDb name|779386|Jordan Scott}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb name|631|section=bio}}</ref> His current partner is the actress [[Giannina Facio]], whom he has cast in all his films since ''[[White Squall (film)|White Squall]]'' except ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]''."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2616075.stm "Sir Ridley Scott: Hollywood visionary"]. BBC. Retrieved 8 December 2012.</ref> He divides his time between homes in London, France and Los Angeles.

Scott received a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] in honour of his substantial contribution to the British film industry, from the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 8 July 2003.<ref name="knighted"/> Scott admitted feeling "stunned and truly humbled" after the ceremony, saying, "As a boy growing up in [[South Shields]], I could never have imagined that I would receive such a special recognition. I am truly humbled to receive this treasured award and believe it also further recognises the excellence of the British film industry."<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-153145/Film-director-Ridley-tops-showbiz-honours-list.html "Film director Ridley tops showbiz honours list"]. @MailOnline. Retrieved 8 December 2012.</ref>

His eldest brother Frank died, aged 45, of skin cancer in 1980.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/hollywood-pays-tribute-to-top-gun-director-tony-scott-following-suicide-leap-8062363.html | title= Hollywood pays tribute to Top Gun director Tony Scott following suicide leap | first1= Tom | last1= Harper |first2= Louise | last2= Jury | date= 20 August 2012 | newspaper= [[London Evening Standard]] | accessdate= 5 September 2012 }}</ref> His younger brother [[Tony Scott|Tony]], who was also his business partner in their company Scott Free, died on 19 August 2012 after jumping from the [[Vincent Thomas Bridge]] which spans Los Angeles Harbor.

The two-part miniseries premiered on A&E on 3 September 2012, to mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/coma|title=Coma – Reviews, Ratings, Credits and More|date=31 August 2012|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> In 2013 Ridley stated that he is an [[atheist]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Sternbergh | first = Adam | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/magazine/ridley-scott-most-novelists-are-desperate-to-do-what-i-do.html?smid=tw-nytimes&_r=1& | title = Ridley Scott: ‘Most Novelists Are Desperate to Do What I Do’ | date = 25 October 2013 | accessdate = 26 October 2013 | work = The New York Times }}</ref>

Ridley has dedicated several of his films in memory of his family: ''[[Blade Runner]]'' to his brother Frank, ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' to his mother, and ''[[The Counselor]]'' and ''[[Exodus: Gods and Kings]]'' to his brother Tony.

==Approach and style==
Russell Crowe commented, "I like being on Ridley's set because actors can perform [...] and the focus is on the performers."<ref name="gangster">''American Gangster'' DVD, ''Fallen Empire: The Making of American Gangster'' documentary</ref> Paul M. Sammon, in his book ''Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner'', commented in an interview with Brmovie.com that Scott's relationship with his actors has improved considerably over the years.<ref>{{cite web|first=David |last=Caldwell |url=http://www.brmovie.com/Articles/Sammon_Interview_11.htm |title=Paul M. Sammon interview |publisher=BRmovie.com |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref> More recently during the filming of Scott's 2012 film, ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'', [[Charlize Theron]] praised the director's willingness to listen to suggestions from the cast for improvements in the way their characters are portrayed on script. Theron worked alongside the writers and Scott to give more depth to her character during filming.<ref name="Prometheus_Theron">{{cite news | url=http://movies.inquirer.net/3843/%E2%80%9Cprometheus%E2%80%9D-crew-on-a-mission-collision | title="Prometheus" Crew: On A Mission Collision |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer | date=29 April 2012 |accessdate=7 May 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

His striking visual style, incorporating a detailed approach to production design and innovative, atmospheric lighting, has been influential on a subsequent generation of filmmakers&nbsp;– many of whom have imitated his style.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Scott commonly uses slow pacing until the action sequences. Examples include ''Alien'' and ''Blade Runner''; the ''LA Times'' critic Sheila Benson, for example, would call the latter "Blade Crawler" "because it's so damn slow". Another technique he employs is use of sound or music to build tension, as heard in ''Alien'', with hissing steam, beeping computers and the noise of the machinery in the space ship. Scott claims to have an [[Eidetic Memory]], which he says aids him in visualising and storyboarding the scenes in his films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/ridley-scott-magic-comes-over-the-horizon-every-day/ |title=Ridley Scott: ‘Magic comes over the horizon every day’ &#124; Hero Complex – movies, comics, pop culture|work=Los Angeles Times |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>

Scott has developed a method for filming intricate shots as swiftly as possible: "I like working, always, with a minimum of three cameras. [...] So those 50 set-ups [a day] might only be 25 set-ups except I'm covering in the set-up. So you're finished. I mean, if you take a little bit more time to prep on three cameras, or if it's a big stunt, eleven cameras, and&nbsp;– whilst it may take 45 minutes to set up&nbsp;– then when you're ready you say 'Action!', and you do three takes, two takes and is everybody happy? You say, 'Yeah, that's it.' So you move on."<ref name="gangster"/>

Although Scott is often known for his [[painterly]] directorial style, other techniques and elements include:

* [[Artificial intelligence]] is a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, particularly in ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''Prometheus''.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 121-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref> The recent book ''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'' identifies [[Alan Turing]] and [[John Searle]], a professor at the University of California, as presenting relevant models of testing artificial intelligence known as the [[Turing test]] and the [[Chinese Room]] Thought Experiment, respectively, in the chapter titled "What's Wrong with Building Replicants," which has been a recurring theme for many of Scott's films.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 136-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref> The chapter titled "Artificial Intelligence in ''Blade Runner'', ''Alien'', and ''Prometheus''," concludes by citing the writings of [[John Stuart Mill]] in the context of Scott's Nexus-6 Replicants in ''Blade Runner'' (Rutger Hauer), the android Ash (Ian Holm) in ''Alien'', and the android David (Michael Fassbender) in ''Prometheus'', where Mill is applied to assert that measures and tests of intelligence must also assess actions and moral behaviour in androids to effectively address the themes which Scott explores in these films.<ref>''The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott'', p. 140-142, Lexington Books, 2013.</ref> 
* Scott seems to use extreme levels of lighting in his films. ''Blade Runner'' is, for the most part, dark and dingy, whereas ''Thelma & Louise'', for the most part, is bright, sunny and happy.
* Strong female characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800015105/bio |title=Yahoo! Movies: Ridley Scott |publisher=Yahoo! |date=30 November 1937 |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americancinematheque.com/pressreleases/2001/ridleyscott.htm |title=AmericanCinemateque.com: Press release |publisher=Americancinematheque.com |accessdate=6 March 2010}}</ref>
* Some of his films feature strong conflicts between father and son that usually end with the latter killing the former (''Blade Runner'', ''Gladiator'') or witnessing the event (''Kingdom of Heaven'', ''Robin Hood''). The Lord of Darkness in ''Legend'' also mentions his "father" on a few occasions. As part of the conflict between father and son there are some repetitive scenes: in ''Gladiator'', the son hugs the father seemingly as an expression of love but this embrace turns into the suffocation and death of the father. There is a similar sequence in ''Blade Runner''. In ''Prometheus'', the character David says "Doesn't everyone want their parents dead?"
* Scott uses cityscapes as an emphasis to his storytelling (e.g., a futuristic Los Angeles in ''Blade Runner'', Osaka in ''Black Rain'', Jerusalem in ''Kingdom of Heaven'').
* In ''Gladiator'', ''Blade Runner'' and ''Kingdom of Heaven'', a son gets to know his father when he is grown up. Other common elements are that the mother is not seen, and that the son or father is seen performing his last actions. For example, Roy Batty is dying when he saves Deckard, Maximus dies after killing Commodus and Godfrey of Ibelin kills some enemies after he has been mortally wounded by an arrow. In addition, the hero is saved from death before attaining his greatest deeds: Deckard is saved by Rachel, Maximus is saved by a slave and Balian is saved by a Muslim enemy. Similar situations can be seen in Tony Scott's ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]]''.
* Military and officer classes as characters reflecting his father's career, such as in ''G.I. Jane'', ''Gladiator'', ''Black Hawk Down'', ''Kingdom of Heaven'', ''Robin Hood'' and ''Prometheus''.
* Storyboarding his films extensively. These illustrations, when made by himself, have been referred to as "Ridleygrams" in DVD releases.
* Scott was once known for requesting a great many takes. This was evident on ''Blade Runner'': the crew nicknamed the movie "Blood Runner" because of this.
* He often makes use of classical music (the Hovis advertisements, ''Someone to Watch Over Me'').
* Extensive use of smoke and other atmospheres (in ''Alien'', ''Blade Runner'' and ''Black Rain''), plus fans and fan-like objects (''Blade Runner'', ''Black Rain'' and the large Boeing jet engines in the "1984" TV advertisement). Fans are also used in ''Hannibal'', for symbolic purposes.
* Consistency in his choice of composers, using [[Jerry Goldsmith]] (''Alien'' and ''Legend''), [[Vangelis]] (''Blade Runner'' and ''1492: Conquest of Paradise''), [[Hans Zimmer]] (''Black Rain'', ''Thelma & Louise'', ''Gladiator'', ''Hannibal'', ''Black Hawk Down'' and ''Matchstick Men'') or [[Marc Streitenfeld]] (''A Good Year'', ''American Gangster'', ''Body of Lies'', ''Robin Hood'' and ''Prometheus''). Scott has also twice used songs by Sting during the film credits ("Valparaiso" for ''White Squall'' and "Someone to Watch Over Me" for the movie of the same title).
* In his recent films, he often shoots at fast [[shutter speeds]] for a "staccato" look during action scenes (''Gladiator'', ''Black Hawk Down'', ''Kingdom of Heaven'', ''Robin Hood'').

==DVD format and director's cut==
Scott is known for his enthusiasm for the DVD format, providing [[Audio commentary (DVD)|audio commentaries]] and interviews for all his films where possible. In the July 2006 issue of ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine, he stated: "After all the work we go through, to have it run in the cinema and then disappear forever is a great pity. To give the film added life is really cool for both those who missed it and those who really loved it."<ref name="totalfilm"/>

Running alongside his enthusiasm for DVD, Scott is sometimes considered the "father" of the [[director's cut]]. The positive reaction to the ''Blade Runner'' Director's Cut encouraged Scott to re-cut several movies that were a disappointment at the time of their release (including ''Legend'' and ''Kingdom of Heaven''). Today the practice of alternative cuts is more commonplace, though often as a way to make a film stand out in the DVD marketplace by adding new material.
