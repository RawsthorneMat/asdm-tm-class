In 1931 her eyes were insured by [[Lloyd's of London]] for $100,000.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} After a small part in ''Union Station'' (1932), Dennett appeared with her father on stage at the Hillstreet Theater in [[Los Angeles, California]].

===Minor film actress===

After playing ''Daisy, the girl of the pavements'' in ''Union Station'', she was given a contract for two additional films by [[Warner Bros.]]. She next depicted an [[ingenue (stock character)]] in the ''The Tinsel Girl'' (1932), a film directed by [[Michael Curtiz]]. This was followed by her portrayal of ''Tart'' in ''Two Seconds'' (1932). This screen crime drama starred [[Edward G. Robinson]] and was directed by [[Mervyn Leroy]].

From the mid-1930s Dennett acted small parts in ''The Merry Widow'' (1934), ''Men In White'' (1934), ''One More Spring'' (1935), ''The Devil Is A Woman'' (1935), ''Dramatic School'' (1938), ''Broadway Serenade'' (1939),  ''Stardust'' (1940), ''Manhattan Heartbeat'' (1940), ''Street of Memories'' (1940), and ''The Cowboy and the Blonde'' (1941).

The other entertainment was provided by the screening of the [[W.C. Fields]] movie, ''Old-Fashioned Way'' (1934). Dennett shared the bill with thirty other players including Frank Gallagher, Bobby Dale, Helen Wright, and Dorothy Castleman. The presentation of ''Peggy-Ann'' was enlivened by dancing and singing choruses. Audiences were pleased and the show was repeated four times a day on some days.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}
