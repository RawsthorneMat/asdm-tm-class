Prior to this she studied at the Ursula Academy.<ref name=early/> May won a scholarship to do post-graduate work. Her father was opposed to her doing any type of acting, so she waited until after his death to pursue this venture. She went back to the dramatic school after a dissatisfying stay of three months in [[California]].<ref name=wark/> Her first roles were minor parts in the productions of [[Samuel Goldwyn]] and [[Famous Players-Lasky]].<ref name=early>''Morosco's..Latest..Find'', Los Angeles Times, August 13, 1922, pg.

In ''The Half Breed'' (1922) May is paired with [[Wheeler Oakman]] in a western produced by [[Oliver Morosco]]. The daring scenes she performed in this movie showed her talent as a performer. As an actress she was diverse enough to play a daring rider or a delicate society girl from the east.<ref>''Shoot Climax For Half Breed'', Los Angeles Times, April 10, 1921, pg. III17.</ref> One film critic questioned why May was not a bigger star in her profession.

She was forced to stop working for several days until her arm healed.<ref>''Actress Injures Arm'', Los Angeles Times, May 11, 1924, pg. 24.</ref>

In ''The Fighting Cub''<ref name=cub>''Fighting Cub Depicts Thrills of News Gutting'', Los Angeles Times, January 31, 1926, pg. 31.</ref> May has the leading feminine role in a feature about a cub reporter.

A petition filed in a Cincinnati Federal Court in September 1921 revealed that May was the beneficiary of an insurance policy taken out by E.M. Noel, a wealthy oil man who died in Cincinnati in January 1920. It was disclosed that Noel purchased two automobiles, jewelry, and advanced large sums of money, amounting to $30,000, to May. One of the cars had been recovered from May with the lawyer's advice. The $75,000 insurance benefit to May was cancelled by Noel upon the attorney's persuasion.<ref name=birth/>
