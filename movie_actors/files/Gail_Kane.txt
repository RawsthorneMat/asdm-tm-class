She stood 5'7" tall, weighed 142 pounds, and had dark brown hair and eyes. She attended a private school in [[Newburgh, New York]], but eschewed additional education to become an actress. She became a dedicated student of the art of [[pantomime]].

==Theatrical actress==
Kane performed at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in ''Heap Game Watch'' in January 1914. She had a significant role in ''Seven Keys To Baldpate Astor'', which was staged at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], in May 1914. The comedy was brought to the stage by [[George M. Cohan]]. She paired with George Nash in ''The Miracle Man'' at the [[Astor Theatre]]. The play was produced on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in the fall of 1914.

Kane acted in a presentation of ''The Hyphen Knickerbocker'' in April 1915. She returned to the stage at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] in July 1920. She was paired with [[Earle Fox]], another actor who had been spending much of his time in movies. They appeared in the comedy ''Come Seven''. The production was an adaptation by [[Octavus Roy Cohen]] of stories he had contributed to ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. The play was the first ever featuring an entirely [[Caucasian race|caucasian]] cast in [[black face]].

''Lawful Larceny'' (1922) was a comedy adapted from the writing of Samuel Shipman. It was presented at the Republic Theater, built by [[Oscar Hammerstein I|Oscar Hammerstein]] in 1900, at [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]. The players included Kane, Margaret Lawrence, Ida Waterman, and [[Lowell Sherman]].

''The Breaking Point'' by [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]] was staged at the [[Klaw Theatre]], West 45th Street, [[New York City]], in August 1923. The plot concerned [[amnesia]] with the [[setting (fiction)]] moving from New York to [[Wyoming]] and back. Kane, Regina Wallace, [[Reginald Barlow]], and McKay Morris were the principal actors in the drama.

She played Ellen Halpin in the 1925 comedy ''[[Loggerheads (play)|Loggerheads]]'' at the [[Cherry Lane Theatre]]. The [[Booth Theatre]] produced ''Paid'', written by Sam Forrest, in November 1925. Kane portrayed ''Mrs John Ramsey'' in a play which endured for twenty-one performances.

==Arrest==
Kane was arrested following a performance of ''The Captive'' at the [[Empire Theatre (41st Street)|Empire Theater]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in February 1927. The production was considered indecent and a violation of Section 1140A of the New York City Criminal Code, although the play had been tried and acquitted of immorality a short time earlier by a citizen's play jury. It was in its fifth month of production.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Forty-one arrests were made in total. Two other productions were raided on the same night. They were ''Sex'', playing at Daly's 63rd St. Theater, and ''The Virgin Man'', which was being performed before an audience at the Princess Theater. Among the actors taken to Night Court were [[Basil Rathbone]], [[Helen Menken]], Ann Trevor, Winifred Fraser, John Miltern, and Arthur Lewis. Menken was comforted by Kane as she made her exit after becoming agitated by the glares and explosions of cameras snapping as she stepped out on the sidewalk. "Please make them stop," Menken reportedly exclaimed. Also arrested was [[Mae West]], the star of ''Sex'', and twenty others among a cast of fifty. Authorities promised to repeat the arrests if the plays were not withdrawn or modified to comply with the criminal code. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Movie career==
Kane's movie career spanned much of the silent era, beginning with a role as ''Bonita Canby'', in ''Arizona'' (1913). In the western she had the third lead, portraying the unfaithful wife of a [[U.S. Cavalry]] officer. She co-starred as Jurgis Rudkus's (played by George Nash) wife Ona Lukoszaite in the film adaptation of [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle (1914 film)|The Jungle]]'' (1914). She starred in ''Via Wireless'' (1915) which was adapted from a play by [[Winchell Smith]] and Paul Armstrong. The story describes the competition between two men in the invention of a new naval gun. A wealthy man becomes the rival of one of the inventors for the affection of the daughter of an [[ironmaster]]. As ''Frances Durant'', Kane is finally given a part worthy of her skill as an actress. One critic described her as ''a diamond set in brass'' in her previous films. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Kane was employed by the [[Mutual Film Corporation]] of [[Santa Barbara, California]] when she made ''The Upper Crust'' (1917). Produced by Mutual-American, Edward Pell is cast as Kane's [[leading man]] in a comedy replete with humor. Kane is a young [[Irish people|Irish]] woman named ''Molly O'Toole''. She impersonates a wealthy [[dowager]] and succeeds in her [[deception|ruse]] long enough to enjoy herself and eventually marry the dowager's son.  

In July 1917 Kane joined an effort organized by William A. Brady, President of the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry, and [[D.W. Griffith]]. Their task was to utilize film as a tool of information regarding the ''plans and purposes'' of the [[United States]] in [[World War I]]. Brady was appointed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to mobilize the motion-picture industry. Kane was assigned to the Food Commission. In addition to Mutual she was associated with [[Metro Pictures]], [[Pathé]], and World. Kane filed a suit against Mutual in 1918, asking $33,500 for alleged [[breach of contract]].  {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

''The Scarlet Oath'' (1917) was a challenging movie for Kane who played the dual role of two women. ''A Game of Wits'' (1917) is a five-reel comedy with Kane portraying ''Jeannette Browning'' in a unique love story. 

She continued to act in motion pictures for another decade. Among her later movies are ''Love's Law'' (1918), ''The Daredevil'' (1918), ''Someone Must Pay'' (1919), ''Romeo's Dad'' (1919), ''Empty Arms'' (1920), ''Idle Hands'' (1921), ''[[The White Sister (1923 film)|The White Sister]]'' (1923), and ''Convoy'' (1927).

==Marriage==
Kane's husband, Henry Iden Ottman, died in January 1939. Ottman was born in New York City in 1880, the son of William Ottman and Christine Iden. Ottman moved to [[Augusta, Maine]] in 1921. Kane and Ottman had a son, William Kane Ottman.

==Private life==
She owned a collection of [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]] beetles considered to be one of the finest in America in 1917. The most valuable of the [[Scarabaeus sacer]] is said to have been removed from the tomb of an [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egyptian]] princess of the 2nd [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. Archaeologists believe it to be one of a number issued to illustrate the doctrine of the resurrection. Kane was given her first scarab by [[Howard Estabrook]], who played ''Adhemar de Gratignan'' in ''Divorcons'' (1913). Presented at the New York Playhouse, Kane portrayed ''Mme. de Brionne'' in the play written by the [[France|French]] dramatist [[Victorien Sardou]]. Estabrook purchased the scarab in [[India]] while he was touring. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

She collected bathing suits. Kane possessed one of the most attractive collections of one-piece, two-piece, and ''fluffy ruffles seashore outfits'' in [[Chicago, Illinois]] by 1917. Each bathing suit was also designed by her.

==Death==
Gail Kane died in [[Augusta, Maine]] in 1966, aged 80.
