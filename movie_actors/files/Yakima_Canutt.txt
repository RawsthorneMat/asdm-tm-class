'''Yakima Canutt''' (November 29, 1895 &ndash; May 24, 1986), also known as '''Yak Canutt''', was an [[United States|American]] champion [[rodeo|rodeo rider]], [[actor]], [[stunt double|stuntman]] and action [[second unit director|director]].

==Biography==
Born '''Enos Edward Canutt''' in the Snake River Hills, near [[Colfax, Washington]], he was one of five children of John Lemuel Canutt, a rancher, and Nettie Ellen Stevens. He grew up in eastern Washington on a ranch near [[Penawawa Creek]], founded by his grandfather and operated by his father, who also served a term in the state legislature. His formal education was limited to elementary school in Green Lake, Washington, then a suburb of Seattle. He gained the education for his life's work on the family ranch, where he learned to hunt, trap, shoot, and ride.<ref name="Gale">World Bio. 2001.</ref>

He broke a wild bronco when he was 11. As a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} sixteen-year-old, he started bronc riding at the Whitman County Fair in Colfax in 1912, and at 17 he won the title of World's Best Bronco Buster. Canutt started rodeo riding professionally and gained a reputation as a bronc rider, [[Steer wrestling|bulldogger]] and all-around cowboy. It was at the 1914 [[Pendleton Round-Up]], [[Pendleton, Oregon]] he got the nickname "Yakima" when a newspaper caption misidentified him.<ref name="Canutt">Canutt. 1979.</ref> "Yakima Canutt may be the most famous person NOT from Yakima, Washington" says Elizabeth Gibson, author of ''Yakima, Washington''.<ref>Gibson. 2002.</ref> Winning second place at the 1915 Pendleton Round-Up brought attention from show promoters, who invited him to compete around the country.<ref name="Canutt"/>

<blockquote>"I started in major rodeos in 1914, and went through to 1923. There was quite a crop of us traveling together, and we would have special railroad cars and cars for the horses. We'd play anywhere from three, six, eight ten-day shows. Bronc riding and bulldogging were my specialties, but I did some roping," said Canutt.<ref name="Baxter">Baxter. 1974</ref></blockquote>

During the 1916 season, he became interested in divorcee [[Kitty Canutt|Kitty Wilks]], who had won the Lady's Bronc-Riding Championship a couple of times. They married on July 20, 1917, while at a show in Kalispell, Montana; he was 21 and she 23.  They divorced about 1922.<ref name="Canutt"/> While bulldogging in Idaho, Canutt's mouth and upper lip were torn by a bull's horn; after stitches, Canutt returned to the competition. It was not until a year later that a plastic surgeon could correct the injury.<ref name="Canutt"/>

===World's champion===
Canutt won his first world championship at the Olympics of the West in 1917 and won more championships in the next few years.  In between rodeos, he broke horses for the French government in [[World War I]].<ref name="latimes1960">LA Times, April 17, 1960</ref> In 1918, he went to Spokane to enlist in the [[United States Navy]] and was stationed in Bremerton. In the fall, he was given a 30-day furlough to defend his rodeo title. He was discharged in spring 1919. At the 1919 [[Calgary Stampede]], he competed in the bucking event and met [[Pete Knight (rodeo)|Pete Knight]].<ref name="Canutt"/>

He traveled to Los Angeles for a rodeo, and decided to winter in Hollywood, where he met screen personalities.<ref name="Baxter"/> It was here that [[Tom Mix]], who had also started in rodeos, invited him to be in two of his pictures.<ref name="Canutt"/> Mix added to his flashy wardrobe by borrowing two of Canutt's two-tone shirts and having his tailor make 40 copies.<ref name="Baxter"/> Canutt got his first taste of stunt work in a fight scene on a serial called ''Lightning Bryce'';{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} he left Hollywood to compete in the 1920 rodeo circuit.

The Fort Worth rodeo was nicknamed "Yak's show" after he won the saddle-bronc competition three years in a row from 1921 to 1923.  He had won the saddle-bronc competition in Pendleton in 1917, 1919, and 1923 and came second in 1915 and 1929. Canutt won the steer bulldogging in 1920 and 1921, and won the All-Around Police Gazette belt in 1917, 1919, 1920 and 1923.<ref name="Canutt"/> While in Hollywood in 1923 for an awards ceremony, he was offered eight western action pictures for producer Ben Wilson at Burwillow Studios; the first was to be ''Riding Mad''.

===Actor===
Canutt had been perfecting tricks such as the Crupper Mount, a leapfrog over the horse's rump into the saddle. [[Douglas Fairbanks]] used some in his film ''[[The Gaucho]]''. Fairbanks and Canutt became friends and competed regularly at Fairbanks' gym. Canutt took small parts in pictures to get experience.<ref name="Canutt"/> It was in ''Branded a Bandit'' (1924) that his nose was broken in a 12-foot fall from a cliff. The picture was delayed several weeks, and when it resumed, Canutt's close shots were from the side. A plastic surgeon reset the nose, which healed, inspiring Canutt to remark that he thought it looked better.<ref name="Canutt"/>

===Stuntman===
[[File:Yakima Canutt Stagecoach.jpg|375px|thumb|Yakima in John Ford's ''Stagecoach'' after doing the "transfer" part of his most famous stunt]]
When his contract with Wilson expired in 1927, Canutt was making appearances at rodeos across the country. By 1928, the talkies were coming out, and though he had been in 48 silent pictures, Canutt knew his career was in trouble.<ref name="latimes1960" /> His voice had been damaged from flu in the Navy. He started taking on bit parts and stunts, and realized more could be done with action in pictures.<ref name="Canutt"/>

In 1930, between pictures and rodeoing, Canutt met Minnie Audrea Yeager Rice at a party at her parents' home. She was 12 years his junior. They kept company during the next year while he picked up work on the serials for [[Mascot Pictures Corporation]]. They married on November 12, 1931.<ref name="Canutt"/>

When rodeo riders invaded Hollywood, they brought a battery of rodeo techniques that Canutt would expand and improve, including horse falls and wagon wrecks, along with the harnesses and cable rigs to make the stunts foolproof and safe.<ref name="Baxter"/> Among the new safety devices was the 'L' stirrup, which allowed a man to fall off a horse without getting hung in the stirrup. Canutt also developed cabling and equipment to cause spectacular wagon crashes, while releasing the team, all on the same spot every time.<ref name="Baxter"/> Safety methods such as these saved film-makers time and money and prevented accidents and injury to performers. One of Yakima's inventions was the 'Running W' stunt, bringing down a horse at the gallop by attaching a wire, anchored to the ground, to its fetlocks and launching the rider forwards spectacularly. This either killed the horse, or rendered it badly shaken and unusable for the rest of the day.<ref name="Baxter" /> The 'Running W' is now banned and has been replaced with the falling-horse technique. It is believed that the last time it was used was on the 1983 Iraqi film ''[[al-Mas' Ala Al-Kubra]]'' when British actor and friend of Yak [[Marc Sinden]] and stuntman Ken Buckle (who had been trained by Yak) performed the stunt three times during a cavalry charge sequence.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Greatest Movie Story Never Told| date=July 2012| pages=126–133| publisher=Esquire}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Film Programme interview| date=2011-08-05| publisher=BBC Radio 4| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b012x12w/The_Film_Programme_05_08_2011/| accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>

It was while working on Mascot serials that Canutt practiced and perfected his most famous stunts, including the drop from a stagecoach that he would employ in [[John Ford]]'s  1939 ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]''. That famous stunt in ''Stagecoach'' was filmed near Chimney Rock on Rabbit Dry Lake, west of Lucerne Valley, California. He first did it in ''Riders of the Dawn'' in 1937 while doubling for [[Addison Randall|Jack Randall]].<ref name="Canutt"/> In his 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', [[Steven Spielberg]] paid homage to Canutt, recreating the stunt when stuntman Terry Leonard (doubling for [[Harrison Ford]]) 'dropped' from the front of a German transport truck, was dragged underneath (along a prepared trench) and then climbed up the back and round to the front again.<ref name="Sizemore">{{cite web

[[File:Yakima Canutt Stagecoach underneath.jpg|375px|thumb|Yakima in John Ford's ''Stagecoach'' doing the "drop" part of his most famous stunt]]

===John Wayne===
While at Mascot, Canutt met [[John Wayne]] while doubling for him in a motorcycle stunt for ''[[The Shadow of the Eagle]]'' in 1932. Wayne admired Canutt’s agility and fearlessness, and Canutt respected Wayne’s willingness to learn and attempt his own stunts.<ref name="Kazanjian">Kazanjian. 2007.</ref>  Canutt taught Wayne how to fall off a horse.<ref>''Look'' interview with Wayne 1971.</ref><blockquote>"The two worked together to create a technique that made on-screen fight scenes more realistic. Wayne and Canutt found if they stood at a certain angle in front of the camera, they could throw a punch at an actor’s face and make it look as if actual contact had been made."<ref name="Kazanjian"/></blockquote> Canutt and Wayne pioneered stunt and screen fighting techniques still in use. Much of Wayne's on-screen persona was copied from Canutt. The characterizations associated with Wayne - the drawling, hesitant speech and the hip-rolling walk - were pure Canutt.<ref name="Cody">Cody. 1982. p.91.</ref> Said Wayne, "I spent weeks studying the way Yakima Canutt walked and talked. He was a real cowhand."<ref>Willis. 1997.</ref>

In 1932, Canutt's first son Edward Clay was born and nicknamed '[[Tap Canutt|Tap]]', short for ''[[Tapadero]]'', a Spanish word for a [[stirrup]] covering. It was in 1932 that Canutt broke his shoulder in four places while trying to transfer from horse to wagon team.<ref name="Canutt"/> Though work was scarce, he got by combining stunting and rodeo work.

In 1934, [[Herbert Yates|Herbert J. Yates]] of [[Consolidated Film Industries]] combined [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram]], [[Mascot Pictures Corporation|Mascot]], Liberty, Majestic, Chesterfield, and Invincible Pictures to form [[Republic Pictures]], and Canutt became Republic's top stuntman. He handled all the action on many pictures, including [[Gene Autry]] films; and several series and serials, such as ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' and ''[[Zorro]]''.  For ''[[Zorro Rides Again]]'', Canutt did almost all the scenes in which Zorro wore a mask, and he was on the screen as much as the star [[John Carroll (actor)|John Carroll]].<ref>Glut. 1973.</ref> When the action was indicated in a Republic script, it said "see Yakima Canutt for action sequences."<ref name="Baxter"/>

[[William Witney]], one of Republic's film directors, said: <blockquote>"There will probably never be another stuntman who can compare to Yakima Canutt. He had been a world champion cowboy several times and where horses were concerned he could do it all. He invented all the gadgets that made stunt work easier. One of his clever devices was a step that attached to the saddle so that he had leverage to transfer to another moving object, like a wagon or a train. Another was the “shotgun,” a spring-loaded device used to separate the tongue of a running wagon from the horses, thus cutting the horses loose. It also included a shock cord attached to the wagon bed, which caused wheels to cramp and turn the wagon over on the precise spot that was most advantageous for the camera."<ref name="Whitney">Whitney. 1996.</ref></blockquote>

In the 1936 film ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'', Canutt replaced [[Clark Gable]] in a scene in which a wall was to fall on the star. Canutt said: "We had a heavy table situated so that I could dive under it at the last moment. Just as the wall started down, a girl in the scene became hysterical and panicked. I grabbed her, leaped for the table, but didn't quite make it." The girl was unhurt but he broke six ribs.<ref name="latimes1960" />

===Ramrod===
[[File:Yakima Canutt Stagecoach as Wayne.jpg|375px|thumb|Yakima doubling John Wayne in ''Stagecoach'']]
Canutt tried to get into directing; he was growing older and knew his stunting days were numbered. Harry Joe, Canutt's second son, was born in January 1937. Joe and Tap would become important stuntmen, working with their father.

In 1938, Republic Pictures started expanding into bigger pictures and budgets.  Canutt's mentor and action director for the 1925 ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', [[B. Reeves Eason|Breezy Eason]] was hired as [[second unit director]], and Canutt to coordinate and ramrod the stunts. For Canutt, this meant not only hiring stuntmen and doing some stunts himself, but also laying out the action for the director and writing additional stunts.<ref name="Baxter"/> 
<blockquote>
"In the five years between 1925 and 1930, fifty-five people were killed making movies, and more than ten thousand injured.  By the late 1930s, the maverick stuntman willing to do anything for a buck was disappearing. Now under scrutiny, experienced stunt men began to separate themselves from amateurs by building special equipment, rehearsing stunts, and developing new techniques." – from ''Falling: How Our Greatest Fear Became Our Greatest Thrill'' by Garrett Soden.<ref name="Soden">Soden. 2003</ref></blockquote>

[[John Ford]] hired Canutt on [[John Wayne]]'s recommendation for ''Stagecoach'', where Canutt supervised the river-crossing scene as well as the Indian chase scene, did the stagecoach drop, and doubled for Wayne in the coach stunts. For safety during the stagecoach drop stunt, Canutt devised modified yokes and tongues, to give extra handholds and extra room between the teams.<ref name="Baxter"/> Ford told him that whenever Ford made an action picture and Canutt wasn't working elsewhere, he was on Ford's payroll.<ref name="Canutt"/> Also in 1939, Canutt doubled [[Clark Gable]] in the burning of Atlanta in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''; he also appeared as a renegade accosting Scarlett O'Hara ([[Vivien Leigh]]) as she crosses a bridge in a carriage driving through a shantytown.

===Second unit director===
In 1940, Canutt sustained serious internal injuries when a horse fell on him while doubling for Clark Gable in ''[[Boom Town (film)|Boom Town]]'' (1940). Though in discomfort for months after an operation to repair his bifurcated intestines, he continued to work.<ref name="Canutt"/> Republic's [[Sol Siegel]] offered him the chance to direct the action sequences of ''[[Dark Command]]'', starring Wayne and directed by [[Raoul Walsh]].  For ''Dark Command'', Canutt fashioned an elaborate cable system to yank back the plummeting coach before it fell on the stuntman and horses; he also created a breakaway harness from which they were released before hitting the water.<ref name="gilbert">Gilbert. 1970</ref>

It was in 1943 while doing a low budget [[Roy Rogers]] picture called ''Idaho'' that Canutt broke both his legs at the ankles in a fall off a wagon.<ref name="Canutt"/> He recovered to write the stunts and supervise the action for another Wayne film ''[[In Old Oklahoma]]''. In the next decade, Canutt became one of the best second unit and action directors. MGM brought Canutt to England in 1952 to direct the action and jousting sequences in ''[[Ivanhoe (film)|Ivanhoe]]'' with [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]. This would set a precedent by filming action abroad instead of on the studio lot, and Canutt introduced many British stuntmen to Hollywood-style stunt training.<ref name="Canutt"/> ''Ivanhoe'' was followed by ''[[Knights of the Round Table (film)|Knights of the Round Table]]'', again with director [[Richard Thorpe]] and starring Robert Taylor.  Canutt was again brought in for lavish action scenes in ''[[King Richard and the Crusaders]]''.<ref name="richards">Richards. 1977.</ref>

Canutt directed the close-action scenes for [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Spartacus (1960 film)|Spartacus]]'', spending five days directing retakes that included the slave army rolling its flaming logs into the Romans, and other fight scenes featuring [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Tony Curtis]] and [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]].<ref>Winkler. 2007.</ref>

===Ben Hur===
For ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', Canutt staged the chariot race with nine teams of four horses.  He trained [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Stephen Boyd]] to do their own charioteering. He and his crew spent five months on the race sequence.<ref name="herman">Herman. 1996. p.396</ref> In contrast to the [[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|1925 film]], not one horse was hurt, and no humans were seriously injured; though Joe Canutt, while doubling for Charlton Heston, did cut his chin because he did not follow his father's advice to hook himself to the chariot when Judah Ben-Hur's chariot bounced over the wreck of another chariot.<ref name="heston">Heston. 1995</ref>

===Other===
[[File:Fun of Living Dangerously.jpg|250px|thumb|''Fun of Living Dangerously: the Life of Yakima Canutt'' by Stef Donev]]
[[Walt Disney]] brought Canutt in to do second unit work for ''[[Westward Ho, the Wagons!]]'' in 1956; the first live action [[Western (genre)|Western]] Disney [[feature film]] was followed by ''[[Old Yeller]]'' the next year, and culminated in 1960's ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'', which involved transporting many exotic animals to a remote island in the West Indies.

[[Anthony Mann]] specifically requested Canutt for the second unit for his 1961 ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'', where Canutt directed sons Joe and Tap doubling for [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Christopher Rhodes]] in a stunning tournament joust. "Canutt was surely the most active stager of tournaments since the Middle Ages" – from ''Swordsmen of the Screen.''<ref name="richards" /> He was determined to make the combat scenes in ''El Cid'' the best that had ever been filmed.<ref name="heston">Heston. 1995.</ref> Mann again requested him for 1964's ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]''.  Over the next ten years, Canutt would continue to work, bringing his talents to ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', ''[[Khartoum (film)|Khartoum]]'', ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' and 1970's ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]''.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Yakima Canutt has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1500 Vine Street. In 1967, he was given an [[Honorary Academy Award]] for achievements as a stunt man and for developing safety devices to protect stunt men everywhere. He was inducted into the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] (Hall of Fame).

In 1985, Yakima appeared as himself in "Yak's Best Ride," directed by John Crawford.

Yakima Canutt died of natural causes at the age of 90 in [[North Hollywood, California]]<ref>LA Times May 26, 1986</ref> and is buried there in [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]].
