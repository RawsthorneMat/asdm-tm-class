== Career ==

=== Stage ===
In 1990, Mendes was appointed artistic director of the [[Donmar Warehouse]], a studio space in London's [[Covent Garden]] which he helped transform into one of the city's more notable theatre venues.<ref name="Telegraph">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/8376538/The-Donmars-successes.html "The Donmar's successes"]. ''The Telegraph''. Retrieved 18 June 2012</ref> He spent his first two years overseeing the redesign of the theatre, and his opening production was [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'' in 1992.<ref name="Telegraph"/> Several successful productions followed.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

In 1993, Mendes staged an acclaimed revival of [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]]'s ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' starring [[Jane Horrocks]] as [[Sally Bowles]], [[Alan Cumming]] as Emcee, [[Adam Godley]] as Cliff Bradshaw and [[Sara Kestelman]] as Frau Schneider.<ref name="Telegraph"/> The production was approached with a fresh concept, differing greatly from both the original 1966 production directed by [[Harold Prince]] and the famed film version, directed by [[Bob Fosse]]. This production opened at the Donmar and received four [[Olivier Award]] nominations including Best Musical Revival, before transferring promptly to Broadway where it played for several years at the Kit Kat Club (i.e. the [[Stephen Sondheim Theater]]). The Broadway cast included Cumming once again as Emcee, with [[Natasha Richardson]] as Sally, [[Mary Louise Wilson]] as Frau Schneider and [[John Benjamin Hickey]] as Cliff. Cumming and Richardson won [[Tony Award]]s for their performances.

1994 saw Mendes stage a new production of [[Lionel Bart]]'s ''[[Oliver!]]'', produced by [[Cameron Mackintosh]]. Mendes, a longtime fan of the work, worked in close collaboration with Bart and other production team members, William David Brohn, Martin Koch and Anthony Ward, to create a fresh staging of the well-known classic. Bart added new musical material and Mendes updated the book slightly, while the orchestrations were radically rewritten to suit the show's cinematic feel. The cast included [[Jonathan Pryce]] (after much persuasion) as Fagin, [[Sally Dexter]] as Nancy, and [[Miles Anderson]] as Bill Sikes. Mendes, Pryce and Dexter received [[Olivier Award]] nominations for their work on ''Oliver!''.<ref>[http://www.olivierawards.com/about/previous-winners/view/item98529/olivier-winners-1995/ Olivier Award 1995].  The Society of London Theatre, 2011</ref>

He has also directed productions of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' (which had the first ever African American Bobby), [[Alan Bennett]]'s ''[[Habeas Corpus (play)|Habeas Corpus]]'' and his farewell duo of [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', which transferred to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].<ref name="Telegraph"/>

In 2003, Mendes directed a revival of the musical ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]''. Originally, he planned to stage this production in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] with an eventual Broadway transfer, but when negotiations fell through, he brought it to New York. The cast included [[Bernadette Peters]] as Rose, [[Tammy Blanchard]] as Louise and [[John Dossett]] as Herbie. Mendes also directed the 2014 Olivier Award-nominated [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the Musical|stage adaptation]] of [[Roald Dahl]]'s ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'',.<ref name="musical">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18493739 "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to open in West End"].

=== Film ===
In 1999, Mendes made his film directorial debut with ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', starring [[Kevin Spacey]]. The film grossed [[United States dollar|$]]356.3&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=americanbeauty.htm | title=American Beauty (1999) | publisher=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=2009-11-22}}</ref> The film won the Golden Globe Award, the BAFTA Award and the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Mendes's second film, in 2002, was ''[[Road to Perdition]]'', which grossed US$181&nbsp;million. The aggregate review score on Rotten Tomatoes was 82%; critics praised [[Paul Newman]] for his performance. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actor, and won one for Best Cinematography.

In 2003, Mendes established [[Neal Street Productions]], a film, television and theatre production company he would use to finance much of his later work.

In 2005, Mendes directed the war film ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'', in association with his production company [[Neal Street Productions]]. The film received mixed reviews, with a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 61%, and a gross revenue of US$96.9&nbsp;million worldwide. The film focused on the boredom and other psychological challenges of wartime.

In 2008, Mendes directed ''[[Revolutionary Road (film)|Revolutionary Road]]'', starring his then-wife, [[Kate Winslet]], along with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Kathy Bates]]. In a January 2009 interview, Mendes commented, about directing his wife for the first time, "I would open my eyes in the morning and there Kate would be, going, 'Great! You're awake! Now let's talk about the second scene.'"<ref name="Diane Solway 2009">{{Cite journal | title= Scenes from a Marriage | author= Diane Solway | work=[[W (magazine)|W]]  | date= January 2009| url= http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2009/01/sam_mendes| accessdate=19 February 2009| postscript= <!--None--> }}</ref> Mendes' comedy-drama ''[[Away We Go]]'' opened the 2009 [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]]. The film follows a couple ([[John Krasinski]], [[Maya Rudolph]]) searching North America for the perfect community in which to settle down and start a family. The film was well received by critics but performed poorly at the box office.

In 2010, he co-produced a critically acclaimed documentary film ''[[Out of the Ashes (2010 film)|Out of the Ashes]]'' that deals with cricket in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricket.yahoo.com/photos/they-also-played-cricket-1368451286-slideshow/away-we-go-special-new-york-screening-photo--1644522943.html|title=They Also Played Cricket|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|date=14 May 2013|accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/blog/2010/jul/20/the-spin-afghanistan-film-cricket|title=Out of the Ashes reveals the amazing story of Afghanistan cricket|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref>

====James Bond====
[[File:JavierBardemSamMendesHWOFNov2012.jpg|thumb|right|Mendes (right) collaborated with [[Javier Bardem]] for ''Skyfall'', November 2012]]
On 5 January 2010, news broke that Mendes was employed to direct the 23rd [[Eon Productions]] installment of the ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/6939216/British-director-Sam-Mendes-in-talks-over-next-James-Bond-film.html|title=British director Sam Mendes in talks over next James Bond film |date=6 January 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=10 January 2010 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Allen}}</ref> The film, ''[[Skyfall]]'', was subsequently released on 26 October 2012, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Bond films. Mendes had been employed as a consultant on the film when it was in pre-production, and had remained attached to the project during the financial troubles of MGM.

The film was a major critical and commercial success, becoming the 14th film to gross over $1 billion worldwide.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/9771918/Skyfall-most-successful-James-Bond-film-tops-1bn-at-global-box-office.html "Skyfall: 'most successful' James Bond film tops $1bn at global box office"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', Retrieved 24 January 2013</ref><ref name="Milestone">[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/james-bonds-skyfall-1-billion-407126 "Box Office Milestone: Daniel Craig's 'Skyfall' Crosses $1 Billion Worldwide"]. The Hollywood Reporter. Retrieved 24 January 2013</ref>

Following the success of ''Skyfall'', Mendes was asked if he was returning to direct the next Bond film. He responded, "I felt I put everything I possibly could into this film and it was the Bond film I wanted to make. And if I felt I could do the same again, then absolutely I would consider doing another one. But it is a big task and I wouldn't do it unless I knew I could."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hewitt|first=Chris|title=Sam Mendes Talks Gun Barrel Sequence|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=35699|accessdate=15 June 2013|newspaper=Empire|date=6 November 2012}}</ref>

It was reported that one reason Mendes was reluctant to commit was that one proposal involved making two films back-to-back, based on an idea by ''Skyfall'' writer [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], which would have resulted in Mendes and other creative personnel being tied up with filming for around four years. It was reported in February 2013 that this idea had since been shelved<ref name=DailyMail>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2278914/Sam-Mendes-James-Bond-sights-Skyfalls-phenomenal-box-office-success.html|work=Daily Mail|title=BAZ BAMIGBOYE: Director Sam Mendes has James Bond back in his sights after Skyfall's phenomenal box office success|date=14 February 2013|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> and that the next two films would be stand-alone. The same report claimed that Mendes was "75% on board, but was waiting to see the finished script before committing."<ref name=DailyMail />

However, Mendes said in an interview with Empire Magazine in March 2013 that "It has been a very difficult decision not to accept Michael and Barbara's very generous offer to direct the next Bond movie." He cited, amongst other reasons, his commitments to the stage version of ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory the Musical|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Phil de Semlyen|title=Sam Mendes Won't Direct Bond 24|url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=36712|accessdate=15 June 2013|newspaper=empire|date=6 March 2013}}</ref>

However, on 29 May 2013, it was reported that Mendes was back in negotiations with producers Wilson and Broccoli to direct the next Bond film,<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC News - Sam Mendes back in talks with Bond producers|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22700298|accessdate=29 May 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=29 May 2013}}</ref> going back on comments that he had previously made on 5 March 2013 announcing that he would not be directing the 24th Bond film in order to focus efforts on his career in theatre.<ref name="thetimesburgess"/><ref>{{cite news|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|title=Sam Mendes turns down the next James Bond film for a life in the theater|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/sam-mendes-turns-down-the-next-bond-film-for-a-lif,93334/|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=Newswire|date=6 March 2013}}</ref> Wilson and Broccoli were willing to postpone production of the film to ensure Mendes' participation.

On 11 July 2013 it was announced that Mendes would direct the 24th James Bond film, subsequently named ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', due for release in 2015.<ref name="MendesLogan to return">{{cite web|title=Sam Mendes Returns to Direct|url=http://www.007.com/bond-24-news-2/|publisher=[[Eon Productions]]|accessdate=11 July 2013|date=11 July 2013}}</ref> This makes him the first filmmaker since [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]] to direct two Bond films in a row.
