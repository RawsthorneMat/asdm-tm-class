'''Quentin Jerome Tarantino'''<ref>{{cite book|title=Quentin Tarantino Biography (1963-|publisher=Advameg, Inc|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/96/Quentin-Tarantino.html|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}</ref> ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|ɛ|ɹ|ə|n|ˈ|t|iː|n|oʊ|}}; born March 27, 1963) is an American film director, screenwriter, cinematographer, producer, and actor. His films are characterized by [[nonlinear (arts)|non-linear storylines]], satirical subject matter, and an [[aestheticization of violence]], as well as features of [[neo-noir]] film<ref name="Literary Studies 1999 pg. 8-32">{{cite doi|10.1080/02564719908530214}}</ref> and [[spaghetti Western]]s.

Tarantino grew up an obsessed film fan and worked at [[Video Archives]], a video rental store while training to act. His career began in the late 1980s, when he wrote and directed ''[[My Best Friend's Birthday]]'', the screenplay of which formed the basis for ''[[True Romance]]''. In the early 1990s, he began his career as an [[Independent film|independent]] filmmaker with the release of ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' in 1992; regarded as a classic and cult hit, it was called the "Greatest Independent Film of All Time" by ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''. Its popularity was boosted by the release in 1994 of his second film, ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', a neo-noir crime film that became a major critical and commercial success and judged the greatest film of the past 25 years (1983-2008) by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207063,00.html |title=The New Classics: Movies |work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 8, 2007|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>  Paying homage to the [[blaxploitation]] films of the 1970s, Tarantino released ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'' in 1997, an adaptation of the novel ''[[Rum Punch]]''.

''[[Kill Bill]]'', a highly stylized "revenge flick" in the cinematic traditions of [[Kendo|Japanese martial arts]], [[spaghetti western]]s and [[poliziotteschi|Italian horror]], followed six years later, and was released as two films: ''[[Kill Bill Volume 1|Vol. 1]]'' in 2003, and ''[[Kill Bill Volume 2|Vol. 2]]'' in 2004. Tarantino directed ''[[Death Proof]]'' (2007) as part of a [[double feature]] with friend [[Robert Rodriguez]], under the collective title ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''. His long-postponed ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', which tells the fictional alternate history story of two plots to assassinate Nazi Germany's political leadership, was released in 2009 to positive reviews. His most recent work is 2012's critically acclaimed ''[[Django Unchained]]'', a western film set in the [[antebellum era]] of the [[Deep South]]. It became the highest-grossing film of his career so far, making over $425 million at the box office.

Tarantino's films have garnered both critical and commercial success. He has received many industry awards, including two [[Academy Award]]s, two [[Golden Globe Awards]], two [[BAFTA Awards]] and the [[Palme d'Or]], and has been nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy]] and a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]. He was named one of the ''100 Most Influential People in the World'' by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 2005,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20131020153940/http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1972656_1972696_1973085,00.html | work=TIME | title=Quentin Tarantino{{snd}}The 2005 Time 100 | date=April 18, 2005 |first=Richard |last=Corliss}}</ref> and filmmaker and historian [[Peter Bogdanovich]] has called him "the single most influential director of his generation".<ref>{{cite news |last=Ryzik |first=Melena |url=http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/04/tarantino-unveils-django-the-shortest-long-western/ |title=Tarantino Unveils 'Django,' the Shortest Long Western |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 4, 2012 |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>

Tarantino grew bored with the James Best Acting School and left after two years, although he kept in touch with all of his acting friends.

==Film career==

===1980s===
After Tarantino met [[Lawrence Bender]] at a Hollywood party, Bender encouraged him to write a screenplay.  Tarantino co-wrote and directed a movie called ''[[My Best Friend's Birthday]]'' in 1987.  The final reel of the film was almost completely destroyed in a lab fire that occurred during editing,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} but its screenplay later formed the basis for ''[[True Romance]]''.

===1990s===
In January 1992, Tarantino's ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' was screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].  It was an immediate hit, with the film receiving a positive response from critics. The dialogue-driven [[heist movie]] set the tone for Tarantino's later films. Tarantino wrote the script for the film in three-and-a-half weeks and Bender forwarded it to director [[Monte Hellman]].  Hellman helped Tarantino to secure funding from [[Richard Gladstein]] at Live Entertainment (which later became Artisan, now known as [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]). [[Harvey Keitel]] read the script and also contributed to the funding, taking a role as co-producer and also playing a part in the movie.<ref>Keitel heard of the script through his wife, who had attended a class with Lawrence Bender (see ''Reservoir Dogs'' special edition DVD commentary).</ref>

[[File:Rodriguez and Tarantino, 2007.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Tarantino has had a number of collaborations with director [[Robert Rodriguez]].]]

Tarantino's screenplay ''[[True Romance]]'' was [[option (filmmaking)|optioned]] and the film was eventually released in 1993. The second script that Tarantino sold was for the film ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'', which was revised by Dave Veloz, Richard Rutowski and director [[Oliver Stone]]. Tarantino was given story credit and in an interview stated that he wished the film well.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=Graham |editor=Peary, Gerald |title=Quentin Tarantino: Interviews |year=1998 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=1-57806-051-6 |pages=57–59 |chapter=Graham Fuller/1993 }}</ref><ref name="usc">{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090328131654/http://cinema.usc.edu/about/events/event_20090319.htm?| title=Outside the Box <nowiki>[Office]</nowiki> presents: While She Was Out |date=April 17, 2009 |publisher=[['USC School of Cinematic Arts]]| accessdate=August 29, 2014}}</ref> The film engendered enmity, and the publication of a 'tell all' book titled ''Killer Instinct'' by [[Jane Hamsher]]—who with [[Don Murphy]] had an original option on the screenplay and produced the film—led to Tarantino physically assaulting Murphy in the AGO restaurant in West Hollywood, CA in October 1997. Murphy subsequently filed a $5m lawsuit against Tarantino, which was eventually settled out of court.<ref>{{cite news |last=McCann |first=Paul |title=Quentin Tarantino in $5M Assault Claim |newspaper=The Independent |date=November 18, 1997 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/quentin-tarantino-in-5m-assault-claim-1294720.html |accessdate=October 5, 1997}}</ref> Following the success of ''Reservoir Dogs'', Tarantino was approached by Hollywood and offered numerous projects, including ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' and ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]'', but he instead retreated to [[Amsterdam]] to work on his script for ''Pulp Fiction''.

In ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), Tarantino maintained the ''[[aestheticization of violence]]'', for which he is known, as well as his non-linear storylines. Tarantino received an Academy Award in the Best Writing (Original Screenplay) category, which he shared with [[Roger Avary]]. He also received a nomination in the Best Director category.  The film received another five nominations, including for Best Picture.  Tarantino also won the [[Palme d'Or]] for the film at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].  The film has grossed over $200 million and was met with outstanding reviews.

After ''Pulp Fiction'' was completed, Tarantino directed episode four of ''[[Four Rooms]]'', "The Man from Hollywood", a tribute to the episode "[[Man from the South]]" from the television show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', which starred [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] in an adaptation of a [[Roald Dahl]] story. ''Four Rooms'' was a collaborative effort with filmmakers [[Allison Anders]], [[Alexandre Rockwell]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]]. The film was very poorly received by critics.

Tarantino appeared in and wrote the script for Robert Rodriguez's ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996), which saw mixed reviews from the critics. It nevertheless quickly reached [[From Dusk till Dawn (film series)|cult status]], spawning a continuing saga of two sequels, for which Tarantino and Rodriguez only served as executive producers, and a 2014 TV series, [[From Dusk till Dawn: The Series]].

Tarantino's third feature film was ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'' (1997), an adaptation of ''[[Rum Punch]]'', a novel by [[Elmore Leonard]]. An homage to [[blaxploitation]] films, it starred [[Pam Grier]], who starred in many of the films of that genre in the 1970s.  Leonard considered ''Jackie Brown'' to be the favourite of the 26 different screen adaptations of his novels and short stories.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/31/booksforchildrenandteenagers.elmoreleonard | title=Detroit spinner | work=[[The Guardian]] |last1=Hudson|first1=Jeff| date= July 30, 2004|accessdate=July 17, 2014 }}</ref>

===2000s===
Tarantino had next planned to make ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', as it was provisionally titled, but postponed this to write and direct ''[[Kill Bill]]'', a highly stylized "revenge flick" in the cinematic traditions of ''[[Wuxia film|Wuxia]]'' (Chinese martial arts), ''[[Jidaigeki]]'' (Japanese period cinema), [[spaghetti western]]s and [[poliziotteschi|Italian horror]]. It was originally set for a single theatrical release, but its 4-hour plus running time prompted Tarantino to divide it into two movies. ''[[Kill Bill Volume 1|Vol. 1]]'' was released in late 2003 and ''[[Kill Bill Volume 2|Vol. 2]]'' was released in 2004. It was based on a character called [[Beatrix Kiddo|The Bride]] and a plot that he and ''Kill Bill''{{'}}s lead actress [[Uma Thurman]] had developed during the making of ''Pulp Fiction''.

In 2004, Tarantino attended the [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes film festival]], where he served as President of the Jury. Although ''Kill Bill'' was not in competition, ''Vol. 2'' had an evening screening, and was also shown on the morning of the final day in its original 3-hour plus version, with Tarantino himself attending the full screening. Tarantino went on to be credited as "Special Guest Director" in Robert Rodriguez's 2005 [[neo-noir]] film ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', for his work directing the car sequence featuring [[Clive Owen]] and [[Benicio del Toro]].

In May 2005, Tarantino co-wrote and directed ''[[Grave Danger]]'', the [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (season 5)|5th season]] finale of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]''. For this episode, Tarantino was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series]] on the [[57th Primetime Emmy Awards]].<ref>[http://m.emmys.com/news/mischa-barton-matthew-fox-debra-messing-william-petersen-and-quentin-tarantino-confirmed 57TH ANNUAL PRIMETIME EMMY AWARDS Awards Broadcast Live From Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium on September 18 on the CBS Television Network]</ref>

Tarantino's next film project was ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', which he co-directed with Rodriguez. Released in theaters on April 6, 2007, Tarantino's contribution to the ''Grindhouse'' project was titled ''[[Death Proof]]''. It began as a take on 1970s [[slasher films]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Grant |last=Lauchlan |title=Quentin Tarantino: defending Death Proof |date=September 3, 2007 |publisher=stv.tv |work=Grant's Film Club |url=http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/displayHotnow.html?id=opencms:/out/hotnow/films/Quentin_Tarantinox_defending_Deat_200709 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080618080849/http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/displayHotnow.html?id=opencms:/out/hotnow/films/Quentin_Tarantinox_defending_Deat_200709 |archivedate=June 18, 2008 |accessdate=October 23, 2008}}</ref> but evolved dramatically as the project unfolded. Ticket sales were low despite mostly positive reviews.

Among Tarantino's producing credits are the horror film ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'', which included numerous references to his own ''Pulp Fiction''; the adaptation of [[Elmore Leonard]]'s ''[[Killshot]]'', for which Tarantino was credited as an executive producer, although he was no longer associated with the film after its 2009 release;<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tarantino.info/2008/11/17/killshot-riding-back-on-rourkes-oscar-vehicle/ |title=Killshot riding back on Rourke's Oscar vehicle? |date=November 17, 2008 |publisher=The Quentin Tarantino Archives}}</ref> and ''[[Hell Ride]]'', written and directed by [[Larry Bishop]] and Jonny Lane who both appeared in ''Kill Bill Vol. 2''.

Tarantino's film ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', released in 2009, is the story of a group of Jewish-American [[guerilla]] soldiers in [[Nazi]]-occupied France during [[World War II]]. Filming began in October 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/07/09/script-reviews-for-quentin-tarantinos-inglorious-bastards-hit-web/ |title=Script Reviews for Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards Hit Web!

===2010s===
[[File:Quentin Tarantino Django 2.jpg|thumb|Tarantino in Paris in January 2013, at the French premiere of ''[[Django Unchained]]''.]]
In 2011, production began on ''[[Django Unchained]]'', a film about the revenge of a slave in the U.S. South in 1858. The film stemmed from Tarantino's desire to produce a [[spaghetti western]] set in America's [[Deep South]].  Tarantino called the proposed style "a southern",<ref name="flop"/> stating that he wanted "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with [[slavery]] and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to".<ref name="flop">{{cite news |title=Quentin Tarantino: I'm proud of my flop|work=The Daily Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/04/27/bfquentin27.xml&page=1 |date= April 27, 2007|first=John |last=Hiscock}}</ref> The film was released on December 25, 2012.

===As producer===
In recent years, Tarantino has used his Hollywood power to give smaller and foreign films more attention than they might have received otherwise. These films are usually labeled "Presented by Quentin Tarantino" or "Quentin Tarantino Presents". The first of these productions was in 2001 with the Hong Kong martial arts film ''[[Iron Monkey (1993 film)|Iron Monkey]]'', which made over $14 million in the United States, seven times its budget. In 2004 he brought the Chinese martial arts film ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' to U.S. shores. It ended up having a No. 1 opening at the box office and making $53.5 million. In 2006, the latest "Quentin Tarantino presents" production, ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'', opened at No. 1 at the box office with a $20.1 million opening weekend, good for 8th all time in January. He presented 2006's ''[[Tom-Yum-Goong|The Protector]]'', and is a producer of the 2007 film ''[[Hostel: Part II]]''.  In 2008 he produced the [[Larry Bishop]]-helmed ''[[Hell Ride]]'', a revenge biker film.

In addition, in 1995 Tarantino formed [[Rolling Thunder Pictures]] with Miramax to release or re-release several independent and foreign features. By 1997, Miramax had shut down the company due to "lack of interest" in the pictures released. The following films were released by Rolling Thunder Pictures: ''[[Chungking Express]]'' (1994, dir.

===Other potential films===
Before ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', Quentin Tarantino had considered making ''The Vega Brothers''.{{anchor|The Vega Brothers}} The film would have starred [[Michael Madsen]] and [[John Travolta]] reprising their roles of Vic (Mr. Blonde) from ''Reservoir Dogs'' and Vincent from ''Pulp Fiction''. In 2007, because of the age of the actors and the onscreen deaths of both characters, he claimed that the film—which he intended to call ''Double V Vega''—is "kind of unlikely now".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/04/07/quentin-tarantino-talks-vega-brothers-the-pulp-fiction-reservoir-dogs-sequelprequel/ |title=Quentin Tarantino talks Vega Brothers, the Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs sequel/prequel |publisher=SlashFilm |first=Peter |last=Sciretta |date=April 7, 2007}}</ref>

In 2009, in an interview for Italian TV, after being asked about the success of the two ''Kill Bill'' films, Tarantino said, "You haven't asked me about the third one", and implied that he would be making a third ''Kill Bill'' film with the words, "The Bride will fight again!"<ref>[http://www.badtaste.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=9753&Itemid=29 Quentin Tarantino Talks Kill Bill 3: The Bride Will Fight Again!], BadTaste.it, October 1, 2009.

In a 2012 interview for the website ''We Got This Covered'', Tarantino said that a third ''Kill Bill'' film would "probably not" happen. He also said that he would not be directing a new James Bond film, saying that he was only interested in directing ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' at one point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-vol-3-james-bond/|title=Quentin Tarantino Says No To Kill Bill Vol. 3 And James Bond |publisher=''wegotthiscovered.com'' |date= December 11, 2012|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref> In a late 2012 interview with the online magazine ''[[The Root (magazine)|The Root]]'', Tarantino clarified his remarks and described his next film as being the final entry in a "''Django-Inglourious Basterds''" trilogy called ''Killer Crow''. The film will depict a group of [[World War II]]-era black troops who have "been fucked over by the American military and kind of go apeshit. They basically – the way Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) and the Basterds are having an 'Apache resistance' – [the] black troops go on an Apache warpath and kill a bunch of white soldiers and white officers on a military base and are just making a warpath to Switzerland."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theroot.com/views/tarantino-unchained-part-1-django-trilogy|title=Django Unchained Trilogy and More: Tarantino Talks to Gates|publisher=''theroot.com'' |date= December 23, 2012|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref>

A long-running rumor in the industry is that Tarantino is interested in filming a new version of [[Bret Easton Ellis]]′ 1985 novel, ''[[Less Than Zero (novel)|Less Than Zero]]''. His friend [[Roger Avary]] adapted ''[[Rules of Attraction]]'', another novel by Ellis, to film in 2002, and since both he and Tarantino like the works by Ellis, Tarantino has been eyeing the possibility of adapting ''Less Than Zero''. Ellis recently confirmed, in an interview for [[Vice Magazine|''Vice'' magazine]], that Tarantino had been "trying to get Fox to let him remake it".<ref>{{cite web|last=Pearson |first=Jesse |url=http://www.vice.com/read/bret-easton-ellis-426-v17n5 |title=Bret Easton Ellis|work=Vice|date=May 2, 2010 |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> At a Q&A session at [[Harvard Book Store]] in 2012, in reply to a question asking whether ''Less Than Zero'' would be remade, Ellis once again confirmed that Tarantino "has shown interest" in adapting the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WydKXLyHynA |title=Bret Easton Ellis&nbsp;– Imperial Bedrooms |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=September 10, 2012 |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> At the 2014 Comic-Con, Tarantino revealed he is contemplating a possible science-fiction film.

Tarantino has described himself as non-religious yet has often stated a belief in [[divine inspiration]], which he has admitted confuses him. He believes in [[reincarnation]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpOyEnMNOtI</ref>

Tarantino has also said, "I'm not saying that I'll never get married or have a kid before I'm 60. But I've made a choice, so far, to go on this road alone. Because this is my time to make movies."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/tarantino-sacrificed-love-for-his-career_1111124 |title=Tarantino Sacrificed Love For His Career |publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]] |date=July 28, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}</ref>

Tarantino has said that he plans to retire from filmmaking when he is 60, in order to focus on writing novels and film literature. He is skeptical of the film industry going digital, saying, "If it actually gets to the place where you can't show 35&nbsp;mm film in theatres anymore and everything is digital projection, I won't even make it to 60."<ref>{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first =Simon|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a191697/tarantino-im-going-to-become-a-novelist.html |title=Tarantino: 'I'm going to become a novelist' |publisher=Digital Spy |date=December 16, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}</ref> He has then stated that he has a plan, although "not etched in stone", to retire after making his tenth movie: "If I get to the 10th, do a good job and don’t screw it up, well that sounds like a good way to end the old career.”<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.wow-dude.net/article/235/Quentin-Tarantino-Still-Wants-To-Retire-After-His-Tenth-Film.html|title = Quentin Tarantino still wants to retire after his tenth film|date = 2014-11-11|accessdate = 2014-11-11|website = Wow Dude|publisher = Wow Dude|last = |first = }}</ref>

==Influences and style of filmmaking==
An awards ceremony in the [[Critics Choice Awards]] celebrated Tarantino, citing his start in filmmaking when he was in his twenties.  Music is an important part of Tarantino's filmmaking style, and he said that he would listen to music in his bedroom and create scenes which correlated to the music that was being played.<ref>[[Critics Choice Award]] award ceremony about Quentin Tarantino.

In the 2012 ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' directors' poll, Tarantino listed his top 12 films:  ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', ''[[The Bad News Bears]]'', ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', ''[[His Girl Friday]]'', ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[Pretty Maids All in a Row]]'', ''[[Rolling Thunder (film)|Rolling Thunder]]'', ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'', ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', with the last being his favorite.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Greatest Films Poll - 2012 - Quentin Tarantino|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/1134|accessdate=September 10, 2014|publisher=British Film Institute}}</ref> In 2009, he named [[Kinji Fukasaku]]'s violent action film ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' as his favorite film released since he became a director in 1992.<ref>[http://www.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-tarantinotop20/2/ Quentin Tarantino's Top 20 Favorite Films]. comcast.net</ref> He is also a fan of the 1981 film ''[[Blow Out]]'' directed by [[Brian De Palma]], so much so that he used the main star of the film, [[John Travolta]], in ''Pulp Fiction''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9wKVjWKHdo&t=12m6s |title=BAFTA&nbsp;– Quentin Tarantino: A Life in Pictures |publisher=Youtube.com |date=January 27, 2010 |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> Tarantino praised [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2006 film ''[[Apocalypto]]'', saying, "I think it's a masterpiece.

Tarantino often uses graphic violence that has proven seductive to audiences, and he has been harshly criticized for his use of gore and blood in an entrancing yet simultaneously repulsive way.  His films have been staunchly criticized and scorned for their use of violence, blood and action as a "color" within cinema, and rebuked for allegedly using human suffering as a punchline.<ref>Childhood Living

Actor [[Steve Buscemi]] has described Tarantino's novel style of filmmaking as "bursting with energy" and "focused",<ref name=mares>{{cite journal|last=Tarantino|first=Quentin|title=Steve Buscemi by Quentin Tarantino|journal=BOMB|year=1993|volume=42|issue=Winter|url=http://bombsite.com/issues/42/articles/1614|accessdate=September 20, 2011}}</ref> a style that has earned him many accolades worldwide. According to Tarantino, a hallmark of all his movies is that there is a different sense of humor in each one, which gets the audience to laugh at things that are not funny.<ref>[http://www.gomolo.in/features/article.aspx?ArticleID=202 There is a sense of humor in all of my movies]. gomolo.in (October 1, 2009)</ref> However, he insists that his films are dramas, not comedies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukscreen.com/articles/interviews/quentin-tarantino-my-films-are-spaghetti-westerns/#.UQxI3I5wY20 |title=Quentin Tarantino: My Films are Spaghetti Westerns |publisher=UKScreen |date=January 3, 2013 |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> [[Michael Winner]], while appearing on an episode of ''[[Piers Morgan's Life Stories]]'', a British [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] production, stated that Quentin Tarantino was a "big fan" of his own film ''[[Death Wish (film)|Death Wish]]''.

Tarantino has stated that the celebrated animation-action sequence in ''Kill Bill'' (2003) was inspired by the use of 2D animated sequences in actor [[Kamal Hassan]]'s [[Tamil film]] ''[[Aalavandhan]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/kamal-haasan-inspired-director-quentin-tarantino/271787-71-180.html|title=Kamal Haasan inspired director Quentin Tarantino|accessdate=2014-11-06|publisher=ibnlive.in.com}}</ref> He often seeks to harness, manipulate and ultimately imitate the aesthetic elements and conventions typically used in the cartoon medium. More specifically, he often attempts to meld comic strip formulas and aesthetics within a live action film sequence, in some cases by the literal use of cartoon or anime images. Tarantino's cinematic ambition to marry artistic expression via live action and cartoonism is yet another example of his ability to morph genres and conventions to produce a new and authentic style of his own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://resolver.scholarsportal.info.proxy.bib.uottawa.ca/resolve/17468477/v02i0002/171_ttc |title=Réseau de bibliothèques&nbsp;– Library Network |publisher=Resolver.scholarsportal.info.proxy.bib.uottawa.ca |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>

Tarantino often manipulates the use of commodities in order to propel plot development or to present an intriguing juxtaposition that ultimately enhances his notorious combination of humor and violence, equating a branded genre with branded consumption.<ref name="Literary Studies 1999 pg. 8-32"/> He often pairs bizarre props with an equally bizarre scene, in which the prop itself develops into something of higher substance. Likewise, he often favors particular brand names of his own creation to make promotional appearances. The typical brands he uses within his films are "Acuña Boys Tex-Mex Food", "[[Big Kahuna Burger]]", "G.O. Juice", "Jack Rabbit Slim's", "K-Billy", "Red Apple cigarettes", "Tenku Brand Beer" and "Teriyaki Donut".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarantino.info/ |title=The Quentin Tarantino Archives |publisher=Tarantino.info |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>

On the biopic genre, Tarantino has said that he has "no respect" for biopics, saying that they "are just big excuses for actors to win Oscars. ... Even the most interesting person – if you are telling their life from beginning to end, it’s going to be a fucking boring movie.”<ref name=":0">[http://the-talks.com/interviews/quentin-tarantino/ Quentin Tarantino: “It's a corrupted cinema”]; [[The Talks]]</ref> However, in an interview with [[Charlie Rose]], he said:

<blockquote>There is one story that I could be interested in, but it would probably be one of the last movies I [ever make] ... My favorite hero in American history is [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]. He's my favorite American who ever lived. He basically single-handedly started the road to end [[slavery]] and ... he killed people to do it. He decided, 'If we start spilling white blood, then they're going to start getting the idea.'<ref>"[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10567 An hour with Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino about his film 'Inglourious Basterds']". August 21, 2009.</ref></blockquote>

Tarantino has stated in many interviews that his writing process is like writing a novel before formatting it into a script, saying that this creates the blueprint of the film and makes the film feel like literature. About his writing process he told website [[The Talks]]:

<blockquote>[My] head is a sponge. I listen to what everyone says, I watch little idiosyncratic behavior, people tell me a joke and I remember it. People tell me an interesting story in their life and I remember it. ... when I go and write my new characters, my pen is like an antenna, it gets that information, and all of a sudden these characters come out more or less fully formed. I don’t write their dialogue, I get them talking to each other.<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>

In 2013, a survey of 17 academics was carried out to discover which filmmakers had been referenced the most in essays and dissertations on film that had been marked in the previous five years.  It revealed that Tarantino was the most-studied director in the UK, ahead of [[Christopher Nolan]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a529084/quentin-tarantino-is-most-studied-director-in-the-uk.html|title=Quentin Tarantino is most-studied director in the UK|date=November 6, 2013|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=November 6, 2013}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Gun violence===
Tarantino does not believe that violence in movies inspires acts of violence in real life.  In an interview after the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] in 2012, he expressed "annoyance" at the suggestion that there is a link between the two, saying, "I think it's disrespectful to [the] memory of those who died to talk about movies. ...

===Racial epithets===
[[Spike Lee]] questioned Tarantino's use of racial epithets in his films, particularly the word "[[nigger]]". In a ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' interview discussing ''Jackie Brown'', Lee said, "I'm not against the word...And some people speak that way.  But Quentin is infatuated with that word.

Tarantino has defended his use of the word, arguing that black audiences have an appreciation of his [[blaxploitation]]-influenced films that eludes some of his critics, and indeed, that ''Jackie Brown'' was primarily made for "black audiences".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/1998/jan/05/quentintarantino.guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank|title=Quentin Tarantino interview (III) with Pam Grier, Robert Forster and Lawrence Bender|work=The Guardian|date=5 January 1998}}</ref>

===Gawker lawsuit over ''The Hateful Eight''===

In January 2014, Gawker leaked a copy of the script for Tarantino's upcoming film titled ''The Hateful Eight''. After the script was released online, Tarantino decided to scrap the project altogether and chose to use the story for a novel instead.

The controversy did not stop there; Tarantino filed a copyright lawsuit against Gawker, and stated in the lawsuit that "Gawker Media has made a business of predatory journalism, violating people's rights to make a buck" (quote from ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''). The lawsuit also demanded compensation in the amount of $1,000,000. Tarantino later dropped the lawsuit but his statements have led many{{Who|date=May 2015}} to believe that he will be refiling the lawsuit at a later date. Tarantino stated in his motion: "This dismissal is made without prejudice, whereby plaintiff may later advance an action and refile a complaint after further investigations to ascertain and plead the identities of additional infringers" (''The Hollywood Reporter''). Tarantino has yet to refile a claim but retains the legal right to do so in the future.<ref>Eriq Gardner. "Quentin Tarantino Suing Gawker Over Leaked 'Hateful Eight' Script (Exclusive)." ''The Hollywood Reporter''. N.p., 27 January 2014. Web. 08 February 2015.</ref>

At the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], Tarantino confirmed the film, and stated that he was working on a third draft of the film, set for a potential release in 2015. This contradicted his earlier statements which suggested that the film was not going to be made.
