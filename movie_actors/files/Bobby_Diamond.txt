==Attempted entry into films==
In an attempt to graduate to more mature and serious roles, as well as break onto the silver screen, Diamond starred in the film ''[[Airborne (1962 film)|Airborne]]'' as Eddie Slocom a naive,country boy who wants to join the US [[82nd Airborne Division]]. Possessing a likeable cast of characters played fairly well by predominantly non-professional actors and Diamond's own creditable and believable performance as Eddie, the film which follows the course of his training to become a paratrooper was moderately well received by the public. However critics panned it due to the contrived and highly predictable story line and it remains today almost unknown.

''[[Airborne (1962 film)|Airborne]]'' was his only lead role in a film, his only other film appearances were in supporting roles in the [[Patty Duke]] vehicle ''[[Billie (film)|Billie]]'' and the 1981 slasher film ''[[Scream (1981 film)|Scream]]''.

He also appeared in episodes of NBC's ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (TV western series) starring [[Ward Bond]] and CBS's ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' (television [[science fiction]] series), ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', and ''[[Mister Ed]]''. He was cast as Gus in the 1964 episode, "Visions of Sugar Plums", of the NBC education drama series, ''[[Mr. Novak]]'', starring [[James Franciscus]] as an idealistic high school teacher in Los Angeles.
 
Between 1965 and 1967, Diamond guest starred with [[Robert Bray]], in the lead role of Forest Ranger Corey Stuart, in three episodes of CBS's ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]''.
