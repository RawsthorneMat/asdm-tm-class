==Biography==

===Childhood and early years===
Fisher was born in [[Grady County, Oklahoma]] in [[Tabler, Oklahoma|Tabler]] (near [[Chickasha, Oklahoma|Chickasha]]) into a farming family, the son of a [[Scotland|Scots]]-[[Ireland|Irish]] father and part-[[Choctaw]] mother<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0279786 | title =Biography for Shug Fisher | publisher = IMDb Mini Biography | author = Brumburgh, Gary | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref> and the youngest of four children.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cowboydirectory.com/F/f--ea.html | title =Shug Fisher | publisher =Cowboy Directory.com| author = Paregien, Stan (editor) | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-19}}</ref> He gained the nickname "Shug" (short for sugar) at a young age, which he explained as, "My mama gave it to me 'cause I was such a sweet baby."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0279786 | title =Biography for Shug Fisher | publisher = IMDb Mini Biography | author = Brumburgh, Gary | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref> In 1917, the family moved by [[covered wagon]] to [[Pittsburg County, Oklahoma]], near [[Indianola, Oklahoma|Indianola]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sonsofthepioneers.org/view.php?id=30 | title =Shug Fisher | publisher = Sons of the Pioneers | author = | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Soon thereafter, Fisher was drawn to the [[mandolin]] and the [[fiddle]]. His father refreshed his own fiddling ability and Fisher learned [[guitar]] to back him, and at age 16, he was playing with his father at local square dances.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bobnolan-sop.net/Biographies/The%20Story%20of%20SOP/Shug%20Fisher/Shug%20Fisher.htm | title = George "Shug" Fisher | publisher = bobnolan.com | author = Griffis, Ken ''Hear My Song'' | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-22}}</ref> He could not afford a fiddle case and instead protected his instrument with a [[pillow|pillow case]] tied to the [[Western saddle|saddle horn]].

After watching a comedian with a traveling [[medicine show]] in 1924,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cowboydirectory.com/F/f--ea.html | title =Shug Fisher | publisher =Cowboy Directory.com| author = Paregien, Stan (editor) | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-19}}</ref> he decided to pursue a career in entertainment. The following year, Fisher, his father, and a friend drove a [[Ford Model T]] to California's [[San Joaquin Valley]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sonsofthepioneers.org/view.php?id=30 | title =Shug Fisher | publisher = Sons of the Pioneers | author = | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> where he worked as a fruit-picker<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0279786 | title =Biography for Shug Fisher | publisher = IMDb Mini Biography | author = Brumburgh, Gary | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref> and a cable and tool dresser in oil fields. He continued to perform, playing fiddle at social events and square dances. In 1927, he was asked to appear on ''[[The Fresno Bee|The Fresno Bee's]]'' radio station, [[KMJ|KMJ-AM]], but only for the publicity. He later said "publicity was fine, but you can’t eat it...My motto was, pay me something, or I don’t play."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sonsofthepioneers.org/view.php?id=30| title =Shug Fisher | publisher = Sons of the Pioneers | author = | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Los Angeles calls===
In 1931, Tom Murray, who had recently left the Beverly Hill<!-- EDITORS: Hill Billies is two words in this usage --> Billies, offered Fisher a spot with his new group, the Hollywood Hillbillies, based in [[Los Angeles]]. Fisher learned to play the [[double bass|bass fiddle]] with the group and claimed he was one of the first to play the instrument in a country band. The Hillbillies appeared on the ''Hollywood Breakfast Club'' radio show and were fairly popular around Los Angeles but had little income to show for it.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sonsofthepioneers.org/view.php?id=30 | title =Shug Fisher | publisher = Sons of the Pioneers | author = | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In late 1933, Fisher and Ken Carson left the group to join several members of the Beverly Hill Billies who had moved to [[San Francisco]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sonsofthepioneers.org/view.php?id=30|title =Shug Fisher | publisher = Sons of the Pioneers | author = | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The original group was the brainchild of the general manager of [[KSPN (AM)|KPMC-AM]], who promoted the members as authentic "hillbilly" musicians who he'd "discovered."<ref>Harkins, Anthony ''Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon'' Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> As part of the ruse, the members always adopted hillbilly names, so Fisher became Aaron Judd and Carson was Kaleb Winbush.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bobnolan-sop.net/Biographies/The%20Story%20of%20SOP/Shug%20Fisher/Shug%20Fisher.htm | title = George "Shug" Fisher | publisher = bobnolan.com |author = Griffis, Ken ''Hear My Song''| date = | accessdate = 2009-08-22}}</ref> After a short time, Fisher returned to Los Angeles, appearing on [[Stuart Hamblen]]'s ''Covered Wagon Jubilee'' program.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cowboydirectory.com/F/f--ea.html | title =Shug Fisher | publisher =Cowboy Directory.com| author = Paregien, Stan (editor) | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-19}}</ref>

===Ohio Valley radio career===
In 1935, Fisher took an extended road tour with Roy Faulkner, The Lonesome Cowboy, from [[XERA-AM]] in [[Del Rio, Texas]]. During an appearance in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]], Fisher was approached by Hugh Cross to join him, under [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] of the Georgie Porgie Breakfast Food Company, as an act for ''[[WWVA Jamboree]]''. Fisher agreed and the two went to [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. Under the moniker of Hugh and Shug’s Radio Pals, a reflection of their frequent radio appearances, they performed with Mary Ann Vestes and recorded for [[Decca Records|Decca]] for four years, enjoying a faithful radio audience.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sonsofthepioneers.org/view.php?id=30| title =Shug Fisher| publisher = Sons of the Pioneers | author = | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sonsofthepioneers.org/view.php?id=30 | title =Shug Fisher |publisher= Sons of the Pioneers | author = | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 1939, the two moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where they appeared on [[WLW (AM)|WLW-AM]]'s ''[[Midwestern Hayride|Boone County Jamboree]]'' and where Fisher met and married Peggy Summers of [[Bolivar, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sonsofthepioneers.org/view.php?id=30|title =Shug Fisher | publisher = Sons of the Pioneers | author= | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> At the station, he also became friends with a young [[Merle Travis]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cowboydirectory.com/F/f--ea.html | title =Shug Fisher | publisher =Cowboy Directory.com| author = Paregien, Stan (editor)|date= | accessdate = 2009-08-19}}</ref>

===Sons of the Pioneers===

When the U.S. entered [[World War II]] in 1941, Fisher returned to Los Angeles to work in [[Defense (military)|defense]] jobs, primarily at [[Lockheed Aircraft Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft]] in Burbank. Art Rush, head of the [[Hollywood Victory Committee]], requested his help arranging entertainment for defense workers during the war.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sonsofthepioneers.org/view.php?id=30 | title =Shug Fisher |publisher = Sons of the Pioneers|author= |date = | accessdate = 2009-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 1943, Fisher and Ken Carson were invited to join the [[Sons of the Pioneers]] after the group’s [[Pat Brady]] and Lloyd Perryman were [[Conscription in the United States#World War II|drafted into the service]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cowboydirectory.com/F/f--ea.html | title =Shug Fisher | publisher =Cowboy Directory.com| author = Paregien, Stan (editor) | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-19}}</ref> Replacing Brady as bassist and comedian, Fisher eagerly joined Carson, [[Tim Spencer (singer)|Tim Spencer]], [[Bob Nolan]], and [[Hugh Farr|Hugh]] and [[Karl Farr]] late that year, having appreciated the band's music and personally known its members prior to the group's inception. During this tenure, the group appeared in a string of [[Roy Rogers]] movies, recorded songs for the [[John Ford]] movies ''[[Wagon Master]]'' in [[1949 in film|1949]] and [[Rio Grande (film)|''Rio Grande'']] in [[1950 in film|1950]], and performed the theme song for ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' in 1956.

Fisher wrote a number of songs for the Pioneers, including "Out On The Open Range", "Ridin' Down To Santa Fe", later recorded by Merle Travis, and "Forgive And Forget".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0279786 | title =Biography for Shug Fisher | publisher = IMDb Mini Biography |author = Brumburgh, Gary | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref> In 1946, Fisher and Travis co-wrote "Cincinnati Lou". Fisher also wrote "That's My Paradise", "I'm Not Foolin' Now", "A Million Memories", "Pooey On You, Little Darlin'", a novelty song later recorded by [[Ken Curtis]]; "Lonesome Train Blues"; and recorded "Gooseberry Pie" using his fake stuttering as a comedy device.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cowboydirectory.com/F/f--ea.html | title =Shug Fisher | publisher =Cowboy Directory.com| author = Paregien, Stan (editor)| date =| accessdate = 2009-08-19}}</ref>

Fisher left the group in early 1946 when Brady returned from the war. In 1948, Capitol Transcriptions issued the album, ''Cowboy Jubilee'', by Shug Fisher & his Ranchmen Trio.  Fisher rejoined the Pioneers in 1949 when Brady left. The highlight of this era came in 1951 when they appeared at [[Carnegie Hall]], making them the first country band to perform there.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sonsofthepioneers.org/view.php?id=30 | title =Shug Fisher | publisher = Sons of the Pioneers | author = | date =| accessdate = 2009-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> They would also be the first to play at lavish [[nightclub]]s in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]<ref>Forsythe, Wayne. "The Sons of the Pioneers." ''Country Music Magazine'' (April 1975). Retrieved on 8-02-09.</ref> and starred on [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual Radio]]'s ''Lucky U Ranch'' program. In 1953, Fisher left to join friend Ken Curtis in television and motion pictures but again returned to the Pioneers in 1955, replacing Deuce Spriggens. He left the Pioneers for the last time in 1959, and welcomed the break to "kinda take it easy, and do a lot of hunting and fishing."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sonsofthepioneers.org/view.php?id=30 | title =Shug Fisher | publisher = Sons of the Pioneers | author = |date = | accessdate=2009-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Film and television career===
[[File:pecos pest.jpg|thumb|130px|right|Uncle Pecos (right) with Tom in ''Pecos Pest'']]A member of the [[John Ford Stock Company]], Fisher had an extensive career as a character actor in [[B movies (Hollywood Golden Age)#Cowboys and dogs|Western B-movies]] and feature films starting in 1943. Many of his early roles were as a performer with the Sons of the Pioneers in Roy Rogers' [[singing cowboy]] movies. He was also the voice of Uncle Pecos, an animated mouse, in the 1955 ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' short, ''[[Pecos Pest]]'', and is uncredited with the guitar improvisation on the cartoon’s version of "[[Frog Went A-Courting|Froggie Went A-Courtin]]".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0279786 | title =Biography for Shug Fisher | publisher = IMDb Mini Biography | author = Brumburgh, Gary | date = | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref>
