'''Rosemarie Bowe''' (born September 17, 1932) is a former American film and television actress.

==Early life==
Bowe's father was a building contractor and her mother was a dress designer. The family moved to [[Tacoma, Washington]] when Bowe was a child. She graduated from [[Stadium High School]] in Tacoma just before moving to [[Los Angeles, California]].

==Beauty contestant==
She was crowned Miss Tacoma and Miss Montana in 1950. In May 1951 Bowe competed in a contest to choose the queen of the sixth annual Home Show and Building Exposition. Along with Mary Ellen Nichols, she was a [[runner-up]] to the contest winner, Linda Peterson.

==Model==
When she arrived in [[California]], Bowe secured work as a [[model (person)|model]]. Her measurements were 36–25–36. She is 5'5" tall and has blue-green eyes. Her modeling agency was contacted by a [[high fashion]] photographer, ''Christa'', who suggested she pose for national and [[fashion magazine]] portraits.

Modeling for magazines such as ''Eye'', ''Tempo'', and ''Blightly'', she eventually made the transition from model to actress in television. Her magazine credits include a [[Life Magazine]] cover.

Bowe's look was at times likened to both [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Grace Kelly]]. She always modeled high fashion rather than lingerie or bathing suits. She was never asked by photographers to pose for [[cheesecake (pin-up)|cheesecake]] pictures as was many a [[pin-up girl]]. She once said, "Of all the auditions and interviews I have had with casting men, directors and producers, not one ever made a pass at me. I guess they were afraid of me."

==Motion pictures==
Bowe moved to [[Hollywood]] in 1950. Initially she was signed by film agent [[Charles K. Feldman]]. When his production plans stalled, she obtained a contract with [[Columbia Pictures]]. She was trained in dramatic acting by Benno Schneider. Her early experience as an entertainer included performing as a singer and dancer in amateur musicals.

As a screen [[debutante]] Bowe appeared in ''Lovely To Look At'' (1952) with [[Kathryn Grayson]] and [[Red Skelton]]. The 16 beauties showcased include [[Jane Lynn]], [[Alma Carroll]], [[Shirley Kimball]], [[Betty Sully]] and [[Honey King]]. Bowe's part is uncredited, as is her depiction of a swimmer in, ''Million Dollar Mermaid'' (1952). In 1954 she was appeared in ''The Golden Mistress'' and ''The Adventures of Hajji Baba''. The former was Bowe's first movie after requesting her release from Columbia. As "Ann Dexter," she was featured opposite [[John Agar]] in an R.K. Productions release, set in [[Haiti]]. During filming she almost drowned, was stung by a [[sea urchin]], and sustained bumps, bruises and insect bites.

Bowe was under option to [[20th Century Fox]] when she filmed ''The Peacemaker'' (1956). Based on a novel, the western also featured [[James Mitchell (actor)|James Mitchell]]. It was released by Hal R. Makelim Productions. Announced in April 1954, the Makelim plan for producing pictures "guaranteed a flow of film products through a fixed fee system."

==Marriage==
In 1956 she married [[Robert Stack]]. The couple became the parents of a daughter, Elizabeth Langford Stack, on January 20, 1957. They shared mutual passions for the outdoors, especially
sailing and riding. Stack enjoyed [[skeet shooting]] as his favorite pastime.
Rosemarie temporarily gave up her career when her children were young.

In 1970, Bowe was in an automobile accident in [[Sacramento, California]], and sustained serious internal injuries. She crashed into a
concrete culvert because of a mechanical failure in the [[rental car]]
she was driving. At the time, Stack was filming ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]''.
He chartered a flight to come and be with her.

Rosemarie Bowe is retired from show business. Her son, Charles Robert Stack, is also a retired investment banker
