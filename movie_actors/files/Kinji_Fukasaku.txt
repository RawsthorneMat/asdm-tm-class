He is known for directing the Japanese portion of the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood film]] ''[[Tora! Tora!

He was also known for his trademark [[shaky camera]] technique, which he used extensively in many of his films from the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berra|first=John|title=Directory of World Cinema: Japan|year=2010|publisher=Intellect Books|location=Bristol, UK|isbn=1-84150-335-5|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mRrpfF6g3g0C&pg=PA115|edition=1|page=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Jane|first=Ian|title=Battle Royale II (Region 3)|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13822/battle-royale-ii|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|accessdate=23 March 2012|date=30 January 2004}}</ref>

In 1997, he received the [[Medals of Honor (Japan)|Purple Medal of Honor]] from the Japanese government for his work in film.<ref name="JapTimesDeath">{{cite web|title=Renowned director Fukasaku, of ‘Battle Royale’ fame, dies|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2003/01/13/national/renowned-director-fukasaku-of-battle-royale-fame-dies/#.U_ltmWOUqQI|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Kinji Fukasaku was born in 1930 in [[Mito, Ibaraki|Mito]], [[Ibaraki Prefecture]] as the youngest of five children.<ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide">{{cite book|last1=Schilling|first1=Mark|title=The Yakuza Movie Book: A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films|publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]]|year=2003|pages=43–45|isbn=1-880656-76-0|url=http://www.stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html}}</ref> When he was 15 years old, Fukasaku's class was drafted, and he worked as a munitions worker during [[World War II]]. In July 1945, the class was caught in artillery fire. Since the children could not escape artillery fire, they had to dive under each other in order to survive. The surviving members of the class had to dispose of the corpses<ref>[http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/kinji_fukasaku.shtml Kinji Fukasaku profile], midnighteye.com; accessed 20 October 2014.</ref> After the war, he spent much of his time watching foreign films.<ref name="LA Times">{{cite web|title=Kinji Fukasaku, 72; Japanese Director of Edgy, Violent Films|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/27/local/me-fukasaku27|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref>

==Career==
Fukasaku studied cinema at [[Nihon University]], in the country's first film department, before switching to the literature department for scriptwriting his junior year. There he studied under [[Kogo Noda]] and Katsuhito Inomata. After graduating in 1953, Fukasaku became an assistant director at [[Toei Company|Toei]] in June 1954, where he worked under people such as [[Masahiro Makino]] and [[Yasushi Sasaki]].<ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide"/>

Fukasaku made his directorial debut in 1961 with the two [[featurette]]s ''[[Wandering Detective: Tragedy in Red Valley]]'' and ''[[Wandering Detective: Black Wind in the Harbor]]'', starring [[Sonny Chiba]]. His first feature length, for the [[Toei Company|New Toei subsidiary]] was ''High Noon for Gangsters'' that same year.<ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide"/> His first film for the [[Toei Company]] proper was ''The Proud Challenge'' the following year starring [[Kōji Tsuruta]]. He had his breakthrough hit in 1964 with [[Ken Takakura]] starring in ''Jakoman and Tetsu''.<ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide"/> From 1966 to 1971, he created several modern gang films for Toei usually starring Tsuruta, such as ''Kaisanshiki'' (1967), ''Bakuto Kaisanshiki'' (1968) and ''Nihon Boryokudan: Kumicho'' (1969).

Thanks to a non-exclusive contract, he also directed ''[[Black Lizard (film)|Black Lizard]]'', based on [[Yukio Mishima]]'s stage adaptation of the [[Edogawa Rampo]] novel, and ''[[Black Rose Mansion]]'' for [[Shochiku]] both of which starred the transvestite actor [[Akihiro Miwa]]. In 1968 he directed ''[[The Green Slime]]'', a United States-Japan [[science fiction]] co-production.<ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide"/>

In 1970, Fukasaku was recruited to direct the Japanese portion of another US-Japan film, ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'', after [[Akira Kurosawa]] pulled out. Using his pay from the project, he bought the rights to adapt ''[[Under the Flag of the Rising Sun]]''. The movie was critically acclaimed even being selected as Japan's entry for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[45th Academy Awards]] in 1972, although it was not accepted as a nominee. That year also saw the release of ''[[Street Mobster]]'' starring [[Bunta Sugawara]], which resulted in Toei producer Koji Shundo selecting Fukasaku to direct a groundbreaking [[yakuza film]].<ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide"/> ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' was released in 1973. Up to this point, Japan's many yakuza films had usually been tales of chivalry set in the pre-war period, but Fukasaku's ultra-violent, documentary-style film took place in chaotic post-War [[Hiroshima]]. A commercial and critical success, it gave rise to seven sequels by Fukasaku and three movies that are based on the series but directed by others. After directing several more yakuza films, ''[[Graveyard of Honor (1975 film)|Graveyard of Honor]]'' (1975), ''[[Cops vs. Thugs]]'' (1975), ''[[Yakuza Graveyard]]'' (1976), and ''[[Hokuriku Proxy War]]'' (1977), Fukasaku left the genre.<ref name="YakuzaMovieGuide"/>

He focused on historical epics; ''[[Shogun's Samurai]]'' (1978), ''[[The Fall of Ako Castle]]'' (1978), ''[[Samurai Reincarnation]]'' (1981); and science fiction; ''[[Message from Space]]'' (1978) and ''[[Virus (1980 film)|Virus]]'' (1980). ''Virus'' was Japan's most expensive production at the time, and became a financial flop. However, two years after it he directed the highly acclaimed comedy ''[[Fall Guy]]'', winning both the [[Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year]] and [[Kinema Junpo Award for Best Film of the Year]]. Fukasaku was chosen to direct 1989's ''[[Violent Cop (1989 film)|Violent Cop]]'', but a scheduling conflict caused him to pull out and [[Takeshi Kitano]] took over in his first directorial role.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schilling|first1=Mark|title=The Yakuza Movie Book : A Guide to Japanese Gangster Films|publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]]|year=2003|page=39|isbn=1-880656-76-0|url=http://www.stonebridge.com/YAKUZA/yakuza.html}}</ref>

Near the end of his life, Fukasaku branched out into the world of video games by serving as the director of the [[Capcom]]/[[Sunsoft]] [[survival horror]] game ''[[Clock Tower 3]]''. In 2000, ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' was released. The highly controversial film received positive critical praise and became a major financial success, grossing ¥3.11 billion domestically.<ref>{{cite web|title=Violent movie opens despite protest|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2000/12/17/national/violent-movie-opens-despite-protest/#.U_lwYWOUqQI|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accj.or.jp/document_library/Journal/1053151390.pdf|title= Japan Goes to the Movies|accessdate=8 January 2007|last=J.T.|first=Testar|date= June 2002|format=PDF|publisher=The Journal|page=1}}</ref>

Fukasaku announced he had [[prostate cancer]] in September 2002.<ref name="JapTimesDeath"/> In late December 2002, shortly after filming began on ''[[Battle Royale II: Requiem]]'', he was hospitalized when his condition worsened. Fukasaku died at a Tokyo hospital on January 12, 2003, aged 72.<ref name="JapTimesDeath"/> Having directed only a single scene, his son, [[Kenta Fukasaku|Kenta]] took over the film.
