'''Norman Eugene Walker''', known as '''Clint Walker''' (born May 30, 1927), is a retired [[Americans|American]] [[actor]]. He is perhaps best known for his cowboy role as "Cheyenne Bodie" in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] [[Western (genre)#Film|western]] television series, ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]''.

==Life and career==
Walker was born in [[Hartford, Illinois|Hartford]] in [[Madison County, Illinois|Madison County]], southwestern [[Illinois]], the son of Gladys Huldah (Schwanda) and Paul Arnold Walker.<ref name="bio">[http://www.clintwalker.com/display_html.php?page=/html/bio.html Walker's biography] from his official website</ref><ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=73186509 Neoma Lucy Walker Westbrook]</ref> His mother was Czech.<ref>https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KWRK-P1R</ref> He left school to work at a factory and on a river boat, then joined the [[United States Merchant Marine]] at the age of seventeen in the last months of [[World War II]].<ref name="bio"/> After leaving the Merchant Marine, he labored at odd jobs in [[Brownwood, Texas]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]], and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he worked as a [[doorman (profession)|doorman]] at the [[Sands Hotel]].<ref name="bio"/> He was also employed as a sheet metal worker and a nightclub bouncer.

He became a client of [[Henry Willson]], who renamed him "Jett Norman"<ref>p.507 Aaker, Everett Television Western Players of the Fifties: A Biographical Encyclopedia of All Regular Cast Members in Western Series, 1949-1959' McFarland, 1997</ref> and cast him to appear in a [[Bowery Boys]] film (''[[Jungle Gents]]'') as a [[Tarzan]]-type character.

In [[Los Angeles]], he was hired by [[Cecil B. DeMille]] to appear in ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''. A friend in the film industry helped get him a few bit parts that brought him to the attention of Warner Bros., which was developing a [[western film|western style]] television series.

Walker's good looks and imposing physique (he stood 6&nbsp;feet, 6&nbsp;inches [198&nbsp;cm] tall with a 48-inch chest and a 32-inch waist<ref name="idaho">[http://www.kirbyjonas.com/articles/ISJ-Dec2003.html Cowboy actor inspires local Western writer], a December 2003 review transcribed from an ''[[Idaho State Journal]]'' article</ref>) helped him land an audition where he won the lead role in the TV series ''Cheyenne''. Billed as "Clint" Walker, he was cast as Cheyenne Bodie, a roaming cowboy hero in the post-[[American Civil War]] era. While the series regularly capitalized on Walker's rugged frame with frequent bare-chested scenes, it was well written and acted. It proved hugely popular for eight seasons.  Walker's pleasant baritone singing voice was also occasionally utilized on the series and led Warner Brothers to produce an album of Walker doing traditional songs and ballads.<ref>[http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/info/MediaRelease.aspx?ID=65 Actor Clint Walker to be Inducted into National Cowboy Museum's Hall of Great Western Performers]</ref>

Walker then played roles in several big-screen films, including a trio of westerns for [[Gordon Douglas (director)|Gordon Douglas]]: ''[[Fort Dobbs]]'' in 1958, ''[[Yellowstone Kelly]]'' in 1959, and ''[[Gold of the Seven Saints]]'' in 1961, the comedy ''[[Send Me No Flowers]]'' in 1964, the actual leading role despite being billed under [[Frank Sinatra]] in the wartime drama ''[[None but the Brave]]'' in 1965, ''[[The Night of the Grizzly]]'' in 1966, and as the meek [[convict]] Samson Posey in the war drama ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' in 1967. In 1969, New York Times film critic Howard Thompson, in reviewing Walker's performance in the movie ''[[More Dead Than Alive]]'', described the actor as "a big, fine-looking chap and about as live-looking as any man could be. And there is something winning about his taciturn earnestness as an actor, although real emotion seldom breaks through".<ref>Howard Thompson, "'Dead' Western", The New York Times, May 1, 1969</ref> In 1958, Thompson described the actor, then starring in ''Fort Dobbs'', as "the biggest, finest-looking Western hero ever to sag a horse, with a pair of shoulders rivaling King Kong's".<ref>"Western and 'Lafayette Escadrille' Open", The New York Times, April 19, 1958</ref>

During the 1970s he returned to television, starring in a number of made-for-TV [[western films]] as well as a short-lived series in 1974 called ''[[Kodiak (TV series)|Kodiak]]''. He starred in the [[made-for-television]] [[cult film]] ''[[Killdozer! (film)|Killdozer!]]'' the same year. In 1998, he voiced Nick Nitro in the film ''[[Small Soldiers]]''.

==Literary pursuits==
Walker met western author Kirby Jonas through [[James Drury]], a mutual friend. Jonas and Walker subsequently spent two years collaborating on a storyline by Walker involving gold and the [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]], a partnership that led to the publication of the [[2003 in literature|2003]] [[Western fiction|Western novel]] ''Yaqui Gold'' (ISBN 978-1-891423-08-6).<ref name="idaho"/>

==Honors==
Clint Walker has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1505 [[Vine Street]], near its intersection with [[Sunset Boulevard]] (approximate coordinates: {{Coord|34.098084|-118.326643|display=inline|region:US_scale:1000}}).

In 2004, he was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].
