'''Clara Williams''' (May 3, 1888 &ndash; May 8, 1928) was an American [[silent film]] actress.  Along with [[Louise Glaum]] and [[Dorothy Dalton]], she was one of the principal leading ladies at [[Thomas H. Ince#Inceville - The First Modern Studio|Inceville]], one of the first motion picture studios to make feature films in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].  Williams appeared in more than one hundred films between 1910 and 1918, including starring roles in ''[[The Italian (1915 film)|The Italian]]'' and [[William S. Hart]]'s western, ''[[Hell's Hinges]]'', both of which are included in the [[National Film Registry]]. When she married director [[Reginald Barker]] at age 31, she retired from acting.

==Early life and career==
Clara Williams was born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and made her screen debut in ''Western Chivalry'' in 1910. The following year, a half page article and photo of Williams was featured in the debut issue of ''[[Motion Picture Magazine|Motion Picture Story]]'' magazine making her the first film actress to appear in a [[fan magazine]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Slide|first=Anthony|title=Inside the Hollywood Fan Magazine: A History of Star Makers, Fabricators, and Gossip Mongers|year=2010|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=1-604-73414-0|page=18}}</ref> The success of ''[[The Italian (1915 film)|The Italian]]'' (1915), in which she played the wife of an immigrant, resulted in her being typecast in roles as Latin characters. In 1917, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted, "Heretofore she has been known almost exclusively as a portrayer of Latin parts, simply because she was such success in that sort of a role in ''The Italian'', in which she played the leading part opposite [[George Beban]]."<ref name=Style>{{cite news|title=Clara Williams Wants Old Style|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=November 4, 1917}}</ref>

In 1917, Williams and several other of the important actors and directors from Inceville left the studio to join the newly formed Paralta Company. The ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote, "Now that she is at the head of her own company and has the right to choose her own stories, she will have all the freedom in the world to show her versatility."<ref name=Style/>  Williams first film with Paralta, and also the last film in her acting career, was a story of the Klondike Gold Rush, ''Carmen of the Klondike''.<ref name=Style/><ref>{{cite news|title=Carmen of the Klondike|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 15, 1918}}</ref>

During her years with the Triangle studios, Williams had become known for her many gowns, and the phrase "forty famous frocks" was coined to describe her wardrobe.<ref name=Frock/> When Williams left Triangle for Paralta, the ''Los Angeles Times'' asked whether the famous frocks would move with her. It reported, "Clara is now in a quandary. She wants to get some more frocks, but if she does it will spoil the phrase 'forty famous frocks,' and that would never do."<ref name=Frock>{{cite news|title=Her Forty Frocks: Clara Williams Takes Them to the Paralta Company|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=September 9, 1917}}</ref>

While working at the Ince studios, Williams met director [[Reginald Barker]]. He directed her in numerous films, including ''The Man from Oregon'' (1915), ''The Criminal'' (1916), ''Three of Many'' (1917), ''Paws of the Bear'' (1917), ''The One Woman'' (1918), and ''Carmen of the Klondike'' (1918), which was her last screen appearance. She married Barker in February 1920 and retired.<ref name=Obit/>

==Later years and death==
In 1925, the ''Los Angeles Times'' interviewed the former movie star who the ''Times'' reported was "now just a housewife."<ref name=Glad/> At the time, Williams said that she and her husband had never had a quarrel and defended her new domestic life by stating, "To me there is no comparison in the amount of pleasure to be enjoyed from home life as opposed to a career."<ref name=Glad>{{cite news|title=Married and Very Glad of It: Film Pair Happy After Five Years|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=February 8, 1925}}</ref>

In late February 1928, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that Williams had undergone a major surgery for an undisclosed condition at the California Lutheran Hospital.<ref>{{cite news|title=Barker's Wife Has Operation|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=February 23, 1928}}</ref>  On May 8, 1928, she died at her Los Angeles home at age 40 following what the media reported as "a prolonged illness."<ref name=Obit>{{cite news|title=Funeral of Mrs. Barker Not Decided |publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 9, 1928}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&dat=19280509&id=0ccqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ScwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3725,5607209|title=Clara Williams Former Star Dies|date=May 8, 1928|work=The Deseret News|page=8|accessdate=June 10, 2014}}</ref>  She was survived by her husband and a brother.  Her funeral was held at the Little Church of the Flowers, and her remains were cremated at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Barker Funeral Hour Announced|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=May 10, 1928}}</ref>
