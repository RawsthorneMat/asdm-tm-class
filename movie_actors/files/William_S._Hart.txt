'''William Surrey Hart''' (December 6, 1864 – June 23, 1946) was an American [[silent film]] actor, screenwriter, director and producer.<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', June 26, 1946, page 62.</ref> He is remembered as a foremost western star of the silent era who "imbued all of his characters with honor and integrity."<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/25/entertainment/la-et-classic-hollywood-20110725 publisher=The Los Angeles Times]</ref>

==Biography==
Hart was born in [[Newburgh (town), New York|Newburgh, New York]], to Nicholas Hart (c1834-1895) and Rosanna Hart (c1839–1909). William had 2 brothers, who died very young, and 4 sisters. His father was born in England, and his mother was born in Ireland.

He began his acting career on stage in his 20s, and in film when he was 49, which coincided with the beginning of film's transition from curiosity to commercial art form.<ref>[http://www.hartmuseum.org/more.html William S. Hart Ranch and Museum]</ref> Hart’s stage debut came in 1888 as a member of a company headed by [[Daniel E. Bandmann]]. The following year he joined [[Lawrence Barrett|Lawrence Barrett’s]] company in New York and  later spent several seasons with [[Hortense Rhéa|Mlle. Hortense Rhéa’s]] traveling company.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=QaCdoNBKSn0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22William+S.+Hart:+Projecting+the+American+West%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=v6gTU4XuGdTjoAT1u4H4Bg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Davis, Ronald L., 2003. ''William S. Hart: Projecting the American West'' - pp. 28-32] Retrieved March 2, 2014</ref> He toured and traveled extensively while trying to make a name for himself as an actor, and for a time directed shows at the [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] Opera House in North Carolina, around the year 1900. He had some success as a [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] actor on Broadway, working with [[Margaret Mather]] and other stars; he appeared in the original 1899 stage production of ''[[Ben-Hur (play)|Ben-Hur]].'' His family had moved to Asheville but, after his youngest sister Lotta died of typhoid fever in 1901, they all left together for [[Brooklyn]] until William went back on tour.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=QaCdoNBKSn0C&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=william+s+hart+cowboy+actor+asheville&source=bl&ots=9MoWWz3OsL&sig=FPp-4zeD3I_TjQ7yCZF9Rl_MToc&hl=en&ei=V9__S8m9EoPCNrSW8Ds&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CD0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref>

Hart went on to become one of the first great stars of the motion picture [[Western (genre)|western]].  Fascinated by the Old West, he acquired [[Billy the Kid]]'s [[Revolver|"six shooters"]] and was a friend of legendary lawmen [[Wyatt Earp]] and [[Bat Masterson]]. He entered films in 1914 where, after playing supporting roles in two short films, he achieved stardom as the lead in the feature ''[[The Bargain (1914 film)|The Bargain]]''. Hart was particularly interested in making realistic western films. His films are noted for their authentic [[costumes]] and [[Theatrical property|props]], as well as Hart's extraordinary acting ability, honed on Shakespearean theater stages in the United States and England.

Beginning in 1915, Hart starred in his own series of two-reel western short subjects for producer [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]], which were so popular that they were supplanted by a series of feature films. Many of Hart's early films continued to play in theaters, under new titles, for another decade. In 1915 and 1916 exhibitors voted him the biggest money making star in the US.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article25919793 |title=SHOOTIN FAME. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 – 1954)]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=August 27, 1942 |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In 1917 Hart accepted a lucrative offer from [[Adolph Zukor]] to join [[Famous Players|Famous Players-Lasky]], which merged into [[Paramount Pictures]]. In the films Hart began to ride a brown and white [[Pinto horse|pinto]] he called ''Fritz''. Fritz was the forerunner of later famous movie horses known by their own name, e.g., horses like Tom Mix's ''Tony'', Roy Rogers's ''[[Trigger (horse)|Trigger]]'' and Clayton Moore's ''[[Silver (horse)|Silver]]''. Hart was now making feature films exclusively, and films like ''Square Deal Sanderson'' and ''The Toll Gate'' were popular with fans. Hart married young Hollywood actress [[Winifred Westover]]. Although their marriage was short-lived, they had one child, William S. Hart, Jr. (1922 – 2004).

By the early 1920s, however, Hart's brand of gritty, rugged westerns with drab costumes and moralistic themes gradually fell out of fashion. The public became attracted by a new kind of movie cowboy, epitomized by [[Tom Mix]], who wore flashier costumes and was faster with the action. Paramount dropped Hart, who then made one last bid for his kind of western. He produced ''[[Tumbleweeds (1925 film)|Tumbleweeds]]'' (1925) with his own money, arranging to release it independently through [[United Artists]]. The film turned out well, with an epic land-rush sequence, but did only fair business at the box office. Hart was angered by United Artists' failure to promote his film properly and sued United Artists. The legal proceedings dragged on for years, and the courts finally ruled in Hart's favor, in 1940.

[[File:WSHart House.jpg|left|thumb|Hart's ranch home, "La Loma de los Vientos" in [[Newhall, California]], built between 1924 and 1928 in the [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style]], is currently a museum]]

After ''Tumbleweeds'', Hart retired to his [[Newhall, California]], ranch home, "La Loma de los Vientos,” which was designed by architect [[Arthur Rolland Kelly|Arthur R. Kelly]]. In 1939 he appeared in his only sound film, a spoken prologue for a reissue of  ''Tumbleweeds''. The 75-year-old Hart, filmed on location at his Newhall ranch, reflects on the Old West and recalls his silent-movie days fondly. The speech turned out to be William S. Hart's farewell to the screen, and it's a fitting valedictory. Most prints and video versions of  ''Tumbleweeds'' circulating today include Hart's speech. Hart died on June 23, 1946, in [[Newhall, California]] at the age of 81. He was buried in [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York.

==Dedications==
For his contribution to the motion picture industry, William S. Hart has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6363 Hollywood Blvd. In 1975, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].

As part of the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]], California, Hart's former home and 260-acre (1.1&nbsp;km²) ranch in Newhall is now William S. Hart Park. The [[William S. Hart High School District]] as well as [[Hart High School (California)|William S. Hart Senior High School]], both located in the Santa Clarita Valley in the northern part of Los Angeles County, were named in his honor. A Santa Clarita baseball field complex is named in his honor.

On November 10, 1962, Hart was honored posthumously in an episode of the short-lived ''[[The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show]]'', a western variety program on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].
