Bell returned to the screen for two more films in 1942.

==Political career==

In 1944 Bell ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] on the Republican ticket against Democrat [[Berkeley Bunker]]. The ''[[Nevada State Journal]]'' commented on November 1: "He has made friends where ever he appeared but consensus is that the time is too short to overcome a handicap of not being so well known as his opponent".<ref>Nevada State Journal, November 1, 1944</ref> The election was held November 7, and Bell got 19,096 votes against Bunker who received 36,648.<ref>Nevada State Journal, November 18, 1944</ref>

Bell was the leader of the [[Nevada Republican Party]] and in 1948 was an alternate to the [[1948 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. He was also active in the Nevada Chamber of Commerce and Boy Scouts.<ref>[http://www.nevadaday.com/parade/grandmarshals/1953.htm Nevada Day Grand Marshals]</ref>

The ties Bell forged during those years helped him win the lieutenant governor's office in 1954.  That year [[Charles H. Russell]], the incumbent GOP governor, also won.  In 1958 Democrat Grant Sawyer unseated Russell, but Bell won re-election as lieutenant governor. He died in office in 1962.

His final film appearance was a brief cameo as a cowboy in [[John Huston]]'s film ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961), which was shot on location in Nevada. He appeared in the film with actress [[Marilyn Monroe]], who died a month after Rex in the summer of 1962.

==Personal life==
Rex was born in Chicago and married actress [[Clara Bow]] in 1931.<ref name=lvrj20001119/> They had two sons, Tony Beldam (1934-2011, changed name to Rex Anthony Bell, Jr.) and George Beldam, Jr. (born 1938).<ref>[http://www.b-westerns.com/rexbell.htm B-Westerns]</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= Mordaunt|last= Hall|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Movies |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/613297/Rex-Bell |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2008-04-11 }}</ref>  Rex Bell Jr appeared in two Western films ''[[Stage to Thunder Rock]]'' (1964) in the role of "Shotgun Rex" and ''[[Young Fury]]'' (1965).
