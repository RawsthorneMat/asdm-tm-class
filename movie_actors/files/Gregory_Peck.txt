'''Eldred Gregory Peck''' (April 5, 1916 – June 12, 2003) was an American [[actor]]. One of the world's most popular film stars from the 1940s to the 1960s, Peck continued to play major film roles until the late 1970s. His performance as [[Atticus Finch]] in the 1962 film ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. He had also been nominated for an Oscar for the same category for ''[[The Keys of the Kingdom (film)|The Keys of the Kingdom]]'' (1944), ''[[The Yearling (film)|The Yearling]]'' (1946), ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947) and ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]'' (1949).  Other notable films he appeared in include ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (1947), ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953), ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956) (and its [[Moby Dick (1998 miniseries)|1998 miniseries of the same name]]), ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961), ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'' (1962) (and its [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|1991 remake of the same name]]), ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), ''[[The Omen]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' (1978).

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] honored Peck with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1969 for his lifetime [[humanitarian]] efforts. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] named Peck among the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|Greatest Male Stars of All Time]], ranking at No. 12. He was named to the [[International Best Dressed List]] Hall of Fame in 1983.<ref>[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/bestdressed/bestdressed_men ''Vanity Fair'']</ref>

==Early life==
Eldred Gregory Peck was born on April 5, 1916 in the [[San Diego|San Diego, California]] neighborhood of [[La Jolla]], the son of Gregory Pearl Peck, a New York-born chemist and pharmacist, and his [[Missouri]]-born wife Bernice Mary "Bunny" (née Ayres).<ref>http://www.americanancestors.org/assortment-famous-actors/</ref> His father was of Irish (maternal) and English (paternal) heritage,<ref>Freedland, Michael. ''Gregory Peck: A Biography''. New York: [[William Morrow and Company]]. 1980. ISBN 0-688-03619-8 p.10</ref><ref>United States Census records for La Jolla, California 1910</ref> while his mother had Scottish and English ancestry.<ref>United States Census records for [[St. Louis, Missouri]] – 1860, 1870, 1880, 1900, 1910</ref> Peck's father was [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], while his mother converted to Roman Catholicism when she married his father. Through his Irish-born paternal grandmother Catherine Ashe, Peck was related to [[Thomas Ashe]], who took part in the [[Easter Rising]] less than three weeks after Peck's birth and died while on [[hunger strike]] in 1917. Peck's parents divorced by the time he was six years old;  his maternal grandmother raised him for the next few years.<ref>
Freedland, pp. 12–18</ref>

Peck attended a Catholic military school, St. John's Military Academy, in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] at the age of 10. His grandmother died while he was enrolled there, and his father again took over his upbringing. At 14, Peck attended [[San Diego High School]] and lived with his father.<ref>Freedland, pp. 16–19</ref> When he graduated, he enrolled briefly at San Diego State Teacher's College, (now known as [[San Diego State University]]), joined the track team, took his first theatre and public-speaking courses, and joined the [[Epsilon Eta]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gregory Peck: A Biography|last=Fishgall|first=Barry|year=2002|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York City|isbn=0-684-85290-X|pages=36–37|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NJId3XPaeR0C&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=San+Diego+State+University+gregory+peck&source=bl&ots=eDnTPiiRfr&sig=ttqHRhb21XAeRiY8_UiTQSWQPzU&hl=en&ei=LhJxSvzAK-aStgf8gaWBDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2#v=onepage&q=San%20Diego%20State%20University%20gregory%20peck&f=false}}</ref> He stayed for just one academic year, thereafter obtaining admission to his first-choice college, the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>Thomas, Tony. ''Gregory Peck''. Pyramid Publications, 1977, p. 16</ref>  For a short time, he took a job driving a truck for an oil company. In 1936, he declared himself a [[pre-medical]] student at Berkeley, and majored in English. Standing {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}}, he [[College rowing (United States)|rowed on the university crew]].

The Berkeley acting coach saw Peck as perfect material for university theater. Peck developed an interest in acting and was recruited by [[Edwin Duerr]], director of the university's Little Theater. He appeared in five plays during his senior year. Although his tuition fee was only $26 per year, Peck still struggled to pay, and had to work as a "hasher" (kitchen helper) for the [[Gamma Phi Beta]] [[sorority]] in exchange for meals. Peck would later say about Berkeley that, "it was a very special experience for me and three of the greatest years of my life. It woke me up and made me a human being."<ref name="berkmag">{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/magazine/summer_96/departments/aroundcal/peck.html|title="Gregory Peck comes home," '&#39;Berkeley Magazine'&#39;, Summer 1996|publisher=Berkeley.edu|date=2000-07-04}}</ref> In 1997, Peck donated $25,000 to the Berkeley rowing crew in honor of his coach, the renowned [[Ky Ebright]].

==Acting career==

===Stage===
After graduating from Berkeley with a BA degree in English, Peck dropped the name "Eldred" and headed to [[New York City]] to study at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] with the legendary acting teacher [[Sanford Meisner]]. He was often broke and sometimes slept in [[Central Park]].<ref>Freedland, p. 35</ref> He worked at the 1939 [[World's Fair]] and as a tour guide for [[NBC]]'s television broadcasting. In 1940, Peck learned more of the acting craft, working in exchange for food, at the [[Barter Theatre]] in [[Abingdon, Virginia]], appearing in five plays including ''Family Portrait'' and ''On Earth As It Is''.<ref>"Gregory Peck Returns to Theatre Roots in Virginia Mountains," Playbill, June 29, 1998</ref>

His stage career began in 1941 when he played the secretary in a [[Katharine Cornell]] production of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[The Doctor's Dilemma (play)|The Doctor's Dilemma]]''. Unfortunately, the play opened in [[San Francisco]] just one week before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].<ref>Tad Mosel, ''Leading Lady: The World and Theatre of Katharine Cornell'', Boston: Little, Brown & Co. 1978{{page needed|date=June 2013}}</ref> He made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut as the lead in [[Emlyn Williams]]' ''[[The Morning Star (play)|The Morning Star]]'' in 1942. His second Broadway performance that year was in ''[[The Willow and I]]'' with [[Edward Pawley]]. Peck's acting abilities were in high demand during [[World War II]] because he was exempt from military service owing to a back injury suffered while receiving dance and movement lessons from [[Martha Graham]] as part of his acting training. [[Twentieth Century Fox]] claimed he had injured his back while rowing at university, but in Peck's words, "In Hollywood, they didn't think a dance class was macho enough, I guess. I've been trying to straighten out that story for years."<ref name="sdut">Welton Jones. [http://www.jefflangonline.com/peck/bio/index.htm "Gregory Peck,"] ''San Diego Union-Tribune'', April 5, 1998</ref>

In 1947, Peck co-founded [[The La Jolla Playhouse]], at his birthplace, with [[Mel Ferrer]] and [[Dorothy McGuire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lajollaplayhouse.org/about-the-playhouse/playhouse-highlights |title=Playhouse Highlights |publisher=La Jolla Playhouse |accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref> This local community theater and landmark (now in a new home at the [[University of California, San Diego]]) still thrives today. It has attracted [[Hollywood]] film stars on hiatus both as performers and enthusiastic supporters since its inception.

===Film===

[[File:Snows kilimanjaro gregory peck.jpg|thumb|right|Gregory Peck in ''[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (1952 film)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]'', 1952]]
Peck's first film, ''[[Days of Glory (1944 film)|Days of Glory]]'', was released in 1944. He was nominated for the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] five times, four of which came in his first five years of film acting: for ''[[The Keys of the Kingdom (film)|The Keys of the Kingdom]]'' (1944), ''[[The Yearling (film)|The Yearling]]'' (1946), ''[[Gentleman's Agreement]]'' (1947), and ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]'' (1949).

''The Keys of the Kingdom'' emphasized his stately presence. As the farmer Ezra "Penny" Baxter in ''[[The Yearling (film)|The Yearling]]'', his good-humored warmth and affection toward the characters playing his son and wife confounded critics who had been insisting he was a lifeless performer. ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946) showed his range as an actor in his first "against type" role as a cruel, libidinous gunslinger. ''Gentleman's Agreement'' established his power in the "social conscience" genre in a film that took on the deep-seated but subtle [[antisemitism]] of mid-century corporate America. ''Twelve O'Clock High'' was the first of many successful war films in which Peck embodied the brave, effective, yet human fighting man.

Among his other films were ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945), ''[[The Paradine Case]]'' (1947), ''[[The Gunfighter]]'' (1950), ''[[Moby Dick (1956 film)|Moby Dick]]'' (1956), ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' (1956), ''[[On the Beach (1959 film)|On the Beach]]'' (1959), which brought to life the terrors of global nuclear war, ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961), and ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953), with [[Audrey Hepburn]] in her [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning role. Peck and Hepburn were close friends until her death; Peck even introduced her to her first husband, [[Mel Ferrer]]. Peck once again teamed up with director [[William Wyler]] in the epic Western ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), which he co-produced. Peck won the Academy Award with his fifth nomination, playing [[Atticus Finch]], a Depression-era lawyer and widowed father, in a [[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|film adaptation]] of the [[Harper Lee]] novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]''. Released in 1962 during the height of the [[US civil rights movement]] in the [[U.S. Southern States|South]], this film and his role were Peck's favorites. In 2003, Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains|was named the greatest film hero of the past 100 years]] by the [[American Film Institute]].<ref>http://www.afi.com/100years/handv.aspx</ref>

[[File:Gregory Peck Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|upright|Peck in 1973, by [[Allan Warren]]]]

Peck served as the president of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] in 1967, [[Chairman]] of the Board of Trustees of the [[American Film Institute]] from 1967 to 1969, Chairman of the Motion Picture and Television Relief Fund in 1971, and National Chairman of the [[American Cancer Society]] in 1966. He was a member of the National Council on the Arts from 1964 to 1966.<ref>Freedland, pp. 191–195</ref>

A physically powerful man, he was known to do a majority of his own fight scenes, rarely using body or stunt doubles. In fact, [[Robert Mitchum]], his on-screen opponent in ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'', told about the time Peck once accidentally punched him for real during their final fight scene in the movie. He felt the impact for days afterward. Peck's rare attempts at villainous roles were not acclaimed. Early on, he played the renegade son in the Western ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' and, later in his career, the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele in ''[[The Boys from Brazil (film)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' co-starring [[Laurence Olivier]].<ref>Freedland, pp. 242–243</ref>

===Later work===
In the 1980s, Peck moved to television, where he starred in the mini-series ''The Blue and the Gray'', playing [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He also starred with [[Christopher Plummer]], [[John Gielgud]], and [[Barbara Bouchet]] in the television film ''[[The Scarlet and The Black]]'', about [[Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty]], a real-life Catholic priest in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] who smuggled Jews and other refugees away from the [[Nazism|Nazis]] during [[World War II]].
[[File:Gregory..jpg|left|thumb|At the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2000.]]

Peck, Mitchum, and [[Martin Balsam]] all had roles in the [[Cape Fear (1991 film)|1991 remake of ''Cape Fear'']] directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]. All three were in the original [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|1962 version]]. In the remake, Peck played Max Cady's lawyer.

His last prominent film role also came in 1991, in ''[[Other People's Money]]'', directed by [[Norman Jewison]] and based on the stage play of that name. Peck played a business owner trying to save his company against a hostile takeover bid by a Wall Street liquidator played by [[Danny DeVito]].

Peck retired from active film-making at that point. Peck spent the last few years of his life touring the world doing speaking engagements in which he would show clips from his movies, reminisce, and take questions from the audience. He did come out of retirement for a 1998 miniseries version of one of his most famous films, ''[[Moby Dick (1998 miniseries)|Moby Dick]]'', portraying Father Mapple (played by [[Orson Welles]] in the 1956 version), with [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]], the role Peck played in the earlier film. It would be his final performance, and it won him the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film]].

Peck had been offered the role of [[Grandpa Joe]] in the 2005 film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', but died before he could accept it. The Irish actor [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] was then given the part.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Politics==
In 1947, while many Hollywood figures were being [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklist]]ed for similar activities, Peck signed a letter deploring a [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] investigation of alleged communists in the film industry.

A lifelong supporter of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], Peck was suggested in 1970 as a possible Democratic candidate to run against [[Ronald Reagan]] for the office of [[Governor of California|California Governor]]. Although he later admitted that he had no interest in being a candidate himself for public office, Peck encouraged one of his sons, Carey Peck, to run for political office. Carey was defeated both times by slim margins in races in 1978 and 1980 against Republican U.S. Representative [[Bob Dornan]], another former actor.

In an interview with the Irish media, Peck revealed that former President [[Lyndon Johnson]] had told him that, had he sought re-election in 1968, he intended to offer Peck the post of U.S. [[ambassador]] to Ireland – a post Peck, owing to his Irish ancestry, said he might well have taken, saying "[It] would have been a great adventure".<ref>Haggerty, Bridget. [http://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/AMisc/GregoryPeck.html "Gregory Peck's Irish Connections"]. IrishCultureAndCustoms.com</ref> The actor's biographer [[Michael Freedland]] substantiates the report and says that Johnson indicated that his presentation of the Medal of Freedom to Peck would perhaps make up for his inability to confer the ambassadorship.<ref>Freedland, p. 197</ref> President [[Richard Nixon]], though, placed Peck on his [[Master list of Nixon political opponents|enemies list]] owing to his [[Liberalism|liberal]] activism.<ref>Corliss, Richard. [http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,458777,00.html "The American as Noble Man"]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. June 16, 2003</ref>

Peck was outspoken against the [[Vietnam War]], while remaining supportive of his son, Stephen, who fought there. In 1972, Peck produced the film version of [[Daniel Berrigan]]'s play ''The Trial of the [[Catonsville Nine]]'' about the prosecution of a group of Vietnam protesters for civil disobedience. Despite his reservations about American general [[Douglas MacArthur]] as a man, Peck had long wanted to play him on film, and did so in ''[[MacArthur (film)|MacArthur]]'' in 1976.<ref>Freedland, pp. 231–241</ref>

In 1978, Peck traveled to [[Alabama]], the setting of ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' to campaign for Democratic [[U.S. Senate]] nominee [[Donald W. Stewart]] of [[Anniston, Alabama|Anniston]], who defeated the Republican candidate, [[James D. Martin]], a former U.S. representative from [[Gadsden, Alabama|Gadsden]].

In 1987, Peck undertook the voice-overs for television commercials opposing President Reagan's [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] nomination of conservative judge [[Robert Bork]].<ref>{{cite web|author="" |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpFe10lkF3Y |title=1987 Robert Bork TV ad, narrated by Gregory Peck|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref> Bork's nomination was defeated. Peck was also a vocal supporter of a worldwide ban of [[nuclear weapons]], and a lifelong advocate of [[gun control]].<ref>Srteve Profitt [http://articles.latimes.com/2000/nov/05/opinion/op-47269 "Gregory Peck: A Leading Hollywood Liberal Still Can't Put Down a Good Book"], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 5, 2000</ref><ref name=Fishgall>{{cite book|last=Fishgall|first=Gary|title=Gregory Peck : a biography|year=2002|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|isbn=0-684-85290-X|page=Introduction p.14|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NJId3XPaeR0C&pg=PA14&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false|quote="But he shares with his characters a passion for the ideals in which he believes.

==Personal life and death==
[[File:PeckTomb.jpg|thumb|Gregory Peck's tomb in Los Angeles]]
In October 1942, Peck married [[Finnish-American|Finnish-born]] [[Greta Kukkonen]] (1911–2008), with whom he had three sons, Jonathan (1944–75), Stephen (b. 1946), and Carey Paul (b. 1949). They were divorced on December 30, 1955.

During his marriage with Greta, Peck had a brief affair with ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' costar [[Ingrid Bergman]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Haney|first=Lynn|title=''Gregory Peck: A Charmed Life''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YGqLGiJl69oC&pg=PT31&dq=ingrid+bergman+gregory+peck&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WTdKVbScFMG1sQTFq4DABg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=ingrid%20bergman%20gregory%20peck&f=false|year=2009|isbn=9780786737819|publisher=De Capo Press}}</ref>  He confessed the affair to Brad Darrach of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' in a 1987 interview, saying "All I can say is that I had a real love for her (Bergman), and I think that's where I ought to stop...

On December 31, 1955, the day after his divorce was finalized, Peck married [[Veronique Peck|Veronique Passani]] (1932–2012), a [[Paris]] news reporter who had interviewed him in 1952 before he went to [[Italy]] to film ''[[Roman Holiday]]''. He asked her to lunch six months later and they became inseparable. They had a son, Anthony Peck (b. 1956),<ref>Gary Fishgall, ''Gregory Peck: A Biography'', Simon and Schuster, 2002 p196</ref> and a daughter, [[Cecilia Peck]]. The couple remained married until Gregory Peck's death. His daughter Cecilia lives in Los Angeles.

Peck had grandchildren from both marriages.<ref>{{Citation | last = Snyder | first = Louis | title = Aiglon College Alumni Eagle Association | type = graduation address | date = July 3, 2010 | url = http://www.afi.com/100years/handv.aspx}}.</ref>
