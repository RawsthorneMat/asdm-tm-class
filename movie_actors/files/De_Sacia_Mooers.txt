'''De Sacia Mooers''' (November 19, 1888 â€“ January 11, 1960) was a film actress, disputably from [[Los Angeles, California]].

==Disputed Origins==
Newspaper accounts of the era differ as to her birthplace. At the time, it was common for the various studios to exaggerate or fabricate an actor's biography to make them seem more exotic and interesting to the general public. One report contends that she was a Los Angeles native and a member of the [[California]] Saville family. The Savilles were among California's pioneer settlers. Another article says that Mooers was from [[New York]]. Yet another source has her birthplace as [[Michigan]].<ref>http://www.citwf.com/person305558.htm</ref> A 1927 movie review described her ancestry as [[French people|French]]-[[Dutch people|Dutch]].

==Searcher==
In October 1920 Mooers was enticed by [[St. Louis Cardinals]] owner, Warren ''Fuzzy'' Anderson to locate his nephew, Jimmy Anderson. Fuzzy Anderson was once a partner of [[Henry Ford]]. He handled foreign distribution for [[Ford Motor Company]] parts. He had no other close relatives to leave his wealth to aside from Jimmie, who left [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1918.

Mooers resided at the Canterbury Inn on Westlake Avenue in Los Angeles while she performed her investigation. She was promised a diamond necklace by the baseball owner if she could find Jimmie. The nephew was rumored to have relocated to [[Hollywood]] and become a [[stunt man]] in motion pictures.

== Vamp ==
Mooers began working on a series of [[Femme fatale|vamp]] roles starting with ''[[The Blonde Vampire]]'' in 1922. Mooers was writing a book at the time. It was due to be published when the vamp film was released. A natural [[Blond#Evolution of blond hair|blond]], Mooers defied the [[stereotype]] of a vamp having to have [[Black hair|dark hair]].

==Movie career==
She began her career with [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions]]. At first she was known as De Sacia Saville. In the comedy ''[[Potash and Perlmutter]]'' (1923), she was cast with [[Martha Mansfield]] and [[Ben Lyon]]. Mooers appeared in over one hundred movies in the [[silent film]] era. Among her co-stars were [[Tom Mix]] and [[Warner Baxter]]. Mooers made ''Lonesome Ladies'' (1927), a [[First National Pictures]] comedy-drama about romance and marital strife. The screenplay was written by [[Lenore Coffee]] and the film featured [[Lewis Stone]] and [[Anna Q. Nilsson]].

Her final movie was a western, ''[[The Arizona Kid (1930 film)|The Arizona Kid]]'' (1930). It stars Baxter, [[Carole Lombard]] and [[Mona Maris]].

Mooers also performed on stage in [[New York City]].

==Difficult Marriage==
Mooers became the wife of Edward Demarest Mooers, owner of the Yellow Aster gold mine in [[Randsburg, California]]. It was the richest gold mine in the United States. The couple married in 1917 and divorced in May 1925. ''Eddie'' Mooers' family disapproved of Mooers' career from the time she left her home on [[Alvarado Terrace Historic District|Alvarado Terrace]], barely out of her teens. An agreement was made in which representatives of the wealthy husband's family accompanied him to Mooers' studio once a month. They observed her behavior for signs of changes. The union between actress and mining [[kinship|scion]] became fractured and collapsed after the inquisitors decided Mooers had become less "lovely, charming, and conventional".

Mooers later wed actor [[Harry Lewis (actor)|Harry Lewis]]. She was a member of the Woman's Breakfast Club and director of the McKinley Home For Boys.

==Death==
In 1960 De Sacia Mooers died following a six week illness in [[Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center]]. She was seventy-two years old. Her residence was at 1523 North McCadden Place, Los Angeles.
