==Early years==

==Career==
Signed to [[Warner Bros.]] as an actor, Conrad took advantage of [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner's recording division]]. He eventually released several recordings issued on a variety of LPs, EPs, and SPs 33 and a third and 45 rpm records during the late 1950s and early 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nctc.net/hazard/conrad/shadoe|title=Shadoe Steele's Interview with Actor Robert Conrad|publisher=nctc.net|accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> He had a minor ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hit song in "Bye Bye Baby" which reached #113.<ref>Whitburn, Joel. ''Top Pop Singles'', 12th ed.</ref> In 1959, he played [[Billy the Kid]] in the episode "Amnesty" of ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Colt45.htm|title=''Colt .45''|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=December 22, 2012}}</ref>

Before ''The Wild Wild West'', Conrad played Tom Lopaka on the ABC/WB series ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'', opposite [[Anthony Eisley]] and [[Connie Stevens]]. The show was a hit and lasted from 1959 to 1963. The show was also a big hit overseas. In Mexico he signed a recording contract with the Orfeon label where he released two albums, a few singles sung in Spanish, and was introduced as Tom Lopaka himself. He played "Eric Dean" in the 1963 [[spring break]] film ''[[Palm Springs Weekend]]''. In 1965, Conrad garnered fame with the starring role in ''The Wild Wild West'' (airing on CBS for 4 seasons), which was a ratings success, consistently winning its time slot until its cancellation in 1969. After the cancellation of the series, Conrad starred in such roles as prosecuting attorney Paul Ryan in the short-lived 1971 [[NBC]] series, ''[[The D.A. (1971 TV series)|The D.A.]]'', and American spy Jake Webster in the series ''[[Assignment Vienna]]''. He starred in a third season episode of ''[[Mannix]]'' called "The Playground" and in an episode of ''[[Columbo]]'' ("[[List of Columbo episodes#Season 4|An Exercise in Fatality]]").<ref>[http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0072802 "An Exercise in Fatality"], imdb.com; accessed April 20, 2015.</ref> 

With his muscular build and cigarette-induced gravelly voice, Conrad found ratings success from 1976-78 playing legendary tough-guy [[World War II]] [[fighter ace]] [[Pappy Boyington]] in ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'', retitled for its second season and in later [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] as ''Black Sheep Squadron''. In 1978 he starred in the short lived TV series "The Duke" as boxer turned private eye Duke Ramsey. In 1980, he played a paraplegic coach in ''Coach of the Year'', which featured a then sixteen-year-old [[Richard Marx]] (credited as "Richard Marks"), as a high school football player.<ref>{{IMDb title|0080548|Coach of the Year}}</ref> In the late 1970s, he served as the captain of the [[NBC]] team for six editions of ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''. He played a modern-day variation of James West in the short-lived series ''[[A Man Called Sloane]]'' in 1979, which was around the same time that he reprised the role of West in a pair of made-for-TV films. He also starred in the 1978 TV miniseries ''[[Centennial (miniseries)|Centennial]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076993/fullcredits ''Centennial'' full credits"], imdb.com; accessed April 25, 2014.</ref> 

Conrad was widely identified in the late 1970s for his [[television commercial]]s for [[Energizer Holdings|Eveready]] batteries, particularly his placing of the battery on his shoulder and prompting the viewer to challenge its long-lasting power: "Come on, I dare ya". The commercial was frequently parodied on [[Johnny Carson]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]''. In 1986, he was a special guest referee for the main event at Wrestlemania II featuring [[Hulk Hogan]] vs [[King Kong Bundy]] inside a steel cage. 

In 1988, Conrad starred in a short-lived television series, ''[[High Mountain Rangers]]'', with two of his sons. ''High Mountain Rangers'', known for its spectacular scenery and stunts, had a one-season spinoff, ''Jesse Hawkes''. In 1990, Conrad starred in the [[TV movie|made-for-television]] adventure film ''[[Anything to Survive]]'' alongside [[Matt LeBlanc]] and [[Emily Perkins]]. In 1992, Conrad played the role of the sheriff in Richard Marx's "[[Hazard (song)|Hazard]]" [[music video]]. In 1996, he played the part of a police officer in the film ''Jingle all the Way''.  He took over hosting [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s ''Weapons At War'' (later ''Tech Force'') in 2000, succeeding [[George C. Scott]].

In 2006, Conrad recorded audio introductions for every episode of the first season of ''The Wild Wild West'' for its North American DVD release on June 6. The DVD set also included one of Conrad's Eveready battery commercials; in his introduction, Conrad stated he was flattered to be parodied by Carson. He was inducted into the Stuntman's Hall of Fame<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuntmen.org/members.html|title= Stuntmen's Hall of Fame (listed as Bob Conrad)|publisher=Stuntmen.org|accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> for his work on ''The Wild, Wild West'' series. He appeared in the documentary film, ''Pappy Boyington Field'', where he recounted his personal insights about the legendary Marine Corps Aviator that he portrayed in the television series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2008/01/ap_boyington_080122|title=After fight, airport named for legendary ace|publisher=Marinecorpstimes.com|accessdate=2011-06-27}}</ref> Conrad hosts a weekly radio talk show on CRN Digital Talk Radio.<ref name=CRN/>

==Personal life==
Conrad was married to Joan Kenlay from February 23, 1952 until their divorce in 1977; the couple had five children. His second marriage, to LaVelda Ione Fann, produced three children. After living in [[Bear_Valley_(resort)|Bear Valley]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|High Sierra]], Conrad and Fann relocated to [[Thousand Oaks, California]] in 2006. Conrad and Fann divorced in 2010.<ref>Robert Falk married Lovelda [sic] Ione Fann on March 28, 1983 in [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah, Nye County, Nevada]] on April 4, 1983.<br/>Book: I-8, Page: 1, Instrument number: 8345<br/>*Ancestry.com.

Conrad would be joined on some television shows by his sons, Shane and Christian, and his daughter, Nancy. Another daughter, Joan, became a [[television producer]]. In a 2008 interview, Conrad described the late Chicago Outfit "made man" and burglar, [[Michael Spilotro]], as his "best friend."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tonymedley.com/Articles/One_on_One_With_Robert_Conrad.htm|title=One on One with Robert Conrad|publisher=TonyMedley.com|date=1957-08-17|accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref> Spilotro's slaying was featured in the movie ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''.

Conrad was involved with a volunteer organization in Bear Valley known as Bear Valley Search and Rescue, which later formed the basis for ''[[High Mountain Rangers]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/19578544.html?dids=19578544:19578544&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+18%2C+1995&author=Harriet+Winslow&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Need+911%3F+Dial+C-o-n-r-a-d&pqatl=google|title=Need 911?

On March 31, 2003, while on [[California State Route 4|Highway 4]] in the California Sierra foothills near his [[Alpine County, California|Alpine County]] home, Conrad drove his [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] over the center median and slammed head-on into a [[Subaru]] being driven by 26-year-old Kevin Burnett. Both men suffered serious injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2003/11/20/PeopleInTheNews/Actor.Robert.Conrad.To.Be.Tried.On.Felony.Dui.Charges-563550.shtml|title=Actor Robert Conrad to be tried on felony DUI charges|accessdate=2008-12-03|date=2003-11-20}}</ref> Tried on felony charges, Conrad pleaded [[no contest]],<ref name="today sentenced">{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/6576577/ns/today-entertainment/t/robert-conrad-sentenced-dui-accident|title=Robert Conrad sentenced for DUI accident|work=MSNBC.com|author=Associated Press|date=November 24, 2004|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref> and he was convicted of drunk driving. (His blood-alcohol level had been 0.22 percent, nearly three times the legal limit.) He was sentenced to six months of house confinement, alcohol counseling, and five years probation.<ref name="today sentenced"/> 

A civil suit filed by Kevin Burnett against Conrad was settled the following year for an undisclosed amount. In 2005, Burnett died at age 28 from perforated ulcers, which his family attributed to his difficult recovery from the crash.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MS&p_theme=ms&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10C1AE5A40E9CF78&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Newsbank info re 2003 car crash|publisher=Nl.newsbank.com|date=2005-08-19|accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref><ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gjFZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ikcNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6969,1267594&dq=kevin+burnett+robert+conrad&hl=en "Man injured in Conrad accident dies from perforated ulcers at 28"]</ref> Conrad himself suffered severe nerve injuries from the crash, which left his right side partially paralyzed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/04/15/entertainment/main549493.shtml|title=Robert Conrad Takes Wrong Turn|publisher=CBSnews.com|date=2003-04-15|accessdate=2010-04-26}}</ref>

In February 2013, Conrad gave $500 to a British couple on vacation in Los Angeles after they were interviewed on [[KFI|KFI Radio]], recounting that their hotel was closed after a [[Cecil Hotel (Los Angeles)|corpse was found]] in the Cecil Hotel's water cistern.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-21725206 "Actor Robert Conrad 'helps Plymouth couple' after hotel body find"], BBC News, March 9, 2013</ref>
