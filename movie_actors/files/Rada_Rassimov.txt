'''Rada Rassimov''' (born '''Rada Đerasimović''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: Рада Ђерасимовић) in 1938, [[Trieste]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[actress]] of [[Serbs|Serb]] origin, who has appeared in film since the early 1960s and [[television]] since 1975.

Born to [[Serbia]]n parents, Velimir and Vera Đerasimović (née Petrijević), she attended, along with her two brothers, the Serbian Jovan Miletić Grammar School in Trieste where her father was the dean and teacher since 1927. Later, she went to university and took acting classes with her brother Ivan in Rome. Her career was at its peak in the 1960s and 1970s although she has appeared in film as recently as 2003. She is perhaps best known in world cinema for her appearance in [[Sergio Leone]]'s [[Spaghetti Western]] the ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' in 1966 in which she played the role of the [[prostitute]], Maria, beaten by [[Lee Van Cleef]].

Since 1975 she has worked predominantly on Italian television. She now lives in Paris.

Her brother [[Ivan Rassimov]], who died in a motorcycle accident in 2003, was also an actor. She has a younger brother, Milorad (born in 1945), now a retired music professor still living in Trieste.
