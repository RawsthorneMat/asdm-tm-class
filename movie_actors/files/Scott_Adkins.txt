==Early life==

Scott Adkins was born at Sutton Coldfield, England, on 17 June 1976.<ref>[http://www.scottadkins.com/biography.htm Scott Adkins] Biography on his [[Official Website]] (Accessed 9 January 2014)</ref> He became interested in martial arts at the age of 10 when he and his father and older brother, Craig visited the local Judo club. His interest towards martial arts grew even more at age 14 when he adopted [[Bruce Lee]] as his idol. That same year, he started practicing [[taekwondo]] and received his first black belt at the age 19. Since age 16, Adkins has also trained in [[kickboxing]] where he holds black belt in also. He also has background in
[[Ninjutsu]], [[Judo]], [[Karate]], [[Jujutsu]], [[Chinese martial arts|Wushu]], [[Krav Maga]], [[Capoeira]], [[Jeet Kune Do]] and [[Gymnastics]].

==Career==

His first break came when he was offered a role in a Hong Kong martial arts film called ''Dei Seung Chui Keung'' (2001) (aka Extreme Challenge). Spotted by Head of The Hong Kong Stuntmen Association and director Wei Tung and English-born Hong Kong movie expert Bey Logan, Adkins found himself in the East for the first time. Scott got the chance to work with some of Hong Kong cinema's leading action directors including Woo-ping Yuen, Corey Yuen, Sammo Hung Kam-Bo and the legendary Jackie Chan. Acting roles started to come in and he was offered a guest role in BBC's ''Doctors'' (2000) filmed at Birmingham's Pebble Mill. A few episodes in BBC's ''EastEnders'' (1985) and ''City Central'' (1998), and a lead role in Sky One comedy drama ''[[Mile High]]'' (2003) followed by a regular role in BBC's ''Holby City'' (1999) as Bradley Hume, the assistant general manager of Holby General.

Starring roles in feature films soon followed with his portrayal of Talbot in ''Special Forces'' (2003) and Yuri Boyka in ''Undisputed II: Last Man Standing'' (2006). It was this film that broke him into the mainstream with his villainous portrayal of a Russian MMA underground fighter Boyka. After this Scott had guest starring roles in bigger budget films like ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007) and ''[[The Tournament (film)|The Tournament]]'' (2009), and played [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]'s main adversary in Sony Pictures ''[[The Shepherd: Border Patrol]]'' (2008). Adkins appears in the role of King Amphitryon in ''[[The Legend of Hercules]]'' .<ref>[http://twitchfilm.com/2013/05/scott-adkins-crowned-king-in-renny-harlins-hercules-3d.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TwitchEverything+%28Twitch%29 Scott Adkins Crowned King In Renny Harlin's HERCULES 3D]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2014/more/news/scott-adkins-tony-jaa-kickboxer-1201276129/|title='Kickboxer' Reboot Punches Up Cast With Scott Adkins, Tony Jaa|work=Variety|date=5 August 2014|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>
