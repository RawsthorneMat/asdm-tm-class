'''Wesley Earl''' "'''Wes'''" '''Craven''' (born August 2, 1939) is an American film director, writer, producer, and actor known for his work on [[horror film]]s, particularly [[slasher film]]s. He is the creator of the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]] featuring the [[Freddy Krueger]] character, directed the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|first installment]] and ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare]]'', and also co-wrote ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'' with [[Bruce Wagner]]. Craven also directed the entire [[Scream (film series)|''Scream'' series]] featuring [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]]. Some of his other films include ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'', ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'', ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (film)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'', ''[[The People Under the Stairs]]'', ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]'', ''[[Cursed (2005 film)|Cursed]]'', ''[[Red Eye (2005 American film)|Red Eye]]'' and ''[[My Soul to Take]]''.

==Early life==
Craven was born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], the son of Caroline (née Miller) and Paul Craven.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/24/Wes-Craven.html Wes Craven Biography (1939–)] at filmreference.com</ref> He was raised in a strict Baptist family.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17talk-t.html The Horror of Being Wes Craven]</ref> Craven earned an undergraduate degree in [[English studies|English]] and [[Psychology]] from [[Wheaton College, Illinois|Wheaton College]] in [[Illinois]] and a master's degree in Philosophy and [[Johns Hopkins Writing Seminars|Writing]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>[[John Kenneth Muir|Muir, John Kenneth]] (1998). ''Wes Craven: The Art of Horror''. Jefferson, South Carolina: McFarland & Co. ISBN 0-7864-0576-7. pp. 8–9.</ref>

==Career before film industry==
Craven briefly taught [[English studies|English]] at [[Westminster College, Pennsylvania|Westminster College]] and was a [[humanities]] professor at Clarkson College of Technology (now [[Clarkson University]]) in Potsdam, New York. His first job in the [[film industry]] was as a [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] for a [[post-production]] company in New York City.

==Directing and writing career==
Craven left the academic world for the more lucrative role of pornographic film director. In the documentary ''[[Inside Deep Throat]]'', Craven says on camera he made "many hard core X-rated films" under pseudonyms. While his role in ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' is undisclosed, most of his early known work involved writing, film editing or both. In 1972 Wes Craven directed his first feature film ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]''.

Craven's works tend to share a common exploration of the nature of reality. ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', for example, dealt with the consequences of dreams in real life. ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]'' "brushes against" (but does not quite break) the [[fourth wall]] by having actress [[Heather Langenkamp]] play herself as she is haunted by the villain of the film in which she once starred. At one point in the film, we see on Wes Craven's word processor a script he has written, which includes the exact conversation he just had with Heather — as if the script was being written as the action unfolded. ''[[The Serpent and the Rainbow (film)|The Serpent and the Rainbow]]'' portrays a man who cannot distinguish between nightmarish visions and reality. In ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'', the characters frequently reference horror films similar to their situations, and at one point Billy Loomis tells his girlfriend that life is just a big movie.  This concept was emphasized in the sequels, as copycat stalkers reenact the events of a new film about the Woodsboro killings occurring in ''Scream''. ''Scream'' included a scene mentioning the well-known [[Richard Gere]] [[urban legend]].  Craven stated in interviews that he received calls from agents telling him that if he left that scene in, he would never work again.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20021003142223/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Boulevard/7811/screamreferences.html Movies Referenced in SCREAM]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289310,00.html|title=Slashed and Burned|first= Steve |last= Simels | work=Entertainment Weekly|date=September 5, 1997}}</ref> He directed ''[[Scream 4]]''.

Craven also frequently collaborates with [[Sean S. Cunningham]]. In Craven's debut feature, ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'', Cunningham served as producer. Later, in Craven's most famous film, ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', Cunningham directed one of the chase scenes, although uncredited. Their infamous characters, [[Freddy Krueger]] and [[Jason Voorhees]], appeared together in the 2003 slasher film ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' with Cunningham acting as producer, while screenwriter Victor Miller is credited as "Character Creator". Later, in [[The Last House on the Left (2009 film)|''The Last House on the Left'' remake]], both Cunningham and Craven share production credits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19559|title='Scream IV' Officially Greenlit with Wes Craven Attached}}</ref>

Although known for directing horror/thriller films, he has worked on two that were outside this genre: the 1999 film ''[[Music of the Heart]]'', and as one of the 22 directors in the 2006 collaboration ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]''.

Recently Craven has created ''Coming of Rage'', a graphic novel, with [[30 Days of Night|''30 Days of Night'' comic book]] writer [[Steve Niles]]. The comic will be released by Liquid Comics in 2013 with a possible film adaption directed by Craven and produced by ''[[Live Free Or Die Hard]]'' producer Arnold Rifkin and Liquid Comics CEO Sharad Devarajan.
