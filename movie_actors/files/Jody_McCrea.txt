'''Joel Dee McCrea''', known as '''Jody McCrea''' (September 6, 1934 – April 4, 2009),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/18/movies/18mccrea.html |title=Jody McCrea, Actor in 'Beach Party' Films, Dies at 74 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 17, 2009}}</ref> was an American film and television actor; son of veteran film actors [[Joel McCrea]] and [[Frances Dee]].  He was married to Dusty Ironwing McCrea from 1976, until her death in 1996. He is survived by the stepchildren he raised, Jaquet Ironwing and David Ironwing.

==Career==
Jody McCrea served in the [[United States Army]], [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]]. He later briefly hosted ''[[Country Style, USA]]'', an Army-produced recruiting television program filmed in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], featuring various country entertainers. He began acting on the 1959–1960 television series ''[[Wichita Town]]'' with his father. He went on to star in films (mainly westerns), including the [[World War I]] drama ''[[Lafayette Escadrille (film)|Lafayette Escadrille]]'', ''[[The Broken Land]]'' (with [[Jack Nicholson]]), ''Law of the Lawless'', and ''[[Cry Blood, Apache]]'', which he also produced.

In 1959, McCrea costarred with his father in the short-lived [[NBC]] western ''Wichita Town'', set in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Joel McCrea appeared as [[Marshal]] Mike Dunbar. Jody McCrea did not portray the role of Joel's son on the program but as the deputy marshal, Ben Matheson.

He was most notable for his comedic role as dumb-minded "Deadhead" ("Bonehead") in the 1960s ''[[Beach Party]]'' films made by [[American International Pictures]]. Other beach movies in which he has appeared include ''[[Muscle Beach Party]]'', ''[[Bikini Beach]]'', and ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]''.

He made several television appearances, including ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''Vacation Playhouse'', and ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]''. He played Lieutenant Brannin, a cocky [[cavalry]] officer based loosely on [[George Armstrong Custer]], in [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Major Dundee]]'' (1965), but his scene was deleted from the final cut.

In the early 1960s, Jody made an amusing appearance on the popular TV show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' as part of a group of entertainers related to famous Hollywood personalities.

When cast in the beach pictures, McCrea realized his comedic potential. When first offered the role of "Deadhead", for example, he was quoted at the time as saying that he "wasn't sure what the character would become". McCrea felt that the audience enjoyed Deadhead as they felt superior to him.<ref name="cinemaretro.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/3160-THE-TIDE-GOES-OUT-FOR-BEACH-PARTY-CO-STAR-JODY-MCCREA-A-TRIBUTE-BY-TOM-LISANTI.html |title=The Tide Goes Out for 'Beach Party' |work=[[Cinema Retro]] |accessdate=May 2, 2012}}</ref>

McCrea was an avid body builder, and the only actor appearing in the [[American International Pictures]] beach movies who could actually surf.

He recorded a 45 rpm single in 1964 for Canjo Records to coincide with the film ''[[Bikini Beach]]'' (Side A: "Chicken Surfer"/Side B: "Looney Gooney Bird")

==Later career and death==
Although he occasionally acted in community theater, McCrea retired from acting in 1970 after his final film ''Cry Blood, Apache''.  He became a rancher in [[Roswell, New Mexico]], where he died in 2009 of a heart attack at age 74.
