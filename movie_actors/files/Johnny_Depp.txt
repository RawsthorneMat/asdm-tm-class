Depp stated in a [[BBC radio]] interview on July 29, 2013 that he hopes to be involved with "quieter things" at some point in the near future, implying that he will retire from acting. Depp explained in further detail during the interview: "I wouldn't say I'm dropping out any second, but I would say it's probably not too far away. When you add up the amount of dialogue that you say per year and you realise that you've said written words more than you've had a chance to say your own words, you start thinking about that as an insane option for a human being."<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnny Depp says he may retire from acting soon|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/29/johnny-depp-retire-acting-soon|accessdate=July 30, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=July 29, 2013|author=Henry Barnes}}</ref>

====Collaborations with Tim Burton====
Depp has collaborated with director and close friend [[Tim Burton]] in films, beginning with ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), opposite [[Winona Ryder]] and [[Vincent Price]]. His next role with Burton was in the 1994 film ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''.<ref name=tca/> Depp later said that "within 10 minutes of hearing about the project, I was committed."<ref name="Arnold, Gary">{{cite news |last=Arnold |first=Gary |title=Depp sees promise in cult filmmaker Ed Wood's story |work=The Washington Times |date=October 2, 1994}}</ref> At the time, the actor was depressed about films and filmmaking. This part gave him a "chance to stretch out and have some fun"; he said working with Martin Landau "rejuvenated my love for acting".<ref name="Arnold, Gary" />
Producer [[Scott Rudin]] once said "Basically Johnny Depp is playing Tim Burton in all his movies,"{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|pp=177–178}} although Burton personally disapproved of the comment. Depp, however, agrees with Rudin's statement. According to Depp, ''Edward Scissorhands'' represented Burton's inability to communicate as a teenager. ''Ed Wood'' reflected Burton's relationship with [[Vincent Price]] (very similar to [[Ed Wood|Edward D. Wood, Jr.]] and [[Bela Lugosi]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Burton interviewed by Gavin Smith|url=http://minadream.com/timburton/EdWoodInterview.htm|publisher=minadream.com|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Johnny Depp Walk of Fame.jpg|left|thumb|Depp's [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star received on November 19, 1999]]

Depp's next venture with Burton was the role of [[Ichabod Crane]] in ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1999), opposite [[Christina Ricci]]. ''Sleepy Hollow'' reflected Burton's battle with the Hollywood studio system.{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|p=179}} For his performance, Depp took inspiration from [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Roddy McDowall]] and [[Basil Rathbone]].{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|pp=177–178}} Depp stated, "I always thought of Ichabod as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl."<ref>{{cite news |title=Johnny Depp on playing Ichabod Crane in ''Sleepy Hollow'' |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=May 2007 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20039648,00.html#20056052|accessdate=December 25, 2007}}</ref>

Depp did not work with Burton again until 2005 in ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', in which he played [[Willy Wonka]]. The film was a box office success and received positive critical reception.<ref>{{cite web |title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/charlie_and_the_chocolate_factory/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=May 17, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Charlie and the Chocolate Factory | url = http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/charlieandthechocolatefactory |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=May 17, 2008}}</ref> [[Gene Wilder]], who played Willy Wonka in the [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory|1971 film]], initially criticized this version.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2005/06/johnny_depp_vs_.html |title=Charlie's Chocolate Wars: Sweet tooth for cash? |work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=May 17, 2008}}</ref> ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was released in July, followed by ''[[Corpse Bride]]'', for which Depp voiced the character Victor Van Dort, in September.<ref>{{cite web|last=Papamichael|first=Stella|title=Corpse Bride (2005)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2005/10/10/corpse_bride_2005_review.shtml|publisher=BBC|date=October 21, 2005|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref>

''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' (2007) followed, bringing Depp his second major award win, the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&nbsp;– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] as well as his third nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. Burton first gave him an original cast recording of the [[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)|1979 stage musical]] in 2000. Although not a fan of the musical genre, Depp grew to like the tale's treatment. He cited [[Peter Lorre]] in ''[[Mad Love (1935 film)|Mad Love]]'' (1935) as his main influence for the role, and practiced the songs his character would perform while filming ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''.<ref name="cuttingloose">{{cite news |author=Daly, Steve | title = Johnny Depp: Cutting Loose in ''Sweeney Todd'' |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = October 31, 2007 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20155516_20155530_20156283,00.html |accessdate=November 6, 2007}}</ref> Although he had performed in musical groups, Depp was initially unsure that he would be able to sustain [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s lyrics. Depp recorded [[demo (music)|demos]] and worked with Bruce Witkin to shape his vocals without a qualified voice coach. In the ''DVD Reviews'' section, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s Chris Nashawaty gave the film an A minus, stating, "Depp's soaring voice makes you wonder what other tricks he's been hiding&nbsp;... Watching Depp's barber wield his razors&nbsp;... it's hard not to be reminded of ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' frantically shaping hedges into animal topiaries 18 years ago&nbsp;... and all of the twisted beauty we would've missed out on had [Burton and Depp] never met."<ref>{{cite news |last=Nashawaty |first=Chris |title=Johnny Depp and Tim Burton: A DVD Report Card |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=April 4, 2008 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20186999_6,00.html |accessdate =July 8, 2008}}</ref>
In his introduction to ''Burton on Burton'', a book of interviews with the director, Depp called Burton "...&nbsp;a brother, a friend,&nbsp;... and [a] brave soul".{{sfn|Burton|Salisbury|2006|p=}} The next Depp-Burton collaboration was ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (2010). Depp played the [[Mad Hatter]] alongside [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Anne Hathaway]] and [[Alan Rickman]]. In 2012, he starred in the Burton-directed ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'', a film based on the 1966–1971 gothic soap opera [[Dark Shadows|of the same name]], alongside fellow Tim Burton regular [[Helena Bonham Carter]], as well as [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] and [[Eva Green]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnny Depp Stars in Tim Burton's 'Dark Shadows'|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/movies/johnny-depp-stars-in-tim-burtons-dark-shadows.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|accessdate=August 13, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 10, 2012|first=Manohla|last=Dargis}}</ref>

===Ancestry===
Depp is mostly of [[English-American|English]] ancestry, with smaller amounts from elsewhere in Europe. He is descended from a French [[Huguenot]] immigrant, Pierre Deppe or Dieppe, who settled in [[Virginia]] around 1700,<ref name="Meilke2004">

===Claims of Native American ancestry and Comanche adoption===
In interviews in 2002 and 2011, Depp stated that he "guesses" he has [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&feature=endscreen&v=XgvgO5f0nSw|title=Inside The Actors Studio&nbsp;– Johnny Depp|publisher= YouTube|accessdate=October 6, 2012}} {{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref><ref name="EW">{{cite web|last=Breznican |first=Anthony |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/05/08/johnny-depp-tonto-lone-ranger/ |title=Johnny Depp on 'The Lone Ranger'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 8, 2011 |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}</ref> and that his "great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American, she grew up [[Cherokee]] or maybe [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek Indian]]."<ref name="EW" /> However, he has cited family stories and Kentucky lore among non-Natives, rather than any evidence, for this belief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/entertainment/Johnny+Depp+Tonto+leader+Lone+Ranger+follower/8576134/story.html |title=Johnny Deppâ€™s Tonto a leader not a Lone Ranger follower |publisher=Canada.com |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref> Depp's claims came under question when [[Indian Country Today Media Network]] stated that Depp has never inquired about his heritage nor does the [[Cherokee Nation]] recognize him as a member.<ref name=exploiting>{{cite web|title=Disney Exploiting Confusion About Whether Depp Has Indian Blood|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/06/17/disney-exploiting-confusion-about-whether-depp-has-indian-blood-149941|date=June 17, 2013|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref> Depp's continued claims, despite all evidence indicating he has no Native American ancestry, have led to criticism from the Native community, as well as criticism of his choice to portray a Native American character (Tonto).<ref name=exploiting /><ref name="ICTnuts">{{cite web|title=Is 'Tonto's Giant Nuts' a Good Name for Johnny Depp's Band?|work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|date=May 22, 2013|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/05/22/tontos-giant-nuts-good-name-johnny-depps-band-149470}}</ref><ref name="ICTybarra">{{cite web|last=ICTMN Staff |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/06/12/video-tito-ybarra-greets-indian-country-phat-johnny-depp-149865 |title=Tito Ybarra Greets Indian Country as 'Phat Johnny Depp' |work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]] |date=June 12, 2013 |accessdate=February 4, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Keene1">{{cite web|last=Keene |first=Adrienne |url=http://nativeappropriations.com/2012/12/native-video-round-up-johnny-depp-identity-and-poetry.html |title=Native Video Round-Up: Johnny Depp, Identity, and Poetry |work=Native Appropriations |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=February 4, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Bogado1">{{cite web|last=Bogado |first=Aura |url=http://colorlines.com/archives/2013/11/five_things_to_celebrate_about_indian_country.html |title=Five Things to Celebrate About Indian Country (Humor) |work=[[Colorlines]] |date=November 25, 2013 |accessdate=February 4, 2014}}</ref>

===Comments on U.S.===
In 2003, Depp told Germany's [[Stern (magazine)|''Stern'']] magazine, "America is dumb, is something like a dumb puppy that has big teeth—that can bite and hurt you, aggressive."<ref name="Hindu" /> Although he later asserted that the magazine misquoted him and the quotation was taken out of context, ''Stern'' stood by its story, as did [[CNN]].com in its coverage of the interview. CNN added his remark that he would like his children "to see America as a toy, a broken toy. Investigate it a little, check it out, get this feeling and then get out."<ref name="Silverman2003-09-03">

In 2011, Depp became a U.S. resident again, because France wanted him to become a permanent resident, which he said would require him to pay income tax in both countries.<ref>[http://blog.chron.com/celebritybuzz/2011/11/johnny-depp-moves-back-to-america-to-avoid-paying-taxes-in-france/ Johnny Depp moves back to America to avoid paying taxes in France], [[Houston Chronicle]], November 11, 2011</ref>

===Alleged dog smuggling===
In May 2015, Depp was accused of illegally bringing his [[Yorkshire Terrier]]s Boo and Pistol into Australia. The breach of Australian [[quarantine]] regulations appeared to have become apparent after a dog grooming salon posted pictures of the dogs on its [[Facebook]] page. Shortly afterwards, Agriculture Minister [[Barnaby Joyce]] said: "If we start letting movie stars even though they've been the 'sexiest man alive' twice to come into our nation, then why don't we just break the laws for everybody? It's time that Pistol and Boo buggered off back to the United States."<ref name="BBC News 14 May 2015">{{cite web | title= Johnny Depp's dogs face death in Australia |url=  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-32732313| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 14 May 2015 | website= BBC News | accessdate= 26 May 2015}}</ref> The [[BBC]] later reported, "Biosecurity officials visited the vast Gold Coast house Depp and [Amber] Heard are renting on Wednesday”, quoting an agricultural ministry website which said: "The dogs have been ordered into quarantine and the owners have been advised the dogs must be exported within 72 hours".<ref name="BBC News 14 May 2015">{{cite web | title= Johnny Depp's dogs face death in Australia |url=  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-32732313| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 14 May 2015 | website= BBC News | accessdate= 26 May 2015}}</ref>
