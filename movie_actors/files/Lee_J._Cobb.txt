'''Lee J. Cobb''' (December 8, 1911{{spaced ndash}}February 11, 1976) was an [[United States|American]] actor.<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', February 18, 1976.</ref> He is best known for his performance in ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' ([[1957 in film|1957]]), his [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Award]]-nominated performance in ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' ([[1954 in film|1954]]), and one of his last films, ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' ([[1973 in film|1973]]). He also played the role of [[Willy Loman]] in the original Broadway production of [[Arthur Miller]]'s 1949 play ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' under the direction of [[Elia Kazan]]. On television, Cobb costarred in the first four seasons of the popular, long-running western series ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''. He typically played arrogant, intimidating, and abrasive characters, but often had roles as respectable figures such as judges and police officers.

== Background ==
Born '''Leo Jacob''' in [[New York City]], to a [[Jew]]ish family of [[Russia]]n and [[Romania]]n extraction.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RMUdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YlYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6763,1901672&dq |title=Bicentennial a 'very special event" for actor Lee J.

Cobb Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=May 10, 2010}}</ref>

== Career ==
Cobb performed [[Summer stock theatre|summer stock]] at [[Pine Brook Country Club]] located in the countryside of [[Nichols, Connecticut]], in the 1930s and early 1940s. Pine Brook was the summer home of the [[Group Theatre (New York)]] from 1931 until the 1940s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinewoodlake.org/ |title=Pinewood Lake website retrieved on 2010-09-10 |publisher=Pinewoodlake.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref> During World War II Cobb served in the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] of the [[United States Army Air Forces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/World-War-II-The-Movie.html?c=y&page=2 |title=World War II: The Movie &#124; History of Flight &#124; Air & Space Magazine |publisher=Airspacemag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>

Cobb entered films in the 1930s, successfully playing middle-aged and even older men while he was still a youth. He was cast as the Kralahome in the 1946 non-musical film ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (film)|Anna and the King of Siam]]''. He also played the sympathetic doctor in ''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]'' and appeared as [[James Coburn]]'s supervisor in the spy spoofs ''[[In Like Flint]]'' and ''[[Our Man Flint]]''. He reprised his role of Willy Loman in the 1966 [[CBS]] [[television]] adaptation of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', which included [[Gene Wilder]], [[James Farentino]], [[Bernie Kopell]] and [[George Segal]]. Cobb was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for the performance. [[Mildred Dunnock]], who had co-starred in both the original stage version and the 1951 film version, again repeated her role as Linda, Willy's devoted wife.

In 1957 he appeared in [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' as the abrasive Juror #3.  In 1959, on CBS' ''[[DuPont Show of the Month]]'', he starred in the dual roles of [[Miguel de Cervantes]] and [[Don Quixote]] in the play ''[[I, Don Quixote]]'', which years later became the musical ''[[Man of La Mancha]]''. Cobb also appeared as [[Wyoming]] [[ranch]] owner Judge Henry Garth in the first four seasons of the long-running [[NBC]] [[western (genre)|western]] [[television series]] ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''. His co-stars were [[James Drury]], [[Doug McClure]], [[Roberta Shore]], [[Gary Clarke]], [[Randy Boone]], [[Clu Gulager]] and [[Diane Roter]].

In 1968 his performance as [[King Lear]] with [[Stacy Keach]] as Edmund, [[René Auberjonois (actor)|René Auberjonois]] as the Fool and [[Philip Bosco]] as Kent achieved the longest run (72 performances) for the play in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] history.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3432 |title=King Lear &#124; IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information |publisher=IBDB |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref>

One of his final film roles was that of police [[detective]] Lt. Kinderman in the 1973 horror film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.

== Political activity ==

Cobb was accused of being a [[Communist]] in 1951 testimony before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] by [[Larry Parks]], himself a former Communist Party member. Cobb was called to testify before HUAC but refused to do so for two years until, with his career threatened by the [[blacklist]], he relented in 1953 and gave testimony in which he named 20 people as former members of the [[Communist Party USA]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Navasky|first=Victor|authorlink=Victor Navasky|title=Naming Names|edition=Reprint|year=2003|publisher=Hill & Wang|isbn=978-0809001835}}</ref>

Later, Cobb explained why he "named names", saying:

<blockquote>When the facilities of the government of the United States are drawn on an individual it can be terrifying. The blacklist is just the opening gambit—being deprived of work. Your passport is confiscated. That's minor. But not being able to move without being tailed is something else. After a certain point it grows to implied as well as articulated threats, and people succumb. My wife did, and she was institutionalized. The HUAC did a deal with me. I was pretty much worn down. I had no money. I couldn't borrow. I had the expenses of taking care of the children. Why am I subjecting my loved ones to this? If it's worth dying for, and I am just as idealistic as the next fellow. But I decided it wasn't worth dying for, and if this gesture was the way of getting out of the penitentiary I'd do it. I had to be employable again.

:— Interview with [[Victor Navasky]] for the 1980 book ''Naming Names''
</blockquote>

Following the hearing he resumed his career and worked with [[Elia Kazan]] and [[Budd Schulberg]], two other HUAC "friendly witnesses", on the 1954 film ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', which is widely seen as an allegory and apologia for testifying.

== Death ==

Cobb died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in February 1976 in [[Woodland Hills, California]], and was buried in [[Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Los Angeles. He was survived by his second wife, Mary Hirsch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=35965&apid=96791|publisher=tcm.com|title=Biography for Lee J. Cobb|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> His death came the day before his ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'' (1960) co-star [[Sal Mineo]] was murdered.

He was inducted, posthumously, into the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/03/theater/26-elected-theater-hall-fame-26-broadway-voted-into-theater-hall-fame.html |title='&#39;The New York Times'&#39;, March 3, 1981 - '&#39;26 Elected to the Theater Hall of Fame'&#39; |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1981-03-03 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>
