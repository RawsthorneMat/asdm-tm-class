'''Peter Paul Fix''' (March 13, 1901 – October 14, 1983) was an American film and television [[character actor]], best known for his work in [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. Fix appeared in more than a hundred movies and dozens of television shows over a 56-year career spanning from 1925 to 1981. In the 1950s, Fix was best known for portraying Marshal Micah Torrance alongside [[Chuck Connors]] and [[Johnny Crawford]] in ''[[The Rifleman]]''. Fix later appeared with Chuck Connors in the 1966 western film ''Ride Beyond Vengeance''.

==Career==
Fix was born in [[Dobbs Ferry, New York|Dobbs Ferry]], [[New York (U.S. state)|New York]], to brewmaster Wilhelm Fix and his wife, the former Louise C. Walz. His mother and father were German immigrants who had left their Black Forest home and arrived in New York City in the 1870s. (The name "Fix" is of [[Latin language|Latin]]/[[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin, and is derived from St. Vitus and means "animated" or "vital").{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A veteran of the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]], Fix became an incredibly busy character actor who obtained his start in local productions in New York. By the 1920s, he had moved to Hollywood, and performed in the first of almost 350 movie and television appearances. In the 1930s, he became friends with [[John Wayne]]. He was Wayne's acting coach and eventually appeared as a featured player in about 27 of Wayne's films.

Fix worked in early films such as ''[[Lucky Star (1929 film)|Lucky Star]]'' (1929) and ''[[Ladies Love Brutes]]'' (1930), and became a regular performer for the film's director, [[Frank Borzage]], on a further eight occasions. Fix later appeared as Richard Bravo in the 1950s cult classic, ''[[The Bad Seed (1956 film)|The Bad Seed]]'' (1956), ''The Sea Chase'' (1955) playing Heinz the cook, and in [[George Stevens]]' ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), playing [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s father.

Though Fix is best-remembered for his recurring role as Marshal Micah Torrance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''The Rifleman'', he also worked in many other series in guest-starring roles. On February 28, 1958, he appeared with [[Edd Byrnes]] as Frank Wilson, Sr., and Frank, Jr., respectively in the episode "The Golden Gun" on the ABC/[[Warner Brothers]], western series, ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]'', starring [[Wayde Preston]]. [[Ron Hayes]], [[Charles Fredericks (actor)|Charles Fredericks]], and [[Stuart Randall (actor)|Stuart Randall]] also appeared in this episode. Seven months later, Byrnes was cast in the new ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]'' ABC/WB production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Colt45.htm|title=Colt .45|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=December 22, 2012}}</ref>

On December 25, 1958, Fix appeared in the episode "Medal for Valor" on [[CBS]]'s ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater]]''. Fix plays Rufus Stewart, a businessman who hires David Manning, played by [[Richard Basehart]], a man with an ill wife who is in need of medical treatment, to substitute in the [[American Civil War]] for Stewart's son, Adam', portrayed by [[Richard Anderson]]. Manning, who won a [[Medal of Honor]], returns from three years in the [[United States Army]] with an affidavit certifying that he was a military substitute so that he can claim western land. Rufus Stewart reneges on the promise because the son, the local sheriff, is running for the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Oddly, Rufus winds up being shot to death in a confrontation that he caused, and Adam agrees to provide the affidavit to Manning. The episode does not reveal if the sheriff was elected to Congress but considers the political liability of one having hired a substitute in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0754262/|title=''Zane Grey Theatre'': "Medal for Valor", December 25, 1958|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}</ref>

Fix guest starred on the short-lived detective series, ''[[Meet McGraw]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Crime/MeetMcGraw.htm|title=Meet McGraw|publisher=Classic TV Archives|accessdate=September 9, 2009}}</ref> and on the western series of [[Rory Calhoun]] and [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]], ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'' and ''[[The Restless Gun]]'', which aired, respectively, in the same time slot on Mondays on CBS and [[NBC]].

Fix played the historical role of [[U.S. President]] [[Zachary Taylor]] in the 1960 episode "That Taylor Affair" of the NBC western series, ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', with [[Darren McGavin]]. [[Arlene Dahl]] was cast in this episode as Lucy Belle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0687103/|title="That Taylor Affair", ''Riverboat'', September 26, 1960|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref>

In 1961, Fix appeared as Ramsey Collins in the series finale, "Around the Dark Corner", of the NBC [[crime drama]] ''[[Dante (TV series)|Dante]]''. That same year he played Dr. Abel in the episode "The Haven" on ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]''. Other television credits included ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'' (1953–1954, with [[Anthony Caruso (actor)|Anthony Caruso]] and [[Elisha Cook, Jr.]]) and the adventure series, ''[[Northwest Passage (TV series)|Northwest Passage]]''.

Fix played Dr. Mark Piper, [[Leonard McCoy]]'s predecessor in the second pilot episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', "[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]". When NBC picked up ''Star Trek'' as a series in 1966, Fix was replaced as the ''Enterprise'' medical officer by [[DeForest Kelley]] in the role of Dr. Leonard "Bones" McCoy.

Fix appeared as the presiding judge in ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1962). He played the sheriff in ''[[The Sons of Katie Elder]]''. In 1966, he appeared in the film ''[[El Dorado (1966 film)|El Dorado]]''. In 1972 he appeared in the film ''[[Night of the Lepus]]''. In 1979, he appeared in ''[[Wanda Nevada]]''. Fix co-wrote the screenplay for the [[John Wayne]] film ''[[Tall in the Saddle]]''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037343/fullcredits#cast Tall in the Saddle cast & crew details,imdb]</ref>

Fix made five appearances as District Attorney Hale on ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' (1957–1963), showing great skill as an examiner who did not ask objectionable questions unlike [[Hamilton Burger]], who often experienced a judge's ire for asking leading questions. He guest starred on such television series as ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' (1964), ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'' (1965–1973), ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'' (1966), ''[[The Time Tunnel]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (1966–1967), ''[[Daniel Boone (TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' (1969), ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'' (1971), ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' episode "The House on Willis Avenue" (as Joe Tooley), and two episodes of ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', one in 1973 and again in 1975, each a different character/storyline. He appeared on the NBC series ''[[Kentucky Jones]]'' (1964) as Judge Perkins in the episode "Spare the Rod". He played an aging suicidal novelist named Maxwell Hart on the ''[[Emergency!]]'' episode "Kidding", where Paramedic John Gage (played by Randolph Mantooth) was in charge of a small group of intellectual 10- and 11-year-old school children on a tour of Rampart General Hospital. He played the role of [[New Mexico]] rancher Pete Maxwell in the 1973 film ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]''. In 1974, he made an appearance as an old friend of Steve Austin's in the TV series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' in the episode "Population Zero". He also appeared as Kronus, a retired fleet commander on the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.

==Personal life and death==
His daughter, Marilyn, married actor [[Harry Carey, Jr.]], in 1944 and had four children of their own.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Fix died of [[renal failure]] in Los Angeles, at the age of eighty-two.
