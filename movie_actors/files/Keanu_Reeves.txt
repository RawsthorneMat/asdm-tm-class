'''Keanu Charles Reeves''' ({{IPAc-en|k|eɪ|ˈ|ɑː|n|uː}} {{respell|kay|AH|noo}}; born September 2, 1964)<ref>{{cite news|title=Monitor|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 6, 2013|issue=1275|page=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Keanu Reeves biography|url=http://www.keanu.org/biography.html|publisher=Biography.com}}</ref> is a Canadian actor, director, producer, musician, and author.

Reeves is most well known for his acting career, beginning in 1985 and spanning for more than three decades. He gained fame for his starring role performances in several blockbuster films including comedies from the ''[[Bill & Ted (franchise)|Bill and Ted franchise]]'' (1989-1991), action thrillers ''[[Point Break]]'' (1991) and ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' (1994), and the science fiction-action trilogy ''[[The Matrix (franchise)#Films|The Matrix]]'' (1999-2003). He has also appeared in several dramatic films such as ''[[Dangerous Liaisons]]'' (1988), ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991), and ''[[Little Buddha]]'' (1993).

Since becoming active in the film industry, Reeves' abilities have earned critical acclaim. One ''New York Times'' critic praised Reeves' versatility, saying that he "displays considerable discipline and range. He moves easily between the buttoned-down demeanor that suits a [[police procedural]] story and the loose-jointed manner of his comic roles."<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE3D9143EF931A25754C0A967958260</ref> Even with an amplitude of skills, Reeves has spent much of his later career being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]]. A recurring [[character arc]] in many roles he has portrayed is one of [[salvation|saving the world]], as can be seen in the characters of [[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure|Ted Logan]], [[Buddha]], [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]], [[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]], [[John Constantine#Film|John Constantine]] and [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]]. His acting has garnered several awards including a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

During his film career, Reeves has engaged in several forms of artistic expression. He played bass guitar in the bands [[Dogstar (band)|Dogstar]] and Becky. Acting onstage, he performed as [[Prince Hamlet]] for the [[Manitoba Theatre Centre]]'s production of ''[[Hamlet]]''. He wrote the text for a picture book, ''Ode to Happiness'', illustrated by [[Alexandra Grant]]. He has also produced a documentary, ''[[Side by Side (2012 film)|Side by Side]]'', and directed the martial arts film ''[[Man of Tai Chi]]''.

==Career==

===1980s: Early career===
Reeves began his acting career at the age of nine, appearing in a theatre production of ''[[Damn Yankees]]''. At 15, he played [[Mercutio]] in a stage production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' at the Leah Posluns Theatre. Reeves dropped out of high school when he was 17. He obtained a green card through his American stepfather and moved to [[Los Angeles]] three years later.<ref name="dailymail2008"/><ref name="totalfilm2008"/> He lived with his ex-stepfather, Paul Aaron, who was a stage and television director.<ref name="dailymail2008"/> Reeves made his screen acting debut in an episode of ''[[Hangin' In]]''. In the early 1980s, he appeared in commercials (including one for [[Coca-Cola]]), short films including the NFB drama ''One Step Away''<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 10, 2008|url=http://www.nfb.ca/trouverunfilm/fichefilm.php?id=16124&v=h&lg=en&exp=|title=One Step Away|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]}}</ref> and stage work such as [[Brad Fraser]]'s cult hit ''[[Wolfboy]]'' in Toronto. In 1984, he was a correspondent for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] TV youth program ''[[Going Great]]''.<ref name="YouTube">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io0BqClHuPE YouTube clip], CBC RetroBites: Keanu Reeves. Retrieved October 22, 2014.</ref>

His first studio movie appearance was ''[[Youngblood (1986 film)|Youngblood]]'' (1986) in which he played a [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] goalie. Shortly after the movie's release, Reeves drove to Los Angeles in his 1969 [[Volvo]]. His stepfather had convinced [[Erwin Stoff]] in advance to be Reeves's manager and agent. Stoff has remained Reeves's manager, and has co-produced many of his films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Actors/Reeves,_Keanu/Biography/|title=Keanu Reeves|work=Starpulse}}</ref>

After a few minor roles, Reeves received a sizable role in the 1986 drama film ''[[River's Edge]]'', which depicted how a murder affected a group of teens. Following this film's critical success, he spent the late 1980s appearing in a number of movies aimed at teenage audiences, including ''[[Permanent Record (film)|Permanent Record]]'', and the unexpectedly successful 1989 comedy, ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', along with its 1991 sequel, ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]''.

===1990s: Widespread popularity===
From 1991, Reeves played bass guitar in the [[grunge rock|grunge]] band [[Dogstar (band)|Dogstar]]. During the early 1990s, Reeves started to break out of his teen-film period. He appeared in high-budget action films like ''[[Point Break]],'' for which he won MTV's "Most Desirable Male" award in 1992. He was involved in various lower-budget [[independent film]]s, including the well-received 1991 film, ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' with [[River Phoenix]]. In 1992, he played [[Jonathan Harker]] in the [[Francis Ford Coppola]]-directed blockbuster ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'', but his performance was [[Bram Stoker's Dracula#Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker|received negatively]].

In 1994, Reeves's career reached a new high as a result of his starring role in the action film ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]].'' His casting in the film was controversial since, except for ''Point Break'', he was primarily known for comedies and indie dramas. He had never been the sole headliner on a film. The summer action film had a fairly large budget and was helmed by novice cinematographer-turned-director [[Jan de Bont]].

Reeves's career choices after ''Speed'' were eclectic: despite his successes, Reeves continued to accept supporting roles and appear in experimental films. He scored a hit with a romantic lead role in ''[[A Walk in the Clouds]]''. He made news by refusing to take part in ''[[Speed 2: Cruise Control]]'' – despite the offered $11 million paycheck, which would have been his largest to date – in favour of touring with his band and playing the [[Prince Hamlet|title role]] in a 1995 [[Manitoba Theatre Centre]] production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtc.mb.ca/news.aspx?id=1356|title=Manitoba Theatre Centre: News|publisher=Mtc.mb.ca |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> Of his performance, [[Roger Lewis]], the ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' theatre critic, wrote, "He quite embodied the innocence, the splendid fury, the animal grace of the leaps and bounds, the emotional violence, that form the Prince of Denmark ... He is one of the top three Hamlets I have seen, for a simple reason: he ''is'' Hamlet."<ref>''Vanity Fair'' Volume 58, 1995.</ref>

However, Reeves's choices after ''A Walk in the Clouds'' failed with critics and audiences. Big-budget films such as the sci-fi action film ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' and the action-thriller ''[[Chain Reaction (film)|Chain Reaction]]'' were critically panned and failed at the box office, while indie films like ''[[Feeling Minnesota]]'' were also critical failures. Reeves finally started to climb out of his career low after starring in the horror-drama ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'' alongside [[Al Pacino]] and [[Charlize Theron]]. Reeves took a paycut of $1 million for ''The Devil's Advocate'' so that Pacino would be cast, and later took a 90 per cent paycut for the less successful ''[[The Replacements (film)|The Replacements]]'' to guarantee the casting of [[Gene Hackman]].<ref name="meta">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=102572&page=1|title=Keanu Gives Up 'Matrix' Money|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=June 29, 2012}}</ref> ''The Devil's Advocate'' did well at the box office and garnered good reviews.

The 1999 science fiction-action hit ''[[The Matrix]]'', a film in which Reeves had a starring role, was a box office success and attracted positive reviews.<ref name="meta">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/matrix|title=The Matrix (1999): Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Keanu Reeves Star.jpg|thumb|left|Reeves' star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame]]

===2000s: Continued successes===
In between the first ''Matrix'' film and its sequels, Reeves received positive reviews for his portrayal of an [[domestic violence|abusive]] husband in ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]''. Aside from ''The Gift'', Reeves appeared in several films that received mostly negative reviews and unimpressive box office grosses, including ''[[The Watcher (film)|The Watcher]]'', ''[[Sweet November (2001 film)|Sweet November]]'', and ''[[The Replacements (film)|The Replacements]]''. However, the two ''Matrix'' sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', along with ''[[Something's Gotta Give (film)|Something's Gotta Give]]'' and the 2005 horror-action film, ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'', were box office successes and brought Reeves back into the public spotlight. Reeves performed with the band [[Becky (band)|Becky]] for a year, but quit in 2005, citing his lack of interest in a serious music career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/keanu-quits-becky|title=Keanu Quits Becky|publisher=Contactmusic.com|date=February 1, 2005|accessdate=May 23, 2013}}</ref>

In early 2005, Reeves' accomplishments in Hollywood were recognized by the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/keanu-reeves|title=Keanu Reeves - Hollywood Walk of Fame|work=walkoffame.com}}</ref> He was ceremoniously inducted at 6801 Hollywood Blvd, the location of his star. With the honorable acknowledgement of a Hollywood star, Reeves continued acting.

His appearance in ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (2006), based on the dystopian science fiction novel by [[Philip K. Dick]], received favorable reviews, and ''[[The Lake House (film)|The Lake House]]'', his romantic outing with Sandra Bullock, was a success at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lakehouse.htm|title=The Lake House |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}</ref> He went on to play the lead character in two 2008 films, ''[[Street Kings (film)|Street Kings]]'' and ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]''. In February 2009 ''[[The Private Lives of Pippa Lee|The Private Life of Pippa Lee]]'' was presented at [[Berlinale]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Private Lives Of Pippa Lee|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2009/02_programm_2009/02_Filmdatenblatt_2009_20090100.php|work=Film file|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref>

===2010s: New artistic roles===
Beginning in 2008, Reeves began pre-production on his directorial debut, ''[[Man of Tai Chi]]''. The film is a multilingual narrative, partly inspired by the life of his friend, stuntman [[Tiger Chen]]. Filming occurred on mainland [[China]] and [[Hong Kong]]. During ''Man of Tai Chi's'' five years of scripting and production, Reeves acted in several [[B movies]] with lead roles as Henry in 2010's ''[[Henry's Crime]]'' and John in 2012's ''[[Generation Um...]]''. During that time, Reeves also played Kai in the critically panned ''[[47 Ronin (2013 film)|47 Ronin]]''.<ref name="imdb"/> Critics widely attribute the film's direction, pacing, focus on special effects, and editing to its poor performance.

In 2011, he returned to other artistic mediums of expression. Having played music earlier in his career, he forayed into literature by writing the text for a "grown-up picture book" entitled ''Ode to Happiness''. The text was complimented by Alexandra Grant's illustrations.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.amazon.com/ODE-TO-HAPPINESS-Keanu-Reeves/dp/3869302097/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1340237299&sr=1-1&keywords=Keanu+Reeves|title=Ode to Happiness|author=Reeves, Keanu|year=2011|publisher=Steidl|isbn=3869302097}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13838742|title=Keanu Reeves' Ode to Happiness|publisher=BBC News|author=Hassan, Genevieve|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref> In 2011, he produced the documentary ''[[Side by Side (2012 film)|Side by Side]]'' about the supplanting of [[Photographic film|photo-chemical film]] by [[digital camera]] technology; Reeves interviewed several celebrated directors including [[James Cameron]], [[Martin Scorsese]], and [[Christopher Nolan]].
 
Reeves′s first directorial film, ''[[Man of Tai Chi]]'', premiered in 2013 with showings at the Beijing Film Festival<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/0520/Keanu-Reeves-spent-five-years-on-his-latest-film-Why |title=Keanu Reeves spent five years on his latest film: Why? |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=May 20, 2013 |accessdate=June 5, 2014 }}</ref> and [[2013 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/20/entertainment-us-cannes-reeves-idUSBRE94J0RO20130520|title=Keanu Reeves makes director debut with modern Kung Fu film|first=Mike|last=Davidson|date=May 20, 2013|agency=Reuters|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref> The work was awarded in Beijing and praised by recognized director of [[action film|action]] genre films, [[John Woo]].

Reeves has continued acting while exploring other forms of artistry. In October 2014, he played the title role in the action thriller ''[[John Wick (film)|John Wick]]''. The film, which stars Reeves as a retired hitman, opened to positive reviews and performed well at the box office.<ref name="imdb">{{IMDb name|206}}</ref> It has since been "Certified Fresh" by popular review site Rotten Tomatoes. 

===Future projects===
In January 2009, it was announced that Reeves would star in the live-action film adaptation of the anime series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'',<ref name="bebop">{{cite news|first=Borys|last=Kit|title=Reeves Leads Cast of Futuristic Bebop|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUKTRE50F0NE20090116|agency=Reuters UK|date=January 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name="siegel">{{cite news|first=Tatiana|last=Siegel|title=Keanu Reeves set for 'Bebop'|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998641.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|work=Variety|date=January 15, 2009|accessdate=May 31, 2009}}</ref> initially slated for release in 2011. Due to budgeting problems, the script was sent for a rewrite, and the project's status is currently unknown.

In April 2011, Reeves referenced that a third installment of the ''Bill & Ted'' series was possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/movies/news/keanu-reeves-confirms-that-bill-and-ted-3-is-on-the/211337|title=Keanu Reeves confirms that 'Bill And Ted 3' is on the way|work=NME|date=April 6, 2011}}</ref> He further elaborated on the film in December 2013 during a taping of NBC's ''[[The Today Show]]''. "I'm open to the idea of that...I think it's pretty surreal, playing 'Bill & Ted' at 50. But we have a good story in that.

During 2008, Reeves was sued in Los Angeles [[Superior Courts of California|Superior Court]] by [[paparazzi|paparazzo]] Alison Silva.

Do I believe in God, faith, inner faith, the self, passion, and things? Yes, of course! I’m very spiritual … Supremely spiritual … Bountifully spiritual … Supremely bountiful.

===Sad Keanu meme===
Reeves gained internet notoriety in 2010 when photos of him, seemingly depressed while eating alone, were posted to a [[4chan]] forum.

=== Stalker home invasions===
Reeves has had two stalker incidents occur at his [[Hollywood Hills]] home. On September 12, 2014, Reeves awoke and found a female stalker in his library, who told him that she was there to meet him. While Reeves calmly talked to her, he called 911 and alerted the police. They arrived, arrested her and took her in for psychological evaluation. On September 15, 2014, a second female stalker made her way into his home through a gate that was left unlocked by a cleaning company.
