'''John Howard Carpenter''' (born January 16, 1948) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer, editor and composer.  Although Carpenter has worked in numerous film genres, he is most commonly associated with horror and science fiction films from the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/movies/john-carpenter-directs-the-ward.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Lord of Fright Reclaims His Dark Domain|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Jason Zinoman|date=June 24, 2011}}</ref>

Most films in Carpenter's career were critical and commercial failures, with the notable exceptions of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981) and ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984). However,  many of Carpenter's films from the 1970s and the 1980s such as ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974), ''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'' (1976), ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980), ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), ''[[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]]'' (1983), ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987) and ''[[They Live]]'' (1988) have since been seen as [[Cult film|cult classics]], and Carpenter has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker.

==Early life==
Carpenter was born in [[Carthage, New York]], the son of Milton Jean (née Carter) and Howard Ralph Carpenter, a music professor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/John-Carpenter.html|work=Film Reference|title=John Carpenter Biography (1948–)}}</ref> He and his family moved to [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] in 1953.<ref name=kye>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D.

==Career==

===Student films and Academy Award===
In a beginning film course at [[USC Cinema]] in 1969, Carpenter wrote and directed an 8-minute short film, [[Captain Voyeur]]. The film was rediscovered in the USC archives in 2011 and proved interesting because it revealed elements that would appear in his later film, ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-carpenter-halloween-student-film-captain-voyeur-253747 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Mike | last=Barnes | title='Halloween' Director John Carpenter's First Student Film Unearthed | date=October 26, 2011}}</ref>

The following year he collaborated with producer [[John Longenecker]] as co-writer, film editor and music composer for ''[[The Resurrection of Broncho Billy]]'' (1970), which won an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. The short film was blown-up to 35mm, sixty prints were made, and the film was theatrically released by Universal Studios for two years in the United States and Canada.

===1970s: from student films to theatrical releases===
His first major film as director, ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974), was a science fiction black comedy that he cowrote with [[Dan O'Bannon]] (who later went on to write ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', borrowing freely from much of ''Dark Star''). The film reportedly cost only $60,000 and was difficult to make as both Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the film by multitasking, with Carpenter doing the musical score as well as the writing, producing and directing, while O'Bannon acted in the film and did the special effects (which caught the attention of [[George Lucas]] who hired him to do work on the special effects for ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]''). Carpenter's efforts did not go unnoticed as much of Hollywood marveled at his filmmaking abilities within the confines of a [[Low-budget film|shoestring budget]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/londtimes780308.html |title=John Carpenter: Press: London Times: 3-8-78 |publisher=Theofficialjohncarpenter.com |date=1978-03-08 |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref>

Carpenter's next film was ''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'' (1976), a low-budget thriller influenced by the films of [[Howard Hawks]], particularly ''[[Rio Bravo (1959 film)|Rio Bravo]]''. As with ''Dark Star'', Carpenter was responsible for many aspects of the film's creation. He not only wrote, directed and scored it, but also edited the film under the pseudonym "John T. Chance" (the name of [[John Wayne]]'s character in ''Rio Bravo''). Carpenter has said that he considers ''Assault on Precinct 13'' to have been his first real film because it was the first movie that he shot on a schedule.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldwasser |first=Dan |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=12 |title=John Carpenter - Interview |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date=2012-05-09 |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref> The film marked the first time Carpenter worked with [[Debra Hill]], who played prominently in the making of some of Carpenter's most important films.

Carpenter assembled a main cast that consisted of experienced but relatively obscure actors. The two leads were [[Austin Stoker]], who had appeared previously in science fiction, disaster and [[blaxploitation]] films, and [[Darwin Joston]], who had worked primarily in television and had once been Carpenter's next-door neighbor.<ref>Q & A session with John Carpenter and Austin Stoker at American Cinematheque's 2002 John Carpenter retrospective, in the ''Assault on Precinct 13'' 2003 special edition DVD.</ref>

The film received a critical reassessment in the United States, where it is now generally regarded as one of the best [[exploitation film]]s of the 1970s.<ref name=stills>Production Gallery (included in the 2003 special edition Region 1 DVD of ''Assault on Precinct 13''). 2003.</ref>

Carpenter both wrote and directed the Lauren Hutton thriller ''[[Someone's Watching Me!]]''. This TV movie is the tale of a single, working woman who, shortly after arriving in L.A., discovers that she is being [[stalked]].

''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) was a commercial hit and helped give birth to the [[slasher film]] genre. Originally an idea suggested by producer [[Irwin Yablans]] (titled ''The Babysitter Murders''), who envisioned a film about babysitters being menaced by a stalker, Carpenter took the idea and another suggestion from Yablans that it take place during Halloween and developed a story.<ref name="scifi1">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue339/interview.html |title=Syfy - Watch Full Episodes &#124; Imagine Greater |publisher=Scifi.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref> Carpenter said of the basic concept: "Halloween night. It has never been the theme in a film. My idea was to do an old haunted house movie."<ref name="theofficialjohncarpenter.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/rollingstone790628.html |title=John Carpenter: Press: Rolling Stone: 6-28-79 |publisher=Theofficialjohncarpenter.com |date=1979-06-28 |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref> The film was written by Carpenter and Debra Hill with Carpenter admitting that the music was inspired by both [[Dario Argento]]'s ''[[Suspiria]]'' (which also influenced the film's surreal color scheme) and [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.<ref name="theofficialjohncarpenter.com"/>

Carpenter again worked with a relatively small budget, $320,000.<ref>Audio commentary by John Carpenter and Debra Hill in ''The Fog'', 2002 special edition DVD</ref> The film grossed over $65 million initially, making it one of the most successful independent films of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houseofhorrors.com/halloween.htm |title=Halloween |publisher=Houseofhorrors.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref>

Carpenter has described ''Halloween'' as: "True crass exploitation. I decided to make a film I would love to have seen as a kid, full of cheap tricks like a haunted house at a fair where you walk down the corridor and things jump out at you."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/chic0879.html |title=John Carpenter: Press: Chic Magazine: August 1979 |publisher=Theofficialjohncarpenter.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref> The film has often been cited{{by whom|date=December 2012}} as an allegory on the virtue of sexual purity and the danger of casual sex, although Carpenter has explained that this was not his intent: "It has been suggested that I was making some kind of moral statement. Believe me, I'm not. In ''Halloween'', I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers."<ref name="scifi1"/>

In addition to the film's critical and commercial success, Carpenter's self-composed "Halloween Theme" became recognizable apart from the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/johncarpenter.html|title=Killing His Contemporaries: Dissecting The Musical Worlds Of John Carpenter}}</ref>

In 1979, John Carpenter began what was to be the first of several collaborations with actor [[Kurt Russell]] when he directed the TV movie ''[[Elvis (1979 film)|Elvis]]''.

===1980s: continued commercial success===
{{refimprove|section, except for just six sentences,|date=December 2012}}
Carpenter followed up the success of ''Halloween'' with ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980), a ghostly revenge tale (co-written by Hill) inspired by horror comics such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]''<ref>Interview with John Carpenter in the 2005 documentary film, ''Tales from the Crypt from Comic Books to Television.''</ref> and by ''[[The Crawling Eye]]'', a 1958 movie about monsters hiding in clouds.<ref name="Audio">Audio commentary by John Carpenter and Debra Hill in ''The Fog'', 2002 special edition DVD.''</ref>

Completing ''The Fog'' was an unusually difficult process for Carpenter. After viewing a rough cut of the film, he was dissatisfied with the result. For the only time in his filmmaking career, he had to devise a way to salvage a nearly finished film that did not meet his standards. In order to make the movie more coherent and frightening, Carpenter shot additional footage that included a number of new scenes.

Despite production problems and mostly negative critical reception, ''The Fog'' was another commercial success for Carpenter. The film was made on a budget of $1,000,000, but it grossed over $21,000,000 in the United States alone. Carpenter has said that ''The Fog'' is not his favorite film, although he considers it a "minor horror classic".<ref name="Audio"/>

Carpenter immediately followed ''The Fog'' with the science-fiction adventure ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981). Starring several actors that Carpenter had collaborated with ([[Donald Pleasence]], [[Adrienne Barbeau]], [[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]], [[Charles Cyphers]], and [[Frank Doubleday]]) or would collaborate with again ([[Kurt Russell]] and [[Harry Dean Stanton]]), as well as several highly notable actors ([[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Ernest Borgnine]]), it went on to become both commercially successful (grossing over $25 million) and critically acclaimed (with an 83% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1006717-escape_from_new_york/ |title=Escape from New York |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref>

His next film, ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), is notable for its high production values, including innovative special effects by [[Rob Bottin]], special visual effects by matte artist [[Albert Whitlock]], a score by [[Ennio Morricone]] and a cast including rising star Kurt Russell and respected character actors such as [[Wilford Brimley]], [[Richard Dysart]], [[Charles Hallahan]], [[Keith David]], and [[Richard Masur]]. ''The Thing'' was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].

Carpenter's film used the same source material as the 1951 Howard Hawks film, ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', Carpenter's version is more faithful to the [[John W. Campbell, Jr.]] novella, ''[[Who Goes There?]]'', upon which both films were based. Moreover, unlike the Hawks film, ''The Thing'' was part of what Carpenter later called his "Apocalypse Trilogy," a trio of films (''The Thing'', ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'', and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'') with bleak endings for the film's characters, and being a graphic, sinister [[horror film|horror]] film,<ref>[http://www.dareland.com/emulsionalproblems/carpenterjohn.htm ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> it did not appeal to audiences in the summer of 1982, especially when ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which would have illustrated a much more light-hearted picture of alien visitation, was released two weeks prior. In an interview, Carpenter stated that ''E.T.'''s release could have been largely responsible for the film's disappointment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2007/08/hollywood-gothique-some-thing-wicked-this-way-comes|title=John Carpenter's The Thing This Way Comes|first=Steve|last=Biodrowski|publisher=Cinefantastique}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Directors-Bu-Co/Carpenter-John.html |title=John Carpenter - Director - Films as Director:, Other Films:, Publications |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kindertrauma.com/?p=333 |title=John Carpenter’s The Thing |publisher=Kindertrauma.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kindertrauma.com/?p=334 |title=The Thing’s Monstrous Merchandise |publisher=Kindertrauma.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref> As ''The Thing'' did not perform well on a commercial level, it was Carpenter's first financial disappointment.

Shortly after completing post-production on ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', Universal offered him the chance to direct ''Firestarter'', based on the novel by Stephen King. Carpenter hired Bill Lancaster to adapt the novel into a script, which was completed in mid-1982. Carpenter had ear-marked Burt Lancaster to star as "Rainbird" and 12-year-old Jennifer Connelly as "Charly" but when The Thing was a box-office disappointment, Universal replaced Carpenter with Mark L Lester. Ironically, Carpenter's next film, ''[[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]]'', was the 1983 adaptation of the [[Stephen King]] novel of the same name. The story revolves around a high-school nerd named Arnie Cunningham ([[Keith Gordon]]) who buys a junked 1958 [[Plymouth Fury]] which turns out to have supernatural powers. As Cunningham restores and rebuilds the car, he becomes unnaturally obsessed with it, with deadly consequences. ''Christine'' did respectable business upon its release and was received well by critics; however, Carpenter has been quoted as saying he directed the film because it was the only thing offered to him at the time.<ref>Interview with John Carpenter on the DVD documentary film "Christine: Ignition"</ref>

''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984) was produced by [[Michael Douglas]], the script was well received by [[Columbia Pictures]], which chose it over the script for ''E.T.'' and prompted [[Steven Spielberg]] to go to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. Douglas chose Carpenter to be the director because of his reputation as an action director who could also convey strong emotion.<ref>[http://www.acmewebpages.com/articles/8412glob.htm ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> ''Starman'' was favorably reviewed by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[New York Times]]'' and [[LA Weekly]] and described by Carpenter as a film he envisioned as a romantic comedy similar to ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' only with a space alien.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/laheraldex841214.html |title=John Carpenter: Press: Los Angeles Herald Examiner: 12-14-84 |publisher=Theofficialjohncarpenter.com |date=1984-12-14 |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/laweekly841214.html |title=John Carpenter: Press: LA Weekly: 12-14/20-84 |publisher=Theofficialjohncarpenter.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref> The film received [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] and [[Golden Globe]] nominations for [[Jeff Bridges]]' portrayal of Starman and received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Musical Score for [[Jack Nitzsche]].
<!--
After seeing footage of ''Starman'', the executive producer of the Superman movie series, [[Ilya Salkind]], offered Carpenter the chance to direct the latest Alexander–Ilya Salkind fantasy epic ''[[Santa Claus: The Movie]]''. Salkind made the offer to Carpenter over lunch at The Ritz, and while he loved the idea of breaking from his normal traditions and directing a children's fantasy movie, he requested 24 hours to think over the offer. The next day he had drawn up a list of requirements should he direct the movie; they were: 100 percent creative control, the right to take over scriptwriting duties, being able to co-compose the movie's musical score, total editorial control, the casting of Brian Dennehey as Santa Claus and a $5 million signing-on fee (the same amount that the movie's star Dudley Moore was receiving). Salkind withdrew his offer for him to direct.
-->
Following the box office failure of his big-budget action–comedy ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), Carpenter struggled to get films financed. He returned to making lower budget films such as ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987), a film influenced by the [[BBC]] series ''[[Quatermass]]''. Although some of the films from this time, such as ''[[They Live]]'' (1988) did pick up a cult audience, he never again realized his mass-market potential.

Carpenter was also offered ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' in 1989, and met with writer William Peter Blatty (who also authored the novel on which it was based, ''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'') over the course of a week. However, the two clashed on the film's climax and Carpenter passed on the project. Blatty directed the film himself a year later. Carpenter said that although they fought over the ending, they held a mutual respect and talked about an interest they both shared: quantum physics.<ref>Gilles Boulenger. ''John Carpenter: Prince of Darkness''. Page 216</ref>

===1990s: commercial decline, and Halloween H20: 20 Years Later===
His 1990s career is characterized by a number of notable misfires: ''[[Memoirs of an Invisible Man (film)|Memoirs of an Invisible Man]]'' (1992), ''[[Village of the Damned (1995 film)|Village of the Damned]]'' (1995) and ''[[Escape from L.A.]]'' (1996) are examples of films that were critical and box office failures. Also notable from this decade are ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1994), yet another Lovecraftian homage which did not do well either at the box office or with critics,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_mouth_of_madness/ |title=In the Mouth of Madness |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref> and ''[[Vampires (film)|Vampires]]'' (1998), which starred [[James Woods]] as the leader of a band of vampire hunters in league with the Catholic Church.

John Carpenter was originally in the running to be the director for the ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) follow-up project, ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998). Since [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], the star actress from the original and the sequel ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981), wanted to reunite the cast and crew of the original film, she reached out to Carpenter to direct ''Halloween H20''. Carpenter agreed to direct the movie, but his starting fee as director was 10 million dollars. Carpenter rationalized this by believing the hefty fee was compensation for revenue he never received from the original ''Halloween'', a matter that was still a bit of contention between Carpenter and Halloween producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] even after twenty years had passed. When Akkad balked at Carpenter's fee, Carpenter walked away from the project. [[Steve Miner]] took over directing of ''Halloween H20'', which was a box office success and received generally favorable reviews.

===2000s: semi-retirement===
2001 saw the release of ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]''. 2005 saw remakes of ''Assault on Precinct 13'' and ''The Fog'', the latter being produced by Carpenter himself, though in an interview he defined his involvement as, "I come in and say hello to everybody.  Go home."

In 2007 [[Rob Zombie]] produced and directed ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'', a re-imagining of Carpenter's 1978 film that spawned a [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]] two years later.

Carpenter returned to the director's chair in 2005 for an episode of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's]] ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' series as one of the thirteen filmmakers involved in the first season. His episode, ''[[John Carpenter's Cigarette Burns|Cigarette Burns]]'', aired to generally positive reviews, and positive reactions from Carpenter fans, many of whom regard it as on par with his earlier horror classics. He has since contributed another original episode for the show's second season entitled "[[Pro-Life (Masters of Horror episode)|Pro-Life]]", about a young girl who is raped and impregnated by a demon and wants to have an abortion, but whose efforts are halted by her religious fanatic, gun-toting father and her three brothers.

===2010s: present===
''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'', Carpenter's first movie since 2001's ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'', premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 13, 2010. Carpenter narrated the video game ''[[F.E.A.R. 3]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36882/baddass-announcement-trailer-fear-3|title=Badass Announcement Trailer – F.E.A.R. 3|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> On October 10, 2010, Carpenter received the Lifetime Award from the Freak Show Horror Film Festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38362/john-carpenter-receive-lifetime-achievement-award-freak-show-horror-film-festival|title=John Carpenter to Receive Lifetime Achievement Award from the Freak Show Horror Film|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> On February 3, 2015, the indie label [[Sacred Bones Records]] released his album ''[[Lost Themes]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/85233/listen-new-track-john-carpenters-album-lost-themes/|title=John Carpenter's Lost Themes|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref>

==Techniques==
His films are characterized by minimalist lighting and photography, static cameras, use of [[steadicam]], and distinctive synthesized scores (usually self-composed).

With the exception of ''The Thing'', ''Starman'', ''Memoirs of an Invisible Man'', and ''The Ward'', he has scored all of his films (though some are collaborations), most famously the themes from ''Halloween'' and ''Assault on Precinct 13''. His music is generally synthesized with accompaniment from piano and atmospherics.

Carpenter is an outspoken proponent of [[widescreen]] filming, and all of his theatrical movies (with the exception of ''Dark Star'' and ''The Ward'') were filmed [[Anamorphic widescreen|anamorphic]] with a 2.35:1 or greater [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]]. ''The Ward'' was shot in [[Super 35]], the first time Carpenter has ever used that system. Carpenter has stated he feels that the [[35 mm film|35mm]] [[Panavision]] anamorphic format is "the best movie system there is", preferring it over both [[Digital cinematography|digital]] and [[3D film]].<ref name="outpost31interview">{{cite news|url=http://www.outpost31.com/QAJC.html |title=Interview with John Carpenter |work=outpost31.com|date=August 2012}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Many of Carpenter's films have been re-released on DVD as special editions with numerous bonus features. Examples of such are: the collector's editions of ''Halloween'', ''Escape From New York'', ''Christine'', ''The Thing'', ''Assault on Precinct 13'', ''Big Trouble In Little China'' and ''[[The Fog]]''. Some were re-issued with a new anamorphic widescreen transfer. In the UK, several of Carpenter's films have been released on DVD with audio commentary by Carpenter and his stars (''They Live'', with actor/wrestler [[Roddy Piper]], ''Starman'' with actor Jeff Bridges and ''Prince of Darkness'' with actor [[Peter Jason]]).

Carpenter has been the subject of the documentary film ''John Carpenter: The Man and His Movies'', and [[American Cinematheque]]'s 2002 retrospective of his films. Moreover, in 2006, the United States Library of Congress deemed ''Halloween'' to be "culturally significant" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2006.html |title=About This Program - National Film Preservation Board &#124; Programs &#124; Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref>

In 2010, writer and actor [[Mark Gatiss]] interviewed Carpenter about his career and films for his BBC documentary series ''[[A History of Horror]]''. Carpenter appears in all three episodes of the series.<ref name=horrorqa>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vcwm7 |title=A History of Horror with Mark Gatiss – Q&A with Mark Gatiss |accessdate=November 12, 2010 |publisher=BBC }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Carpenter met his future wife, actress [[Adrienne Barbeau]], on the set of his 1978 television movie ''Someone's Watching Me!''. Carpenter was married to Barbeau from January 1, 1979 to 1984. During their marriage, Barbeau starred in ''The Fog'', and also appeared in ''Escape from New York''.<ref name=Ebert>{{cite news | author= Roger Ebert | authorlink=Roger Ebert| title=Interview with Adrienne Barbeau|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800203/PEOPLE/2030301/1023 | accessdate=March 9, 2006 |date=February 3, 1980}}</ref> The couple had one son, John Cody Carpenter (born May 7, 1984).<ref>[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800043887/bio ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

Carpenter has been married to producer Sandy King since 1990. King produced a number of Carpenter's later feature films, including ''They Live'', ''In the Mouth of Madness'', ''Ghosts of Mars'', and ''Escape from L.A.'' She also functioned as script supervisor for some of these films as well, such as ''Starman'', ''Big Trouble in Little China'' and ''Prince of Darkness''.<ref>[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800019104/bio ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

He appeared in an episode of [[Animal Planet]]'s ''Animal Icons'' titled "It Came from Japan", where he discussed his love and admiration for the [[Godzilla (1954 film)|original ''Godzilla'' film]].

Carpenter is also a known supporter of video games as a media and art form and has a particular liking for the ''[[F.E.A.R. (series)|F.E.A.R.]]'' franchise in general, even going as far as offering himself as a spokesman and helping direct the cinematics for [[F.E.A.R. 3|the third game]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2010/04/08/john-carpenter-and-steve-niles-contributing-to-fear-3/ |title=John Carpenter and Steve Niles Contributing To ‘F.E.A.R. 3′ |publisher=Multiplayerblog.mtv.com |date=2010-04-08 |accessdate=2015-03-07}}</ref>
