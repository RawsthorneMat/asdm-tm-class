Milla's paternal family's estate was in Zlopek near [[Peć]]. Her paternal great-grandfather, Bogić Camić Jovović, was a flag-bearer of the [[Vasojevići]] [[clan]] and an officer in the guard of King [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]]; his wife was Milica, after whom Milla was named. Her paternal grandfather Bogdan Jovović was a commander in the [[Pristina]] military area. He investigated finances in [[Skopje]] and [[Sarajevo]], where he uncovered massive gold [[embezzlement]] by the military. He was punished for refusing to testify against a friend charged in the crime. This resulted in the government briefly imprisoning Jovović in [[Goli otok]]. Fearing arrest again, he escaped to [[Albania]] and later moved to [[Kiev]] (a different version of the story claims that he was the one who took the gold). Milla's father Bogić and his sister later joined their father Bogdan in Kiev, where both siblings graduated in [[medicine]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web | title = arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs |work= Mila Jovović peva zanimljive pesme | url = http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/07/18/srpski/F00071702.shtm | accessdate = March 25, 2006 }}</ref> Her mother Galina Loginova was born in [[Tuapse]] (now in Russia) but moved with her family in childhood to [[Dnipropetrovsk]] (now in Ukraine).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kino-teatr.ru/kino/acter/w/ros/2533/bio/ |script-title=ru:Логинова Галина Михайловна |language=Russian |date=March 30, 2013 |work=kino-teatr.ru |publisher= |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}</ref> Her mother acted in several films, including ''[[Vykrutasy]]'' (a.k.a.

== Modeling career ==
[[File:Milla Jovovich 2013.jpg|thumb|Jovovich at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
When Milla was eleven and living in Los Angeles her mother Galina wanted a new set of head shots for her, they were recommended to a male model turned photographer Carlos Reynosa. He became intrigued by her deep presence. After the shoot Carlos Reynosa recommended Galina take young Milla to the modelling agency he was represented by in Los Angeles called Prima / East West. Milla was signed to the agency upon arrival. A few days later, after shooting her first test, her pictures were shown to famed photographer Herb Ritz who immediately recognized the child Milla's beauty and strong persona. The next day Ritts booked the 11-year-old Milla for the cover of Italian magazine ''Lei'', and London style magazine ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]''.  The covers gave the young Milla her launch and soon after legendary photographer Richard Avedon hired her for the American Edition of ''Mademoiselle''. When the magazine became aware of Milla's age they refused to run the cover insisting that the magazine was a Women's magazine. Avedon threatened to stop shooting for the publication if they did not honor his artistic choice and the magazine relented and ran the cover, making eleven-year-old Milla the youngest model to ever appear on the cover of an American Women's Fashion Magazine. Avedon was also head of marketing at [[Revlon]] at the time, and chose young Milla to appear with established models Alexa Singer and Sandra Zatezalo in Revlon's "Most Unforgettable Women in the World" advertisements.

It was Milla's early work with Ritz, Avedon and Peter Lindbergh that led to her success in advertising, bringing the young model contracts and covers for both ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.<ref name=SSS/> Since then, she has been featured on more than 100 magazine covers, including all the major fashion magazines in the US.<ref>{{cite web | title = Profile of Milla Jovovich | publisher = [[Fashion Model Directory]]| url= http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/Milla_Jovovich | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref> She has been part of campaigns for [[Banana Republic (clothing retailer)|Banana Republic]], [[Christian Dior]], [[Damiani (jewelry company)|Damiani]], [[Donna Karan]], [[Gap (clothing)|Gap]], [[Versace]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[DKNY]], [[Coach, Inc.|Coach]], [[Giorgio Armani]], [[H&M]], and [[Revlon]].

=== International success (2002–2006) ===
[[File:Milla Jovovich2(cannesBlueCarpet).jpg|thumb|upright|Jovovich at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
In 2002, Jovovich starred in the horror/action film ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'', released in the United States on March 15, 2002 and based on the [[Capcom|CAPCOM]] video game series of the [[Resident Evil|same name]]. She portrayed [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]], the film's heroine, who fights a legion of [[zombie]]s created by the [[Umbrella Corporation]]. Jovovich had accepted the role because she and her brother Marco had been fans of the video game franchise.<ref>{{cite web | title = Resident Evil (2002) | publisher = millaj.com| url= http://www.millaj.com/film/resident.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref> Jovovich had performed all the stunts required in the film, except for a scene that would involve her jumping to a cement platform, which her management deemed too dangerous,<ref>''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' DVD commentary (2002)</ref> and had trained in [[karate]], [[kickboxing]], and combat-training.<ref>{{cite news | last= Bradberry| first= Grace| title= Modern Milla| magazine= [[InStyle|InStyle (UK)]]| date = July 2002| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/instyleuk0702.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013| postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref> The film was commercially successful, grossing $17 million on its opening weekend, and gaining $40 million domestically and $102 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | title = Resident Evil | publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]]| url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=residentevil.htm | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref> Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in ''[[No Good Deed (2002 film)|No Good Deed]]'' (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy ''[[You Stupid Man]]'' (2002), punk rocker Fangora ("Fanny") in ''[[Dummy (film)|Dummy]]'' (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series ''[[King of the Hill]]''. The role of Fangora in ''Dummy'' allowed Jovovich to act in film with [[Oscar Award|Oscar]]-winning [[Adrien Brody]], who was a friend prior to filming. Jovovich found it easy to identify with this role because she felt Fangora possessed similar qualities to the actress' own life.<ref name="Leeloo" />

In 2004, Jovovich reprised the role of Alice in the sequel to ''Resident Evil'', ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]''. The role required her to do fight training for three hours a day,<ref name="Leeloo" /> in addition to the three months prior to filming in which she had "gun training, martial arts, everything".<ref>{{cite news | last= Grove| first= David| title= Alice Get Your Guns| magazine= Film Review (UK)| date = September 2004| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/filmreview0904.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013| postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref> ''Apocalypse'' received even more negative reactions from the critics than the first film, but it was an even greater commercial success, ranking number one at the box office unlike the first film. Following the release of the film, Jovovich was unhappy with the critical results and director [[Alexander Witt]]'s effort.<ref name="punk" /> She noted during an interview that year that her large action films take care of the commercial part of her career, while she acts in "independent little films that never come out" to appease her artistic side, and "It's a good balance".<ref name="Leeloo" /> The following year, she was featured in [[Gore Vidal]]'s faux trailer remake of ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'', as [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]]. In 2006, Jovovich's film, the [[science fiction]]/action thriller ''[[Ultraviolet (film)|Ultraviolet]]'', was released on March 3. She played the title role of Violet Song jat Shariff, a role that also involved heavily choreographed fight sequences. It was not screened for critics, but when reviewed, it was critically panned,<ref name="Tomatoes">{{cite web | title = Ultraviolet | publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10004504-ultraviolet/ | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref> grossing $31 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ultraviolet | publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]]| url = http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ultraviolet.htm | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref> That year, Jovovich also starred in ''[[.45 (film)|.45]]'', as Kat, the revenge driven girlfriend of an illegal gun and drug dealer with Scottish actor and DJ Angus Macfadyen.

=== Recent and future roles (2007–present) ===
In 2007, Jovovich reprised her role as Alice in ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'', the third of the ''Resident Evil'' series. The film grossed an estimated $24 million in 2,828 theaters on its opening weekend, topping the box office gross for that week.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=residentevil3.htm | title = Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) | accessdate =May 15, 2013 | publisher =[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> It opened stronger than its predecessor, ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'', which opened with $23 million in 3,284 theaters (over 450 more theaters than ''Extinction'').<ref>{{cite web | title = Resident Evil: Apocalypse | publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]]| url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=residentevilapocalypse.htm | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref> In a March 2006 interview, Jovovich said that she would not appear in another action film "for a long time", expressing a desire to portray more diverse roles,{{Citation needed | date = July 2010}} but she added that talks of another sequel in the ''Resident Evil'' franchise were a "real possibility".<ref>{{cite news | first= David | last= Germain| date =23 September 2007 | title = 'Resident Evil' rules weekend box office | agency = Associated Press| url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2007-09-23-1945988660_x.htm | accessdate = May 15, 2013 | work=USA Today}}</ref><ref>{{youtube|id=kSAv4lk_hJs | title = Milla Jovovich Goes To Chateau Marmont On Friday Night}}</ref>

Jovovich is set to star in [[David R. Ellis]]' horror film ''Bad Luck'', based on a screenplay by [[David J. Schow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviehole.net/201025081-david-r-ellis-on-war-monkeys-genesis-code-and-bad-luck |title=David R.

Jovovich was set to portray Amalia Bezhetskaya in ''The Winter Queen'' in 2007; however, with the announcement of her pregnancy early that year, the film was postponed. In the spring of 2011, Seven Arts and GFM Films announced they would be merging their distribution operations. The joint venture is expected to release ''The Winter Queen'' under the direction of [[Fyodor Bondarchuk]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Seven Arts Announces New Distribution Venture With GFM Films|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=conewsstory&tkr=SAPXF:US&sid=aTfBCpRLV_7I|accessdate=May 15, 2013|newspaper=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=31 March 2011|agency=[[Marketwire]]|location=Hollywood|quote=The Venture will formally launch at this year's Cannes Film Festival focusing its efforts on Seven Arts' upcoming titles including "The Winter Queen" to be directed by Fedor Bonderchuk and starring Milla Jovovich and "Neuromancer," the sci-fi epic based on the best selling novel by William Gibson which will be directed by Vincenzo Natali.}}</ref>

== Music career ==
Jovovich had begun working on a music album as early as 1988, when she was signed by [[SBK Records]] after the company heard a demo she recorded.<ref name="music">{{cite web | title = Milla's Music | publisher = millaj.com| url= http://www.millaj.com/music/tdc.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref> In August 1990, she asserted in an interview that the then-forthcoming album would be "a mix between [[Kate Bush]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[This Mortal Coil]], and the [[Cocteau Twins]]".<ref>{{cite news | title = Milla| magazine= [[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone (Australia)]] | date = August 1990| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/rs890.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013| postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref> After it was initially presented by SBK strictly as a [[pop music|pop]] album, Jovovich protested, insisting on using her personal poetry for lyrics and recording her own instrumental material.<ref name="music" /> Jovovich had written the songs when she was fifteen, with the exception of a Ukrainian folk song, "In a Glade", that she covered. In April 1994, billed under her first name, she released ''[[The Divine Comedy (Milla Jovovich album)|The Divine Comedy]]'', a title that was a reference to the [[epic poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]] of the [[Divine Comedy|same name]]. Jovovich had chosen the title after seeing Russian artist Alexis Steele's proposed cover artwork sketch for the then untitled album. Jovovich found that the sketch had "all the struggle that I'm singing about. It IS the divine comedy".<ref name="music" /> ''The Divine Comedy'' was well received by critics, and featured pop-infused traditional Ukrainian folk songs that led to comparisons with musicians [[Tori Amos]] and [[Kate Bush]].<ref name="Wang" /> John McAlley of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called the album "remarkable", "strikingly mature and rich in invention", and as featuring "angst-laced poetry with vivid melodies and arrangements that find a common spirit in synth pop, European folk and psychedelic dream rock".<ref>{{Cite news | last = McAlley | first = John | title = The Divine Comedy | magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = April 1994 | url= http://www.millaj.com/music/reviews/rsreview.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013 | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref>

Jovovich released the track "Gentleman Who Fell", with an accompanying [[music video]], as the sole single from the album. The music video was originally directed by [[Lisa Bonet]] and featured [[Harry Dean Stanton]], but Jovovich was unsatisfied with the results and decided to film another version. The second version of "Gentleman Who Fell", a homage to [[Maya Deren]]'s short film ''[[Meshes of the Afternoon]]'' (1943), was subsequently played on [[MTV]]. Jovovich toured the United States during most of 1994 to promote the album, opening for [[Toad the Wet Sprocket]] and [[Crash Test Dummies]], as well as playing smaller acoustic sets. Jovovich had opted to perform in smaller and more intimate settings, turning down a musical appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Milla has also been collaborating musically with longtime friend and musician Chris Brenner, who co-wrote with her on the Divine Comedy Album and who was the musical coordinator for the supporting tour. She and Brenner met in 1993 and have since worked together on several ventures.<ref name="Oxymoron">{{cite news | last= Boardman| first= Mickey| title= Generation Oxymoron| magazine= Paper| date = Summer 1994| url= http://www.millaj.com/art/paper94.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013| postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref> Following ''The Divine Comedy'', she expressed interest in releasing a second album, having had ten songs ready for a future recording that was intended for a Summer 1996 release.<ref name="Europe" /><ref name="cafe" /> Despite the appearance of a lo-fi field recording [[The People Tree Sessions]] in 1998, Jovovich has yet to release a second album.

In May 1999, Jovovich along with Chris Brenner formed an experimental band called Plastic Has Memory, in which she wrote the songs, sang, and played electric guitar.<ref>{{cite web | last= Lessing| first= Pieter| title= West Hollywood, California June 17, 1999 review | publisher = millaj.com|date=June 1999| url= http://www.millaj.com/music/reviews/luna61799.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref> The band was "[m]uch heavier and darker than the vaguely Ukrainian folk-sounding elements of her first album" and had a similar sound to a [[grunge]] and [[trip hop]] [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].<ref>{{cite web | last= Lewis| first= Richard| title= Review from Richard Lewis' Concert Calendar | publisher = millaj.com |date=June 1999 | url = http://www.millaj.com/music/reviews/luna61799.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013 }}</ref> Plastic Has Memory played about a dozen shows in Los Angeles and New York City for a potential [[Virgin Records]] album release,<ref>{{cite web | last = Ehrman | first = Mark | title = Milla goes Luna | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times Magazine]] | date = 1999-09-05 | url= http://www.millaj.com/pics/latimesmag9599.jpg | accessdate = May 15, 2013 }}</ref> one of which [[Mick Jagger]] had attended.<ref>{{cite news | last= Manning| first= Kara| title= Milla Jovovich On The Bono-Mick Jagger Connection | publisher = MTV| date = 1999-11-11| url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430715/19991111/story.jhtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref> Though Plastic Has Memory was featured on ''[[Hollywood Goes Wild]]'', a benefit celebrity compilation album, the group never formally released a record and is no longer together.<ref>{{cite web | title = Plastic Has Memory | publisher = millaj.com| url= http://www.millaj.com/music/plastic.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref>

Jovovich has contributed tracks to several of her film soundtracks, including ''[[The Million Dollar Hotel]]'' (2000) and ''[[Dummy (film)|Dummy]]'' (2002), and has also provided songs for the soundtracks of films in which she has not acted such as ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' (2003) produced by musician Danny Lohner who was the bass player in [[Nine Inch Nails]] for many years.  Her song "The Gentlemen Who Fell" was featured on the [[The Rules of Attraction]] soundtrack in 2002. In 2001, Jovovich was one of many celebrities whose vocals were featured in a cover of "We are Family" to raise money for the [[American Red Cross]]. She has appeared as guest vocalist on the song "Former Lover" on [[Deepak Chopra]]'s album, ''A Gift of Love II: Oceans of Ecstasy'' (2002) and ''[[Legion of Boom]]'' (2004) by [[The Crystal Method]].

Since 2003, Jovovich has worked with musician [[Maynard James Keenan]], of [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and [[A Perfect Circle]], on his [[Industrial music|Industrial]] side project [[Puscifer]],<ref>{{cite web | title = James Maynard Keenan Cooks Up New Side Project Puscifer | publisher = [[Sony]] | url = http://www.sonybmg.com.au/news/details.do?newsId=20030829004347 | accessdate = May 15, 2013 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080815005146/http://www.sonybmg.com.au/news/details.do?newsId=20030829004347 | archivedate=2008-08-15}}</ref> contributing vocals to the track "REV 22:20", which was featured on various film soundtracks in its original or a remixed form.<ref>{{cite web | title = Rocket Collecting | publisher = millaj.com| url = http://www.millaj.com/music/index.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref> As of January, 2009, she can be heard collaborating with Maynard and Danny Lohner on the Puscifer track called, "The Mission."

Danny Lohner, and longtime music collaborator Chris Brenner currently continue to record and perform with Jovovich who has made several highly praised appearances in recent years.

Jovovich continues to write songs which she refers to as "demos", and which are provided for free in [[MP3]] format on her official website. She provides license to freely download and remix the tracks, but reserves the right to sell and issue them.<ref>{{cite web | title = Current Demos | publisher = millaj.com | url = http://www.millaj.com/music/demos.shtml | accessdate = May 15, 2013}}</ref>

== Fashion design ==
Jovovich and fellow model Carmen Hawk launched a line of clothing called [[Jovovich-Hawk]] in 2003. The pair opened a showroom in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] on September 13, 2005, and the line lasted for four years. All of the dresses for Jovovich-Hawk line were designed by herself and her partner Carmen Hawk, in The [[studio|atelier]] is based in Los Angeles, but pieces could be found at [[Fred Segal]] in Los Angeles, [[Harvey Nichols]], and over 50 stores around the world.
