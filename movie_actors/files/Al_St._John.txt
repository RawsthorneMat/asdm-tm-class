'''Al St. John''' (September 10, 1892 &ndash; January 21, 1963) was an American film actor. In his persona of ''Fuzzy Q. Jones'', St. John basically defined the role and concept of "[[sidekick|comical sidekick]]" to cowboy heroes from 1930 to 1951.

==Biography==
Born in [[Santa Ana, California]], he entered silent films around 1912 and soon rose to co-starring and starring roles in short comic films from a variety of studios. His uncle, [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]], may have helped him in his early days at [[Mack Sennett]] Studios, but talent kept him working. He was a remarkable acrobat. St. John frequently appeared as Arbuckle's mischievously villainous rival for the attentions of leading ladies such as [[Mabel Normand]] and worked with Arbuckle and [[Charles Chaplin]] in ''[[The Rounders (1914 film)|The Rounders]]'' (1914). The most critically praised film from St. John's period with Arbuckle remains ''[[Fatty and Mabel Adrift]]'' (1916) with Normand.

When Arbuckle formed his own production company, he brought St. John with him and recruited stage star [[Buster Keaton]] into his films, creating a formidable roughhouse trio. After Arbuckle was victimized by a trumped-up scandal that prevented him from appearing in movies, he pseudonymously directed his nephew Al as a comic leading man in silent and sound films such as ''The Iron Mule'' (1925) and ''Bridge Wives'' (1932). Dozens of St. John's early films were screened during the 56-film [[Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle|Arbuckle]] retrospective at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]] in 2006.

During the sound era St. John was mainly seen as an increasingly scruffy and bearded comic character. He played this rube role in [[Buster Keaton]]'s 1937 comedy ''Love Nest on Wheels''. That same year he began supporting cowboy stars Fred Scott and later Jack Randall, but most of his films were made for [[Poverty Row]] studio [[Producers Releasing Corporation]] (PRC). For that studio, he played "Fuzzy Q. Jones" in the ''[[Billy the Kid (film series)|Billy the Kid]]'' series starring [[Bob Steele (actor)|Bob Steele]], the ''Lone Rider'' series (starring [[George F. Houston|George Houston]] and later Bob Livingston), and the ''Billy the Kid/Billy Carson'' series starring [[Buster Crabbe]].

The name ''Fuzzy'' originally belonged to a different actor, [[Fuzzy Knight|John Forrest “Fuzzy“ Knight]], who took on the role of ''cowboy sidekick'' before St. John. As the studio first intended to hire Knight for the western series but then gave the role to St. John instead, who took on the nickname of his rival for his screen character. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Exhibitors loved [[Fuzzy Knight|Fuzzy]], who could be counted on to attract moviegoers. Fuzzy's character was the main box-office draw in these films when shown in England and Europe. These ultra-low-budget Westerns took only a bit more than a week to film, so that Crabbe and St. John made 36 films together in a surprisingly short time. When Crabbe left PRC (according to interviews, in disgust at their increasingly low budgets), St. John was paired with new star [[Lash LaRue]]. Ultimately, St. John made more than 80 Westerns as Fuzzy.

St. John also created a character, "Stoney," in the film ''[[The Law of 45's]]'' that later appeared, but played by different actors (including [[John Wayne]]), in the continuing Western film series ''[[The Three Mesquiteers]]''.

St. John's last film was released in 1952. From that time on until his death in 1963 in [[Lyons, Georgia]], he made personal appearances at fairs and rodeos, and traveled with the Tommy Scott Wild West Show. Altogether, Al St. John acted in 346 movies, spanning four decades from 1912 to 1952. He was working with a traveling Wild West show in Georgia and was waiting to go on when he suffered a massive heart attack and died at age 70. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
