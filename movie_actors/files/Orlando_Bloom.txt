==Career==
[[Image:OrlandoBloomJuly06.jpg|thumb|150px|Bloom at the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' London premiere, July 2006]]
Bloom's first appearance on the screen was in a small role, as a [[rent boy]], in the 1997 film ''[[Wilde (film)|Wilde]]''. Two days after graduating from Guildhall in 1999,<ref name="Bloomsinterview507"/> he was cast in his first major role, playing [[Legolas]] in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] (2001–2003).<ref name="APStory"/> He had originally auditioned for the part of [[Faramir]], who does not appear until the second movie, but the director, [[Peter Jackson]], cast him as Legolas instead. While shooting a scene, he broke a rib after falling off a horse, but eventually recovered and continued shooting.<ref name="wildabout">{{cite news|last=Nasson|first=Tim|title=Orlando Bloom Interview|pages=|publisher=Wild About Movies|date=2005-1166-06|url=http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/interviews/WildAboutMoviesOrlandoBloom_Interview_ElizabethtownMovie.php|accessdate=24 May 2007}}</ref> At the same time, Bloom also played a brief role in the war film ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' as PFC. Todd Blackburn. In 2002, he was chosen as one of the ''[[Teen People]]'' "25 Hottest Stars Under 25" and was named ''[[People (magazine)|People']]''s hottest Hollywood bachelor in the magazine's 2004 list.<ref name="APStory" /> All members of the cast of the Rings films were nominated for Best Ensemble Acting at the [[Screen Actors Guild|Screen Actors Guild Awards]] for three years in a row, finally winning in 2003 for the third film, [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]].  Bloom has also won other awards, including [[European Film Awards]], Hollywood Festival Award, [[Sony Ericsson Empire Awards|Empire Awards]] and [[Teen Choice Award]]s, and has been nominated for many others. Most of Bloom's box office successes have been as part of an [[ensemble cast]].<ref name="teenhollywood">{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Alison|title=Celebrity Interview: Where There's a Will...|publisher=TeenHollywood.com|date=23 May 2007|url=http://www.teenhollywood.com/2007/05/23/celebrity-interview-where-theres-a-will|accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref>

Bloom next starred opposite [[Keira Knightley]] and [[Johnny Depp]] in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', which was a blockbuster hit during the summer of 2003. After the success of ''Pirates'', Bloom next took to the screen as Paris, the man who effectively started the [[Trojan War]], in the 2004 Spring blockbuster, ''[[Troy (film)|Troy]]'' opposite [[Brad Pitt]], [[Eric Bana]] and [[Peter O'Toole]]. He subsequently played the lead roles in ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' and ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'' (both 2005). In 2006, Bloom starred in sequel ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' and in the independently made ''[[Haven (film)|Haven]]'', of which he was also executive producer. In the same year he was one of the guest stars in the sitcom ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', in which he portrayed an exaggeratedly arrogant, [[narcissistic]] version of himself who had a great loathing for [[Johnny Depp]] (his co-star in ''Pirates of the Caribbean''); Bloom pushed for ''Extras'' to go further by making his part unlikeable, and contributed to the gag about him admiring Depp out of sheer jealously, that Depp was far more talented than he was, not to mention rated higher than him on the 'top hottest' charts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gordon |first=Scott |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/57393/2 |title=Ricky Gervais The A.V.
