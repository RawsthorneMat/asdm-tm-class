They wrote and directed its two sequels ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' (both in 2003), and were heavily involved in the writing and production of other works in [[The Matrix (franchise)|the franchise]].

Following the commercial success of the ''Matrix'' series, they wrote and produced the 2006 film ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' (an adaptation of the [[V for Vendetta|comic of the same name]] by [[Alan Moore]]), and in 2008 released the film ''[[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]]'', which was a live action adaptation of the Japanese anime series, ''[[Speed Racer]]''. Their next film, ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]'', based on the [[Cloud Atlas (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]] and co-written and co-directed by [[Tom Tykwer]], was released on October 26, 2012.

==Career==

===Early work===
Prior to working in the film industry, the Wachowskis wrote comic books for [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Razorline]] imprint, namely ''[[Ectokid]]'' (created by horror novelist [[Clive Barker]]) in 1993, as well as writing for [[Epic Comics]]' ''[[Hellraiser (comics)|Clive Barker's Hellraiser]]'' and ''[[Nightbreed (comics)|Clive Barker's Nightbreed]]'' comic series.

In the mid-1990s they branched out into film writing, creating the script for ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'' in 1994. [[Warner Brothers]] bought the script and included two more pictures in the contract.<ref name="Godoski"/> ''Assassins'' was "totally rewritten" by [[Brian Helgeland]]<ref name="Asitecalledfred.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.asitecalledfred.com/interviews/27.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120725034551/http://www.asitecalledfred.com/interviews/27.html |archivedate=2012-07-25 |title=The Lost Wachowski Brothers Interview |publisher=Asitecalledfred.com via web.archive.org |accessdate=July 2, 2014}}</ref> and the Wachowskis tried unsuccessfully to remove their names from the film.<ref name="NewYorker"/> They then moved on to their next project, the [[neo-noir]] thriller ''[[Bound (film)|Bound]]'', their debut as directors. The film was well received for its style and craft,<ref name="Tomatoes">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bound/ |title=Bound |accessdate=July 8, 2012 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> and was noted as one of the first mainstream films to prominently feature a homosexual relationship without it being central to the plot.<ref name="LaSalle">{{Cite news | last =LaSalle | first =Mick | author-link =Mick LaSalle | title =Darkly Witty 'Bound' a Taut Noir Caper | newspaper =[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date =October 4, 1996 | accessdate = May 28, 2007 | url =http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/10/04/DD42774.DTL | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> Taking advantage of the positive buzz, the Wachowskis asked to direct their next picture, ''[[The Matrix]]''.<ref name="Godoski"/>

===''The Matrix'' franchise===
{{main|The Matrix (franchise)|l1=The Matrix franchise}}

Their next film, ''The Matrix,'' was completed in 1999. It proved to be a success, and spawned two sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', both released in 2003.

===Later work===
The Wachowskis' next feature-film project was ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'', an adaptation of [[Alan Moore]]'s comic book [[V for Vendetta|of the same name]]. They wrote and produced the film with Matrix producer Joel Silver, who had previously purchased the film rights to the novel. The film was directed by Wachowski collaborator [[James McTeigue]]. The production proceeded without the participation of Moore, who was disappointed with previous Hollywood adaptations of his work, and disagreed with differences between the screenplay and his novel, is not credited. The film's controversial story line and themes have been the target of both criticism and praise from sociopolitical groups. It was released in 2006 and was well received critically and was a box office success, although not on the scale of the Matrix films.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=rottentomatoes.com | title=V for Vendetta (2006) | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/v_for_vendetta/ | accessdate=July 8, 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, the Wachowskis and McTeigue were hired to revamp ''[[The Invasion (film)|The Invasion]]'' for Warner Brothers. The studio was disappointed in the film as produced by director [[Oliver Hirschbiegel]] and hired the Wachowskis to rewrite the script and add new scenes, which McTeigue directed. The film, the fourth adaptation of the novel ''[[The Body Snatchers]]'', was not a critical or box office success. The Wachowskis and McTeigue are not credited on the film for their involvement.<ref name="behind">{{cite news |author=Nicole Sperling |author2=Christine Spines |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20050837,00.html |title=Hidden 'Invasion' |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=August 10, 2007 |accessdate=August 18, 2007}}</ref>

The Wachowskis returned to directing with 2008's ''[[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]]''. The film was an adaptation of a Japanese manga series from the 1950s, which was itself made into an 1960s anime TV series. Upon release the movie was considered a critical and [[Box office bomb|commercial disappointment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987417.html?categoryid=2508&cs=1 |title=Why 'Speed Racer' sputtered |accessdate=June 18, 2008 |author=Anne Thompson |date=June 18, 2008 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> While its special effects were noted as outstanding, the storyline is considered lacking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/speed_racer/|title=Speed Racer|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]}}</ref> It was also nominated in the category of "Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel" for the [[29th Golden Raspberry Awards]]. Its box office gross was $93 million compared to a production budget of $120 million. However in later years critics periodically have put the film on lists of underrated or [[cult films]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/24649/top-50-underrated-films-of-the-2000s|title=Top 50 underrated films of the 2000s|work=Den of Geek|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/15-movies-the-critics-got-wrong|title=15 Movies the Critics Got Wrong|publisher=|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5954595/10-reasons-why-speed-racer-is-an-unsung-masterpiece|title=10 Reasons Why Speed Racer Is an Unsung Masterpiece|work=io9|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/the-unpopular-opinion-speed-racer|title=The UnPopular Opinion: Speed Racer|publisher=|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/10/25/speed_racer_the_wachowskis_masterpiece_is_underrated.html|title=Speed Racer: The Wachowskis' masterpiece is underrated.|date=October 25, 2012|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref>

Their next directorial outing was ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]'', adapted from [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]]'s [[Cloud Atlas (novel)|2004 novel]], which drew mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cloud_atlas_2012/#top-critics-numbers |title=Cloud Atlas (2012) |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}</ref> The Wachowskis subsequently produced and directed ''[[Jupiter Ascending]]'', an original science fiction screenplay they wrote. The film was released February 2015.<ref>{{cite web |work=Deadline |first=Mike |last=Fleming |date=October 20, 2011 |accessdate=July 19, 2012|title=Lana and Andy Wachowski Return To Sci-Fi Action Arena With 'Jupiter Ascending' |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/10/lana-and-andy-wachowski-return-to-sci-fi-action-arena-with-jupiter-ascending/}}</ref> It stars [[Channing Tatum]] and [[Mila Kunis]], and features the Wachowskis' regular collaborators [[John Gaeta]] on the visual effects and [[Kym Barrett]] on costumes.

===Future works===
In 2008,<ref name="previewsworld"/> the Wachowskis were producing for [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] an animated film based on their [[Burlyman Entertainment|comic book company]]'s ''Shaolin Cowboy'',<ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/c2e2-top-artists-100128.html C2E2 Announces Ten Top Artist Appearances] Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo press release.</ref><ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002955.html?categoryid=18&cs=1 "Circle of Confusion hires Emery"].

Warner Bros. has expressed interest in ''Hood'', a modern adaptation of the [[Robin Hood]] legend, which the Wachowskis wrote and plan to direct. They also wrote an [[Iraq war]]-set gay romance conspiracy thriller titled ''CN-9'' (or ''Cobalt Neural 9''); however, the project failed to find financing.<ref name="HR"/> However the siblings are still keen to make it, even if it has to be made in a different form than film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Tasha |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-wachowskis-explain-how-cloud-atlas-unplugs-peo,87900/2/ |title=The Wachowskis explain how Cloud Atlas unplugs people from the Matrix &#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V.

The siblings are also shopping around a concept for a TV series dubbed ''Sense8'' that they have developed with ''Ninja Assassin'' collaborator [[J. Michael Straczynski]]. In their pursuit of the concept the Wachowskis have penned three [[spec script]]s that are said to resemble their unique storytelling style seen in ''The Matrix'' films, and they plan to direct at least a few episodes of the series, should it be made. Producer [[Marc Rosen]] of Georgeville Television (GTTV), describes the project as ''"an idea so big in size and scale that it doesn't make sense to try it as a pilot. The only way to let the filmmakers realize their vision on something like this is to do multiple episodes."''<ref>{{cite news|last=Littleton |first=Cynthia |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118060175 |title=Wachowskis shopping their first TV series |work=Variety |date=October 2, 2012 |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}</ref> On March 27, 2013 it was announced ten episodes will be made to be streamed on Netflix late 2014.<ref>Lawler, Richard.

''Engadget''.</ref> The series which belongs to the genre of science fiction is described as ''"a gripping global tale of minds linked and souls hunted"'' which was conceived by the showrunners ''"after a late night conversation about the ways technology simultaneously unites and divides us"''.

Lana stated that after the release of ''Jupiter Ascending'' and ''Sense8'', they are going to take a [[sabbatical]] because they have worked six years without a break.<ref name="yahoomovies">{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/news/wachowskis-hope-surprise-next-film-183313417.html|title=Wachowskis hope to surprise with next film|date=October 25, 2013|work=Yahoo Movies}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Lana-Wachowski-India-should-relax-more-around-LGBT-issues/articleshow/45110657.cms|title=Lana Wachowski: India should relax more around LGBT issues|work=The Times of India|accessdate=November 12, 2014}}</ref> The Wachowskis also wrote the script of ''Carnivore'' and the script of ''Plastic Man'', the latter based on the DC Comics [[Plastic Man|superhero of the same name]].

===Style===
The siblings admit to a love for telling multipart stories. "Because we grew up on comic books and the [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] [[The Lord of the Rings|trilogy]], one of the things we're interested in is bringing serial fiction to cinema," Lana has said. Andy puts his desire to shake up viewers a bit more bluntly: "We think movies are fairly boring and predictable. We want to screw with audiences' expectations."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/341821 |title=Larry Wachowski |publisher=Filmbug|date=February 25, 2005 |accessdate=July 19, 2012}}</ref> In terms of themes that run through their body of work, Lana has cited "the inexplicable nature of the universe [being] in constant dialogue with our own consciousness and our consciousness actually affect[ing] the inexplicable nature of the universe,"<ref name="ukscreen"/> "interconnectivity and about truth beneath the surface"<ref>McGrath, Charles (October 9, 2012) [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/movies/cloud-atlas-as-rendered-by-tom-tykwer-and-the-wachowskis.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& Bending Time, Bending Minds]. The New York Times.</ref> and "the paradox of choice and choicelessness".<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia_mZ7IjBQM Lana And Andy Wachowski New Matrix, Jupiter Ascending, Sign Vendetta Mask @ Cloud Atlas Gala London]. YouTube (February 18, 2013).</ref> The Wachowskis cited the art of comic book artist Geof Darrow as an influence on the look of ''The Matrix''. Also, they stated that ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Ninja Scroll]]'', and ''[[Akira (film)|Akira]]'' as anime that inspired them. "in anime, one thing that they do that we tried to bring to our film was a juxtaposition of time and space in action beats.

The Wachowskis cited [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' as one of their main inspirations for ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]''.<ref>Corliss, Richard. (October 25, 2012) [http://entertainment.time.com/2012/10/25/cloud-atlas-the-wachowskis-struggle-in-the-stratosphere/ 'Cloud Atlas' Movie Review: The Wachowskis Struggle in the Stratosphere]. ''Time''.</ref> They first saw the film when they were seven and ten respectively.<ref name="NewYorker"/>

Lana's most influential films are ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Ma vie en rose]]'' and ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/sam-taylor-johnson-lisa-cholodenko-sarah-polley-and-other-female-directors-on-the-movies-that-influenced-them/#Wachowski |title=Sam Taylor-Johnson, Lisa Cholodenko, Sarah Polley and Other Female Directors on the Movies That Influenced Them |publisher=The New York Times - T Magazine |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> Both of them are fans of the ''[[Ghost in the Shell (film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Akira (film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Wicked City (1987 film)|Wicked City]]'', ''[[Ninja Scroll]]'' and ''[[Fist of the North Star (1986 film)|Fist of the North Star]]'' [[anime]] films.<ref>''Manga Max'' #8, July 1999</ref>

None of the [[home video]] releases of their films feature any [[deleted scenes]]. Lana says that despite often having to cut scenes from their movies their inclusion in the form of deleted scenes would suggest that their films suffer from incompleteness due to logistical or financial studio constraints, which is not the case as they love the finished product.<ref name="webchat"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/andy-wachowski-lana-wachowski-cloud-atlas-speed-racer-interview/|title=Andy Wachowski, Lana Wachowski, and Tom Tykwer Talk CLOUD ATLAS and SPEED RACER|work=Collider|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref> For the same reason their films never received a [[Director's cut|director's]] or [[Director's cut#Extended cuts and special editions|extended cut]]. They also avoid recording [[audio commentary]] tracks, having participated only once on the track recorded for the [[LaserDisc]] of ''[[Bound (film)|Bound]]''. The siblings explain they discovered offering their interpretation of what their movies mean leads to people being less likely to express their own interpretation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.matrixfans.net/symbolism-philosophy-and-allegory/the-many-meanings-of-the-matrix/|title=The Many Meanings of the Matrix|work=MatrixFans.net|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref><ref>Written Introduction by the Wachowski Brothers included in  ''The Ultimate Matrix Collection''</ref> Furthermore they are also not interested in the typical commentaries with cast and crew reminisces such as about their experiences with the [[catering]].

===Frequent collaborators===
The Wachowskis have been noted for hiring the same basic [[film crew]] to make their movies. Lana admits they do it in part to make sure prejudice does not enter their place of work. "It's like family. Everyone is very respectful of each other." says Lana.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tabach-Bank|first=Lauren|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/female-directors-hollywood-sam-taylor-johnson-jennifer-yuh-nelson-ava-duvernay-sarah-polley-lisa-cholodenko/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=1|title=Flipping the Script|work=The New York Times|date=August 13, 2014}}</ref> They used the same practice while selecting the [[television crew]] for their [[Netflix]] show, ''[[Sense8]]''.

===As film producers and comic book publishers===

Prior to working in the film industry, the Wachowskis wrote comic books for [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Razorline]] imprint, namely  ''[[Ectokid]]'' (created by horror novelist [[Clive Barker]]) in 1993 as well as writing for [[Epic Comics]]' ''[[Hellraiser (comics)|Clive Barker's Hellraiser]]'' and ''[[Nightbreed (comics)|Clive Barker's Nightbreed]]'' comic series.

In 2003, they created [[Burlyman Entertainment]] and have released comic books based on ''The Matrix'' as well as two original bi-monthly series:
* ''[[Shaolin Cowboy]]'' – created, written, and art by [[Geof Darrow]] (the Wachowskis contributed the opening dialogue to each issue)
* ''[[Doc Frankenstein]]'' – created by Geof Darrow and [[Steve Skroce]], written by the Wachowskis, with art by Skroce.

===Lana's gender transition===
Rumors that Lana Wachowski was [[transgender|transitioning]] spread in the early 2000s, though neither sibling spoke directly on the subject at the time.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/may/03/film.features|title=Cut and run|first=Damon|last=Wise|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=May 3, 2008|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}</ref> In 2003 [[Gothamist]].com mentioned the possible gender reassignment and suggested that "the ''Matrix'' films could be read with a sadomasochistic subtext with the news of Larry's companionship with a dominatrix".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://gothamist.com/2003/06/05/sex_change_for_larry_wachowski.php | title=Sex Change for Larry Wachowski? | publisher=gothamist.com | date=June 5, 2003 | accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> Though the Wachowskis remained silent, sources close to them denied the rumors. In a 2007 interview [[Joel Silver]], the producer of numerous Wachowski films, stated that the rumors concerning the gender reassignment surgery were "all untrue", further explaining, "they just don't do interviews, so people make things up." Similar statements were made to Fox News by crew members working on the ''[[Speed Racer (film)|Speed Racer]]'' film, with one employee pointing out, "on the call sheets, it still says Larry."<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,295909,00.html No Sex Change for 'Matrix' Director Larry Wachowski].

In October 2012 Lana received the [[Human Rights Campaign]]'s Visibility Award.<ref name="HRC award speech">{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lana-wachowski-reveals-suicide-plan-382169|title=Lana Wachowski Reveals Suicide Plan, Painful Past in Emotional Speech|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 24, 2012|last=Abramovitch|first=Seth|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref> In her acceptance speech she revealed that she had considered committing suicide once in her youth. Lana's acceptance speech was one of the longest public appearances that either of the notoriously reclusive siblings has ever given. She began by explaining that although she and her brother had not publicly commented on her transitioning during the past decade of rumors about it, this was not because she was ashamed of it, nor had she kept it a secret from her family and friends.  Rather, Lana had not commented about her transitioning due to a general shyness about the news media that both she and her brother Andy possess. Comparing it to losing one's virginity as an event which only happens once and is irreversible, the Wachowskis had tried to stay out of the public eye and avoided giving interviews due to fear of losing their personal privacy, fearing that they would never be able to go to a public restaurant again without being noticed and harassed as celebrities.  Explaining her decision to appear at the event, she said, "there are some things we do for ourselves, but there are some things we do for others. I am here because when I was young, I wanted very badly to be a writer, I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I couldn't find anyone like me in the world and it felt like my dreams were foreclosed simply because my gender was less typical than others.  If I can be that person for someone else, then the sacrifice of my private civic life may have value."<ref name="HRC award speech transcript">{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lana-wachowskis-hrc-visibility-award-382177|title=Lana Wachowski's HRC Visibility Award Acceptance Speech (Transcript)|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref> In February 2014, Lana received the Freedom Award from [[Equality Illinois]] at the organization's annual gala in Chicago. "A native of Chicago’s Beverly neighborhood, Wachowski made her mark in the world of imagination, most famously by writing, directing and executive producing with her brother Andy Wachowski the “The Matrix” trilogy as well as films “Cloud Atlas”, “Bound” and “Speed Racer”."<ref>http://www.equalityillinois.us/2014/01/equality-illinois-honors-chicago-filmmaker-lana-wachowski/</ref><ref>http://chicago.gopride.com/news/article.cfm/articleid/52261729</ref><ref name="EQIL Award Speech">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpqeXgPE03Q</ref>

===Gaming===
Lana and Andy are self-proclaimed [[gamer]]s. As teens they spent their weekends in the attic playing ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''.<ref name="NewYorker"/> They liken the process of the playing parties imagining the same virtual space to the process of filmmaking. Along with some of their friends they wrote a 350-page [[role-playing game]] of their own, called ''High Adventure''.

Asked about their feelings turning the tightly controlled ''Matrix'' saga to the unpredictable form of an [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMORPG]] with ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' the duo appeared enthusiastic about the nature and possibilities of video games:

{{quote box|The "vagaries of an MMO where unpredictable player behavior is the rule," is the reason for doing it. Our films were never intended for a passive audience. There are enough of those kinds of films being made. We wanted our audience to have to work, to have to think, to have to actually participate in order to enjoy them. This may be because while we enjoy movies, we also spend a lot of time (as in crack-den amounts of time) gaming.

Gaming engages your mind actively whereas most genre films (the films we tend to watch) are designed to provoke as little thinking as possible. Consider why the films in which everyone knows exactly what is going to happen are the films that make the most money.

Yet the fact that the Matrix films are three of the most successful adult films in history (despite of what much of the media would have us believe), suggests that there are other people like us. Those are the people, the people who thought about it, who worked at it, who we ultimately made the trilogy for and it now makes perfect sense to us that they should inherit the storyline. For us, the idea of watching our baby evolve inside the virtual bubble-world of this new radically developing medium, which has in our opinion the potential of combining the best attributes of films and games, of synthesizing reality TV with soap opera, RPGs and Mortal Combat {{sic}}, is fantastically exciting.|4=The Wachowskis<ref name="IGN"/>}}
