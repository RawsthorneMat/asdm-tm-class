'''Charlotte Sally Potter''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 19 September 1949) is an English film director and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Potter was born and raised in London. Her mother was a music teacher and her father was an interior designer and a poet.<ref>{{cite news|last=Weinraub|first=Bernard|title=The Talk of Hollywood; How Orlando Finds Her True Self: Filming a Woolfian Escapade|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/movies/talk-hollywood-orlando-finds-her-true-self-filming-woolfian-escapade.html?ref=bernardweinraub|accessdate=30 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 February 1993}}</ref> Her younger brother [[Nic Potter|Nic]] became the bassist for the rock group [[Van der Graaf Generator]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sally-potter | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sally | last=Potter | title=Sally Potter | date=22 January 2013}}</ref> When asked about her background, which influenced her work as a filmmaker, she responds, "I came from an [[atheist]] background and an anarchist background, which meant that I grew up in an environment that was full of questions, where nothing could be taken for granted."<ref name=Fowler />

==Career==
Potter began making amateur films, at age 14, with an 8mm camera given to her by an uncle.<ref>{{cite journal|last=R.T.|title=Introducing 'Orlando' Director: Q&A with Sally Potter|journal=Rolling Stone|date=24 June 1993|issue=659|pages=90|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref> She eventually dropped out of school at age 16 to pursue filmmaking.  From 1968–1970 she worked as a kitchen worker and a picture researcher for BBC in order to support herself and her work. She had joined the [[London Film-Makers' Co-op]] and began making experimental short films, including ''Jerk'' (1969) and ''Play'' (1970). She later trained as a dancer and choreographer at the London School of Contemporary Dance. She made both film and dance pieces, including ''Combines'' (1972), before founding Limited Dance Company with Jacky Lansley.

Potter became an award-winning performance artist and theatre director, with shows including ''Mounting'', ''[[Death and the Maiden (play)|Death and the Maiden]]'' and ''Berlin''. In addition, she was a member of several music bands (including [[Feminist Improvising Group]] and The Film Music Orchestra) working as a lyricist and singer. She collaborated (as a singer-songwriter) with composer [[Lindsay Cooper]] on the song cycle ''[[Oh Moscow]],'' which was performed throughout Europe, Russia and North America in the late 1980s and commercially released.

Potter continued as a composer when she collaborated with David Motion on the soundtrack to ''Orlando.'' She wrote the score for the film, ''[[The Tango Lesson]],'' for which she sang "I am You" in the final scene. Her most recent music work is as producer and co-composer with [[Fred Frith]] of the original tracks for ''Yes'' and ''Rage''.

Referring to her career as a choreographer, Potter said, "Choreography was the perfect 'poor theatre.'  All you needed were willing bodies and some space.  So it was as a choreographer that I learnt how to direct and it was as a dancer that I learnt how to work."<ref name="The Tango Lesson">{{cite book|last=Potter|first=Sally|title=The Tango Lesson|year=1997|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London}}</ref>

Potter returned to filmmaking with her short film ''Thriller'' (1979), which was a hit on the international festival circuit. This was followed by her first feature film, ''The Gold Diggers'' (1983), starring [[Julie Christie]]. She directed another short film, ''The London Story'' (1986); a documentary series for Channel 4, ''Tears'', ''Laughter'', ''Fear and Rage'' (1986); and ''I am an Ox'', ''I am a Horse'', ''I am a Man'', ''I am a Woman'' (1988), a film about women in Soviet cinema.

As director of the internationally distributed ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]'' (1992), Potter received greater appreciation for her writing and direction. Starring [[Tilda Swinton]], the film was based on [[Virginia Woolf]]'s [[Orlando: A Biography|novel by the same name]] and adapted for the screen by Potter. In addition to two Academy Award nominations, ''Orlando'' won more than 25 international awards, including the Felix, awarded by the European Film Academy for the best Young European Film of 1993; and first prizes at [[St Petersburg]], [[Thessaloniki]] and other European festivals.

The novel had previously been considered impossible to adapt for the screen, because it took place over 400 years and followed a character whose sex changes from a man to a woman. Funding the feature proved difficult, and ''Orlando'' took seven years to complete.<ref name=Fowler>{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Catherine|title=Sally Potter|year=2009|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago}}</ref> Filming and editing took 20 weeks.  Preparation for the film, including adapting the novel, funding the film, scouting locations, etc., took four years.<ref name=BOMB>{{cite journal|last=Frilot|first=Shari|title=Sally Potter|journal=BOMB|date=Summer 1993|issue=44|pages=30–35|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40424625|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>

''Orlando'' is often considered a feminist film; however, Potter denies that label.  She said in an interview,<blockquote>"I have come to the conclusion that I can't use that term in my work.  Not because of a disavowal of the underlying principles that gave birth to that word – the commitment to liberation, dignity, equality.  But it has become a trigger word that stops people's thinking.  You literally see people's eyes glaze over with exhaustion when the word flashes into the conversation."<ref name=BOMB /></blockquote>Potter claims that the story shows the difficulties both of being a man and of a being a woman.

She next directed the film, ''[[The Tango Lesson]]'' (1996), in which she also performed with renowned dancer [[Pablo Veron]]. First presented at the [[Venice Film Festival]], the film was awarded the ''Ombú de Oro'' for Best Film at the Mar del Plata Film Festival, Argentina; the SADAIC Great Award from the Sociedad Argentina de Autores y Compositores de Música; as well as receiving Best Film nominations from BAFTA and the US National Board of Review.  ''The Tango Lesson'' is semi-autobiographical, based on Potter's experiences learning Argentinian Tango with Veron while writing the screenplay for ''Rage.''

''The Tango Lesson'' marks Potter's first time performing on screen.  Regarding this decision she stated, "I knew that I had to perform in this one because the impetus for the film came out of my own desire to dance."<ref name="The Tango Lesson" /> Potter's professional collaborations with Pablo Veron continue in ''The Man Who Cried'' and the stage production of ''Carmen'' (2007).

''The Man Who Cried'' (starring [[Johnny Depp]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[John Turturro]]), premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2000.

It was followed by ''Yes'' (2004), with [[Joan Allen]], Simon Abkarian and [[Sam Neill]].  ''Yes'' was written in response to the attacks in the United States of 11 September 2001; it is considered Potter's return to more experimental methods of filmmaking.  The screenplay is written in verse and the film's budget was much smaller than that for ''The Man Who Cried''.  Regarding the film's budget and stylistic approaches, Potter has said,  <blockquote>"Originally I was trying to figure out how we could shoot this film without any lights, because there didn't seem to be enough money in the budget to have any. One solution was to shoot at six frames a second, or even three.  Later you print each frame four (or eight) times to bring it into sync at twenty-four frames per second.  You can shoot almost in the dark, and still see people's faces...we did some tests and found that it was very beautiful; so I decided to make it part of the language of the film."<ref name=Yes>{{cite book|last=Potter|first=Sally|title=Yes: Screenplay and Notes|year=2005|publisher=Newmarket Press|location=New York}}</ref></blockquote>

In 2007 Potter directed [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' for [[English National Opera]] at the London Coliseum, starring [[Alice Coote]] and designed by [[Es Devlin]].

''Rage'' (2009) was the first feature ever to premiere on cell-phones. The cast includes [[Judi Dench]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Lily Cole]] and [[Jude Law]]. ''Rage'' was in competition at the [[Berlin Film Festival]] in 2009 and nominated for a [[WEBBY]] for Best Drama in 2010.

Potter's seventh feature film entitled [[Ginger & Rosa]] was written and directed by Potter and produced by Christoper Sheppard and Andrew Lityin.<ref>{{cite web|last=Corradi|first=Stella|title=It's a Wrap|url=http://sallypotter.com/itsawrap/|accessdate=25 April 2012}}</ref> The film starred [[Elle Fanning]] and [[Alice Englert]] as the titular characters and received its premiere at the [[Telluride Film Festival]].<ref name="imdb">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2115295/releaseinfo</ref> The film went into limited release in the UK in 2012 before enjoying a limited run in North America in early 2013.<ref name="imdb" />
