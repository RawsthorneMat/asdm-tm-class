'''George Francis "Gabby" Hayes''' (May 7, 1885&nbsp;– February 9, 1969) was an American radio, film, and television [[actor]]. He was best known for his numerous appearances in [[Western (genre)|Western]] films as the colorful sidekick to the leading man.

==Early years==
Hayes was born the third of seven children in his father's hotel in [[Stannards, New York]], a hamlet just outside [[Wellsville, New York]]. (Hayes always gave Wellsville as his birthplace, but legally he was born in Stannards).<ref>Wellsville Daily Reporter, 17 September 1966</ref><ref name="alleganycohist">{{Cite web | url =http://www.alleganycountynylocalhistory.com/TownVillageReservation/TownWilling/TownWilling%20Photo%20Gallery/WillingPhotoGallery.htm | title=Photo Gallery-Town of Willing,NY Page 1 | accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref> He was the son of Elizabeth Morrison and Clark Hayes, and the nephew of [[George F. Morrison]], vice president of [[General Electric]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Hayes did not come from a cowboy background; in fact, he did not know how to ride a horse until he was in his forties and had to learn for film roles. His father, Clark Hayes, operated the Hayes Hotel in Stannards and was also involved in oil production. George Hayes grew up in Stannards and attended Stannards School.<ref name="alleganycohist" />  He played semi-professional [[baseball]] while in high school, then ran away from home in 1902, at 17. He joined a stock company, apparently traveled for a time with a circus, and became a successful vaudevillian. Hayes married Olive E. Ireland, daughter of a [[New Jersey]] glass finisher, on March 4, 1914. She joined him in vaudeville, performing under the name Dorothy Earle (not to be confused with film actress/writer Dorothy Earle). Hayes had become so successful that by 1928 he was able, at age 43, to retire to a home on [[Long Island]] in [[Baldwin, Nassau County, New York|Baldwin, New York]]. He lost all his savings the next year in the 1929 stock-market crash. Dorothy Earle convinced Hayes to try his luck in films, and the couple moved to Los Angeles. They remained together until her death on July 5, 1957. The couple had no children.

==Film career==
On his move to Los Angeles, according to later interviews, Hayes had a chance meeting with producer Trem Carr, who liked his look and gave him 30 roles over the next six years. In his early career, Hayes was cast in a variety of roles, including villains, and occasionally played two roles in a single film. He found a niche in the growing genre of Western films, many of which were series with recurring characters. Ironically, Hayes would admit he had never been a big fan of Westerns.

Hayes, in real life an intelligent, well groomed and articulate man, was cast as a grizzled codger who uttered phrases such as "consarn it", "yer durn tootin'", "dadgummit", "durn persnickety female", and "young whippersnapper."

From 1935 to 1939, Hayes played the part of Windy Halliday, the sidekick to [[Hopalong Cassidy]] ([[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]]). In 1939, Hayes left [[Paramount Pictures]] in a dispute over his salary and moved to [[Republic Pictures]]. Paramount held the rights to the name Windy Halliday, so a new nickname was created for Hayes' character, Gabby. As Gabby Whitaker, Hayes appeared in more than 40 films between 1939 and 1946, usually with [[Roy Rogers]], but also with [[Gene Autry]] or [[Wild Bill Elliott]], often working under the directorship of [[Joseph Kane]].

Hayes was also repeatedly cast as a sidekick to western icons [[Randolph Scott]] (six times) and [[John Wayne]] (15 times, some as straight or villainous characters). Hayes played Wayne's sidekick in [[Raoul Walsh]]'s ''[[Dark Command]]'' (1940), which featured Roy Rogers in a supporting role. Hayes became a popular performer and consistently appeared among the 10 favorite actors in polls taken of movie-goers of the period. He appeared in either one or both the ''Motion Picture Herald'' and ''Boxoffice Magazine'' lists of Top Ten Money-making Western Stars for 12 straight years and a 13th time in 1954, four years after his last film.

The Western film genre declined in the late 1940s and Hayes made his last film appearance in ''[[The Cariboo Trail]]'' (1950). He moved to [[television]] and hosted ''[[The Gabby Hayes Show]]'', a western series, from 1950 to 1954 on [[NBC]], and a new version in 1956 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. He introduced the show, often while whittling on a piece of wood, and would sometimes throw in some tall stories. Halfway through the show, he would say something else, and at the end of the show, also, but he did not appear as an active character in the stories themselves. When the series ended, Hayes retired from show business. He lent his name to a [[comic book]] series and to a children's summer camp in New York.

==Death==
Following his wife's death on July 5, 1957, he lived in and managed a 10-unit [[apartment]] building he owned in [[North Hollywood, California]]. In early 1969, he entered Saint Joseph Hospital in [[Burbank, California]], for treatment of [[cardiovascular disease]]. He died there on February 9, 1969, at the age of 83. George "Gabby" Hayes was interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn – Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]].

==Honors==
For his contribution to radio, Gabby Hayes has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6427 Hollywood Boulevard, and a second star at 1724 Vine Street for his contribution to the television industry. In 2000, he was posthumously inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].

==Popular culture==
Homage was paid to Hayes in a different way in the 1974 satirical western ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''. A lookalike actor named [[Jack Starrett|Claude Ennis Starrett, Jr.]] played a Gabby Hayes-like character. In keeping with one running joke in the movie, the character was called Gabby ''Johnson''. After he delivered a rousing, though largely unintelligible speech to the townspeople, [[David Huddleston]]'s character proclaimed, "Now, who can argue with ''that''?!" and proclaimed it as "authentic frontier [[gibberish]]."<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke5Mr5eCF2U "Authentic Frontier Gibberish" scene at youtube]</ref>

Hayes inspired ''Doppio Rhum'' character in [[Captain Miki]], an Italian comic series.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Hayes has also been portrayed in impressions by [[Fred LaBour]] (Too Slim), during [[Riders in the Sky (band)|Riders in the Sky]] performances.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

During a Mighty Carson Art Players sketch on ''The Tonight Show'', [[Johnny Carson]] impersonated Gabby Hayes in the sketch with guest star [[Roy Rogers]]. This sketch has appeared on Carson's syndicated ''[[Carson's Comedy Classics]]'' series that features highlights from his years as ''The Tonight Show'' host.

Gabby was mentioned in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man]]", where Milhouse becomes Radioactive Man's sidekick, "[[Fallout Boy (The Simpsons)|Fallout Boy]]"; the producer of the film comments that Milhouse is "going to be big, Gabby Hayes big!"{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Every year in April at the beginning of trout season in [[Pennsylvania]], the Gabby Hayes Memorial Fishing Expedition is held by a group of long-time friends and is so named in whimsical homage to the man whose early career began in the environs of his boyhood New York home near the northern Pennsylvania border. The first "expedition" was held in 1969, coincidentally the year of Hayes' death.<ref>[http://www.gabbyhayes.net/ Gabbyhayes.net]</ref>

Every year in early July, from 1983 through 1989, "Gabby Hayes Days" were celebrated in Wellsville, New York. The event featured a street sale, square dancing, and Gabby Hayes look-alike contests for adults and children. This celebration was eventually merged into the mid-July Wellsville Balloon Rally and gradually disappeared. A street is also named after him in Wellsville, Gabby Hayes Lane.<ref name="alleganycohist" /><ref>[http://www.wellsvilleballoonrally.com/History/history.html/ Wellsvilleballoonrally.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyallega/wellsville.html Ancestry.com]</ref>

The famous Manhattan restaurant Danny's Hideaway at 151 East 45th Street called one of its main dining areas the Gabby Hayes Room, in honor of the friendship between owner Dante "Danny" Stradella and Hayes.<ref>[http://www.purecowboy.us/Western%20Star%20Gabby%20Hayes%20and%20Danny%27s%20Hideaway.htm Purecowboy.us]</ref>
