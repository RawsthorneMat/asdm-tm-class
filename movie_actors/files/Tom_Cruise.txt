Cruise also played the male lead (Jack O' the Green) in ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' (released 1986).

[[File:Tom cruise 1989.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cruise at the [[61st Academy Awards]] in 1989]]

Cruise followed up ''Top Gun'' with ''[[The Color of Money]]'', which came out the same year, and which paired him with  [[Paul Newman]]. 1988 saw him star in ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'', which earned him a nomination for the [[Razzie Award for Worst Actor]].

The film was well received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as [[Julian Sands]] was her first choice. Upon seeing the film however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305073,00.html Go Figure], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', December 30, 1994.</ref>

In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy [[Ethan Hunt]] in the reboot of ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]],'' which he produced.

Wells]] [[The War of the Worlds|novel of the same name]], which became the fourth highest grossing film of the year with US$591.4&nbsp;million worldwide.

===Producing===
Cruise partnered with his former talent agent [[Paula Wagner]] to form [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]] in 1993,<ref name="MGM">{{cite news |title=MGM Partners With Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner to Form New United Artists |url=http://sev.prnewswire.com/entertainment/20061102/LATH10602112006-1.html |agency=PR Newswire |publisher=Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios |date=November 2, 2006 |quote= |archiveurl=http://www.unitedartists.com/popups/pr/release_08.html |archivedate=November 16, 2007}}</ref> and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a producer.

Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist [[Edward Jay Epstein]] as "one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood." Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being [[George Lucas]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.<ref name="Epstein">{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|authorlink=Edward Jay Epstein|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2121617/ |title=Tom Cruise Inc. – By Edward Jay Epstein – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=October 31, 2008}}</ref>

H. Holmes]], at [[Chicago]]'s [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. [[Kathryn Bigelow]] is attached to the project to produce and helm.

====Breakup with Paramount====
On August 22, 2006, [[Paramount Pictures]] announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise.

====Management of United Artists====
In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over [[United Artists]] film studio.<ref name="MGM"/> Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA's chief executive. Production began in 2007 of ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'', a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against [[Adolf Hitler]]. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007 Cruise signed on to play [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], the [[protagonist]]. This project marks the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'', directed by [[Robert Redford]] and starring Redford, [[Meryl Streep]] and Cruise. ''Lambs'' was released on November 9, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/21/73153.shtml?s=en |title=Tom Cruise Takes on Adolf Hitler |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=March 21, 2007 |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}</ref> opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.
