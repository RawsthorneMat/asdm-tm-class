==Early life==
Lewis Gilbert was born in in [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], London, the son of a second-generation family of [[music hall]] performers,<ref name="BFI_biography">[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/829716/index.html "Lewis Gilbert (1920)"], BFI screenonline Retrieved 14 April 2012</ref> and spent his early years travelling with his parents, and watching the shows from the wings. He first performed on-stage at the age of 5, when asked to drive a trick car around the stage. This pleased the audience, so this became the end of his parents' act. When travelling on trains, his parents frequently hid him in the luggage rack, to avoid paying a fare for him. His father contracted [[tuberculosis]] when he was a young man. He died aged 34, when Gilbert was seven. As a child actor in films in the 1920s and 1930s, he was the breadwinner for his family, his mother was a film extra, and he had an erratic formal education. In 1933, at the age of 13, he had a role in [[Victor Hanbury]] and [[John Stafford (producer)|John Stafford]]'s ''[[Dick Turpin (1933 film)|Dick Turpin]]'', and at age 17 a small uncredited role in ''[[The Divorce of Lady X]]'' (1938) opposite [[Laurence Olivier]]. [[Alexander Korda]] offered to send him to [[RADA]], but Gilbert chose to study direction instead, notably as an assistant on [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Jamaica Inn (film)|Jamaica Inn]]'' (1939).<ref name="BFI_biography"/>

When the [[Second World War]] started, he joined the [[Royal Air Force]]'s film unit, where he worked on various documentary films. He was eventually seconded to the US Air Corp film unit, where his commanding officer was [[William Keighley]], an American film director, who allowed Gilbert to take on much of his film-making work.

==Directorial career==
After the war, he continued to write and direct documentary shorts for [[Gaumont British]], before entering low budget feature film production.<ref name="BFI_biography"/> Gilbert made his name as a director in the 1950s and 1960s with a series of successful films, often working as the film's writer and producer as well. These films were often based on true stories from the Second World War. Examples include ''[[Reach for the Sky]]'' (1956) (based on the life of air ace [[Douglas Bader]]), ''[[Carve Her Name with Pride]]'' (1958) (the story of [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] agent [[Violette Szabo]]) and ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' (1960).<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07E5D7173DE333A25751C1A9649C946191D6CF New York Times February 12, 1960: Movie Review Sink the Bismarck! (1960)]</ref>

===''Alfie''===
In 1966 Gilbert directed ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]''<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/1446/Alfie/overview The New York Times]</ref> starring [[Michael Caine]]. Gilbert's wife Hylda discovered the play by [[Bill Naughton]] when she visited the hair salon and sat next to an actress who was in a production. Upon seeing the play, Hylda urged Gilbert to make it into a film. Gilbert used the technique of having the lead character speak directly to the viewer, a technique he later also used in ''[[Shirley Valentine (film)|Shirley Valentine]]'' (1989). Gilbert said ''Alfie'' was only made because the low budget was "the sort of money Paramount executives normally spend on cigar bills".<ref>''Halliwell's Film & Video Guide 2000'', 1999, London: HarperCollins, p15</ref> The film won the Jury Special Prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]] including best picture.<ref>[http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/39th-winners.html Oscars.org]</ref> Gilbert was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] for best director. The film was remade in 2004 with [[Jude Law]].<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/2004/11/05/movies/05alfi.html?scp=2&sq=alfie&st=cse The New York Times]</ref>

In 1967, Gilbert was chosen to direct [[Lionel Bart]]'s musical of ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' but contracted to another project had to pull out and recommended [[Carol Reed]] who took over.<ref name="BFI_biography"/>

===James Bond===
Although known for character dramas, Gilbert directed three of the [[James Bond]] films. After some reluctance, he was persuaded by [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]] to direct ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967).<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C07E5DE173FE53BBC4C52DFB066838C679EDE The New York Times]</ref><ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670619/REVIEWS/706190301/1023 Chicago Sun-Times]</ref> Gilbert returned to the series in the 1970s to make ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977)<ref name=NYT/> and ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979).<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E07E6DA143EE732A2575AC2A9609C946890D6CF The New York Times]</ref>

===Later career===
In the 1980s he returned to more small-scale dramas with film versions of [[Willy Russell]]'s plays ''[[Educating Rita (film)|Educating Rita]]'' (1983)<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F00E3D71138F932A1575AC0A965948260 The New York Times]</ref> and ''[[Shirley Valentine]]'' (1989).<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE7D61F3AF933A0575BC0A96F948260 The New York Times]</ref><ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19890915/REVIEWS/909150303/1023 Chicago-Sun Times]</ref> Gilbert also directed the film ''[[Stepping Out (1991 film)|Stepping Out]]'' (1991).<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CE5DC113CF937A35753C1A967958260 The New York Times]</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-10-03/entertainment/ca-4608_1_shirley-valentine The Los Angeles Times]</ref>

He was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1997. In 2001, Lewis Gilbert was made a [[British Film Institute Fellowship|Fellow of the British Film Institute]], the highest accolade given in the British film industry.<ref name="BFI_biography"/>

On 20 June 2010 he appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. In it he said of ''[[The Adventurers (1970 film)|The Adventurers]]'', that the film was a disaster, and that he should never have made it. Of working with [[Orson Welles]] on ''[[Ferry to Hong Kong]]'', he said that it was: "dreadful, it was my nightmare film. It was a dreadful film, and everything was wrong with it; principally him [Welles]." He also said that his biggest mistake was failing to direct the film version of the musical ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]''. Its composer [[Lionel Bart]] had assured Gilbert that nobody else would do the film, but Gilbert was also contractually committed to Paramount to make a film (that he has since refused to name), which caused him to withdraw from the project.

==Personal life==
He was married to the former Hylda Tafler for 53 years, until her death in June 2005; they had two sons, John by a previous relationship of Hylda, and Stephen who was fathered by Lewis.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2010/jan/20/gillian-gore-obituary The Guardian]</ref> 

''All My Flashbacks: The Autobiography of Lewis Gilbert Sixty Years a Film Director'' was published by Reynolds & Hearn in 2010.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rfl5w "The Film Programme"], BBC Radio 4, 26 March 2010</ref>
