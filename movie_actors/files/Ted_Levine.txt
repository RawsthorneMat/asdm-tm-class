==Mainstream success==
After his breakout role in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (as primary antagonist [[Buffalo Bill (character)|Buffalo Bill]]), there was a period where he was typecast in villainous roles. Levine was able to remedy this by playing more positive characters, such as a member of [[Al Pacino]]'s police unit in ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'', astronaut [[Alan Shepard]] in the [[HBO]] mini-series ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'', and [[Paul Walker]]'s police superior Sergeant Tanner in ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]''. In the drama ''[[Georgia (1995 film)|Georgia]]'', he played [[Mare Winningham]]'s husband, one of his most sympathetic roles. His résumé also includes an uncredited role as the voice of the sociopathic trucker "Rusty Nail" in 2001's ''[[Joy Ride (2001 film)|Joy Ride]]'', and his performance as Detective Sam Nico in the 2003 film ''[[Wonderland (2003 film)|Wonderland]]'', based on the [[Wonderland murders|gruesome murders]] in the Hollywood Hills. From 2002 to 2009, he co-starred as Captain Leland Stottlemeyer on [[USA Network]]'s detective series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', starring [[Tony Shalhoub]].

Levine provided the voice of the supervillain [[Sinestro]] in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', ''[[Static Shock]]'', ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'', and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. Levine also appeared as a patriarch whose family takes a turn for the worse in the remake of ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (2006). In 2007, he portrayed local Sheriff [[James Timberlake]] in ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' and appeared in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'', alongside [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Russell Crowe]]. In 2010, he appeared as the warden of the island prison in ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'', starring Leonardo DiCaprio. In 2012, he appeared as Sheriff Bloom Towne in ''[[Deep Dark Canyon]]'', alongside [[Spencer Treat Clark]] and [[Nick Eversman]], who portray Sheriff Towne's sons, Nate and Skylar, respectively.  In 2013, he had a major supporting role in the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] murder mystery series ''[[The Bridge (2013 TV series)|The Bridge]]'' as Lieutenant Hank Wade, commander of a police homicide unit in a Texas border city.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bridge's Ted Levine: "The Killer Is More Hannibal Lecter Than Jame Gumb"|url=http://www.littlefallstimes.com/article/20130814/NEWS/308149986|work=littlefallstimes.com|accessdate=23 August 2013|author=TV Guide|date=August 14, 2013}}</ref> In 2014 he portrayed General Underwood in the British-Finnish action film [[Big Game (2014 film)|Big Game]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Big Game|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/videos/3334780/big-game-hunts-u-s-audiences-trailer/|work=littlefallstimes.com|accessdate=23 August 2013|author=TV Guide|date=August 14, 2013}}</ref>
