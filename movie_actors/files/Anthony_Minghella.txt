'''Anthony Minghella''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (6 January 1954{{spaced ndash}}18 March 2008) was a British film director, playwright and screenwriter. He was chairman of the board of Governors at the [[British Film Institute]] between 2003 and 2007.

He won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (1996).

==Early life==
Minghella was born in [[Ryde]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], an island off the south coast of England that is a popular holiday resort. His family are well-known on the island, where they have run an eponymous business making and selling [[Gelato|Italian-style]] [[ice cream]] since the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet the Minghellas|url=http://www.minghella.co.uk/meettheminghellas.php|publisher=Minghellas|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> His parents were Edward Minghella (an Italian immigrant) and Leeds-born Gloria Alberta (née Arcari). His mother's ancestors originally came from [[Valvori]], a small village in the [[Lazio]] region of central Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/67/Anthony-Minghella.html|title=Anthony Minghella bio|accessdate=7 July 2009|publisher=Filmreference.com}}</ref><ref name=oxfr1>http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/100058 {{Subscription required}}<br />{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/movies/14brea.html|work=The New York Times|first=Sarah|last=Lyall|title=In the Spotlight, Two Sides of London|date=14 December 2006}}.</ref>

==Career==
His debut work was a stage adaptation of [[Gabriel Josipovici]]'s ''Mobius the Stripper'' (1975) and it was his ''Whale Music'' (1985) brought him notice.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Anthony_Minghella/190042 | title = Anthony Minghella at Hollywood.com | accessdate = 7 July 2009 | publisher = Hollywood.com}}</ref> His double bill of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''Play'' and ''Happy Days'' was his directorial debut and debut feature film as a director was ''[[A Little Like Drowning]]'' (1978). During the 1980s, he worked in television, starting as a runner on ''[[Magpie (TV series)|Magpie]]'' before moving into [[script editor|script editing]] the children's drama series ''[[Grange Hill]]'' for the [[BBC]] and later writing ''[[The Storyteller]]'' series for [[Jim Henson]]. He wrote several episodes of the [[ITV Network|ITV]] detective drama ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' and an episode of long-running ITV drama ''[[Boon (TV series)|Boon]]''. ''[[Made in Bangkok]]'' (1986) found mainstream success in the West End.

Radio success followed with a [[Giles Cooper Awards|Giles Cooper Award]] for the radio drama ''Cigarettes and Chocolate''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00b62ff | title = BBC – BBC Radio 4 Programmes – Saturday Play, Cigarettes and Chocolate | accessdate = 7 July 2009 | publisher = [[BBC News]]}} {{Dead link|date=July 2009}}</ref> first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1988. It was revived on 3 May 2008 as a tribute to its author director following his death. His production starred [[Juliet Stevenson]], [[Bill Nighy]] and Jenny Howe. His first radio play ''Hang Up'', starring [[Anton Lesser]] and Juliet Stevenson, was revived on 10 May 2008 as part of the BBC Radio 4 Minghella season.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/20523/bbc-radio-to-air-minghella-play-season | title = BBC radio to air Minghella play season | date = 25 April 2008 | accessdate = 7 July 2009 | work = [[The Stage]] | last = Hemley | first = Matthew}}</ref>

''[[Truly, Madly, Deeply]]'' (1990), a feature drama written and directed for the BBC's ''[[Screen Two]]'' anthology strand, bypassed TV broadcast and instead had a cinema release. He bypassed an offer of another ''[[Inspector Morse]]'' directorial to do the project, the later he believed would have been a much higher-profile assignment. With ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'' (1996; director) started his [[Academy Awards]] winning accomplishments, including:  ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' (1999; the [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Academy Award for Adapted Screenplay]]).

''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (TV series)|The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]]'', a pilot episode television adaptation which he co-wrote and directed, was broadcast posthumously on [[BBC One]] (23 March 2008); watched by 6.3 million viewers. He vocally supported ''I Know I'm Not Alone'', a film of musician [[Michael Franti]]'s peacemaking excursions into [[Iraq]], [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] and [[Israel]]. He directed a [[party election broadcast]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2005. The short film depicted [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] working together and was criticised for being insincere: "The Anthony Minghella party political broadcast last year was full of body language fibs", said Peter Collett, a psychologist at the [[University of Oxford]]. "When you are talking to me, I'll give you my full attention only if I think you are very high status or if I love you. On that party political broadcast, they are staring at each other like lovers. It is completely false."<ref>{{cite news | last = Henderson | first = Mark | title = The science behind their mutual dislike | work = The Times Online | publisher = | date = 6 September 2006 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article629340.ece | accessdate = 18 March 2008|location=London}}</ref>

With Samuel Beckett's 100th birthday celebrations, he returned to radio on [[BBC Radio 3]] with ''Eyes Down Looking'' (2006), with: [[Jude Law]], Juliet Stevenson and [[David Threlfall]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/theverb/pip/rvilt/ | title = BBC – Radio 3 – The Verb – Beckett centenary | date = 1 April 2006 | accessdate = 7 July 2009 | work = BBC | last = Koek | first = Ariane}}</ref>An operatic directorial debut came with [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. Premiered at the [[English National Opera]] (London, 2005), then at the [[Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] (Vilnius, March 2006) and at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] (New York City, September 2006). The latter was transmitted live into cinemas worldwide (7 March 2008) as part of the [[Metropolitan Opera Live in HD|Met's HD series]] and is now available on DVD. His was honoured with the naming of The Anthony Minghella Theatre at the [[The Quay Arts|Quay Arts Centre]] ([[Isle of Wight]]). He made an appearance in ''[[Atonement (film)|Atonement]]'' (film, 2007), as a television host interviewing the novelist central to the story.

His last work was the screenplay of [[Nine (2009 live-action film)|the film adaptation of]] the Tony Award-winning musical ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'' (1982); [[Arthur Kopit]] (book) and [[Maury Yeston]] (score). It is based on the film ''[[8½]]''. He shared credit with [[Michael Tolkin]] on the screenplay.
