==Early life==
McQueen was born '''Terence Steven McQueen'''<ref name="terrillx1x"/> on March 24, 1930 in [[Beech Grove, Indiana]]. His father, William Terence McQueen, a [[stunt pilot]] for a [[Barnstorming|barnstorming flying circus]], abandoned McQueen's mother six months after meeting her.<ref name="terrillx1x"/> His mother, Julia Ann ([[married and maiden names|née]] Crawford), was allegedly an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] and sometime prostitute.<ref name="Eliot">[[Editing Marc Eliot (author)|Marc Eliot]] ''Steve McQueen: A Biography'' [[Crown Publishing Group]] 2011; ISBN 978-0-307-45323-5</ref><ref>Nolan, William F.

Unable to cope with caring for a small child, she left him with her parents (Victor and Lillian) in [[Slater, Missouri]], in 1933. Shortly thereafter, as the [[Great Depression]] set in, McQueen and his grandparents moved in with Lillian's brother Claude, at his farm in Slater.<ref name="terrillx1x"/> McQueen was raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Mackay|first=Kathy|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20077667,00.html|title=Steve McQueen, Stricken with Cancer, Seeks a Cure at a Controversial Mexican Clinic|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|quote=Raised as a Catholic, he now feels he has, according to one friend, 'made his peace with God.'|date=1980-10-20|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Leith|first=William|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200111260047|title=Easy rider|work=[[New Statesman]]|quote = Steve knew what it was like to be dyslexic, deaf, illegitimate, backward, beaten, abused, deserted and raised Catholic in a Protestant heartland.|date=2001-11-26|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref>

He had good memories of the times on his Uncle Claude's farm. In recalling him, McQueen stated:  "He was a very good man, very strong, very fair. I learned a lot from him."<ref name="terrillx1x"/> On McQueen's fourth birthday, Claude gave him a red [[tricycle]], which McQueen later said started his interest in racing.<ref name="terrillx1x"/> At age 8, he was taken home by his mother and lived with her and her new husband in [[Indianapolis]]. McQueen retained a special memory of leaving the farm: "The day I left the farm Uncle Claude gave me a personal going-away present; a gold pocket watch, with an inscription inside the case." The inscription read: "To Steve&nbsp;– who has been a son to me."<ref name="William F. Nolan">{{cite book|last=Nolan|first=William|authorlink=William F. Nolan|title=McQueen|publisher=Congdon & Weed Inc.|year=1984|isbn=0-312-92526-3}}</ref>

McQueen, who was [[dyslexic]] and partially deaf due to a childhood [[ear infection]],<ref name="terrillx1x"/> did not adjust well to his new life. His new step-father beat him so badly that at the age of nine McQueen left home to live on the streets.<ref name="Eliot"/> Not long after he was running with a street gang and committing acts of [[petty crime]].<ref name="terrillx1x"/> Unable to control McQueen's behavior, his mother sent him back to Slater. When McQueen was 12, Julia wrote to Claude asking that McQueen be returned to her again, to live in her new home in [[Los Angeles, California]]. Julia, whose second marriage had ended in divorce, had married a third time.

By McQueen's own account, he and his new stepfather, "locked horns immediately."<ref name="terrillx1x"/> McQueen recalls him being "A prime son of a bitch" who was not averse to using his fists on McQueen and his mother.<ref name="terrillx1x"/> As McQueen began to rebel again, he was sent back to live with Claude a final time. At age 14, McQueen left Claude's farm without saying goodbye and joined a circus for a short time,<ref name="terrillx1x"/> then drifted back to his mother and stepfather in Los Angeles, resuming his life as a gang member and petty criminal. McQueen was caught stealing hubcaps by police, who handed him over to his stepfather who beat him severely, ending the fight by throwing McQueen down a flight of stairs. McQueen looked up at his stepfather and said, "You lay your stinkin' hands on me again and I swear, I'll kill ya."<ref name="terrillx1x"/>

After the incident, McQueen's stepfather convinced his mother to sign a court order stating that McQueen was incorrigible, remanding him to the California Junior [[Boys Republic]] in [[Chino, California]].<ref name="terrillx1x"/> Here, McQueen  began to change and mature. He was not popular with the other boys at first: "Say the boys had a chance once a month to load into a bus and go into town to see a movie. And they lost out because one guy in the bungalow didn't get his work done right. Well, you can pretty well guess they're gonna have something to say about that. I paid my dues with the other fellows quite a few times. I got my lumps, no doubt about it. The other guys in the bungalow had ways of paying you back for interfering with their well-being."<ref name="McCoy">{{cite book | last=McCoy | first=Malachy | title=Steve McQueen, The Unauthorized Biography | publisher=Signet Books | year=1975 | isbn=0-352-39811-6}}</ref>  
Ultimately, McQueen became a role model when he was elected to the Boys Council, a group who set the rules and regulations governing the boys' lives.<ref name="terrillx1x"/> He eventually left Boys Republic at 16. When he later became famous, he regularly returned to talk to the boys and retained a lifelong association.

At 16, McQueen left Chino and returned to his mother, now living in [[Greenwich Village]]. He then met two sailors from the [[Merchant Marine]] and volunteered to serve on a ship bound for the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref name="terrillx1x" /> Once there, he abandoned his new post, eventually being employed as a "towel boy" in a [[brothel]].<ref name="Eliot" /> Afterwards, McQueen made his way to [[Texas]], and drifted from job to job.  He worked as an oil rigger, a trinket salesman in a carnival, and a [[lumberjack]].

===Military service===
In 1947, McQueen joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] and was promoted to [[private first class]] and assigned to an armored unit.<ref name="terrillx1x"/> At first, he reverted to his prior rebelliousness, and was demoted to private seven times. He took an unauthorized absence by failing to return after a weekend pass expired, staying with a girlfriend for two weeks until the [[shore patrol]] caught him. He resisted arrest and spent 41 days in the [[military prison|brig]].<ref name="terrillx1x"/> After this, McQueen resolved to focus his energies on [[self-improvement]] and embraced the Marines' [[discipline]]. He saved the lives of five other Marines during an Arctic exercise, pulling them from a tank before it broke through ice into the sea.<ref name="terrillx1x"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Enk |first=Bryan |title=Real Life Tough Guys |url=http://movies.yahoo.com/photos/real-life-tough-guys-1374864278-slideshow/afi-life-achievement-award-a-tribute-to-mel-brooks-awards-presentation-photo-1374864255359.html|publisher=Yahoo.com|accessdate=27 July 2013}}</ref> He was assigned to the honor guard, responsible for guarding then [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Harry Truman]]'s yacht.<ref name="terrillx1x"/> McQueen served until 1950 when he was [[honorable discharge|honorably discharged]].

==Acting==

===The 1950s===
[[File:Steve McQueen - The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery (1959) - 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Steve McQueen in ''[[The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery]]'']]
In 1952, with financial assistance provided by the [[G.I. Bill]], McQueen began studying acting at [[Sanford Meisner]]'s Neighborhood Playhouse.<ref name="terrillx1x"/>  Purportedly, the future "king of cool" delivered his first dialogue on a theatre stage in a 1952 play produced by [[Yiddish theatre]] star [[Molly Picon]]. McQueen's character spoke one brief line: "''Alts iz farloyrn''." ("''All is lost.''").<ref>Karlen, Neal, "The Story of Yiddish: How a Mish-Mosh of Languages Saved the Jews," William Morrow, 2008, ISBN 006083711X</ref>  He began to earn money by competing in weekend motorcycle races at Long Island City Raceway and purchased the first of many motorcycles, a [[Harley-Davidson]]. He soon became an excellent racer, and went home each weekend with about $100 in winnings ($879 in 2014 dollars adjusted for inflation).<ref name="terrillx1x"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm |title=BLS.gov |publisher=BLS.gov |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref> He appeared as a musical judge in an episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Jukebox Jury]]'', that aired in the 1953–1954 season.<ref>''Jukebox Jury'': Research Video, Inc.: Music Footing Licensing Agency and Vintage Television Footage Archive</ref>

McQueen had minor roles in productions including ''Peg o' My Heart'', ''[[The Member of the Wedding]]'', and ''Two Fingers of Pride''. He made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1955 in the play ''[[A Hatful of Rain]]'', starring [[Ben Gazzara]].<ref name="terrillx1x"/>

In late 1955, at the age of 25, McQueen left New York and headed for California, where he moved into a house on Vestal Avenue in the [[Echo Park, California|Echo Park]] area, seeking acting jobs in Hollywood.<ref name=oll>{{cite web|title=Our Lady of Loretto Elementary School: Local History Timeline|url=http://www.ollalumni.com/local-history.php|accessdate=2011-06-23}}</ref>  When McQueen appeared in a two-part television presentation entitled ''The Defenders'', Hollywood manager [[Hillard Elkins|Hilly Elkins]] (who managed McQueen's first wife, Neile) took note of him<ref name="neile">{{cite book | last=McQueen Toffel | first=Neile | authorlink = Neile Adams| title=My Husband, My Friend | publisher=Signet Books | year=2006 | isbn=1-4259-1818-2}}</ref> and decided that [[B-movie]]s would be a good place for the young actor to make his mark. He landed his first film role in a bit part in ''[[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]]'', directed by [[Robert Wise]] and starring [[Paul Newman]]. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films ''[[Never Love a Stranger]]'', ''[[The Blob]]'' (his first leading role), and ''[[The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery]]''.

McQueen's first breakout role came on television. He appeared on [[Dale Robertson]]'s [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]''. Elkins, then McQueen's manager,  successfully lobbied [[Vincent M. Fennelly]] ([[:fr:Vincent M. Fennelly|fr]]), producer of the western series ''[[Trackdown (TV series)|Trackdown]]'', to have McQueen read for the part of [[bounty hunter]] Josh Randall in a  ''Trackdown'' episode. McQueen appeared as Randall in the episode, cast opposite series lead and old New York motorcycle racing buddy [[Robert Culp]]. McQueen then filmed the pilot episode, which became the series titled ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', which aired on [[CBS]] in September 1958.

===The 1960s===
[[File:Steve McQueen Virginia Gregg Wanted Dead or Alive 1959.JPG|thumb|McQueen with [[Virginia Gregg]] in ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', 1959]]
In the interviews in the DVD release of ''Wanted'', ''Trackdown'''s star Robert Culp claims credit for bringing McQueen to Hollywood and landing him the part of Randall. He said he taught McQueen the "art of the fast-draw", adding that, on the second day of filming, McQueen beat him. McQueen became a household name as a result of this series.<ref name="terrillx1x"/> Randall's special holster held a sawed-off .44-40 [[Winchester rifle]] nicknamed the "[[Mare's Leg]]" instead of the [[Six Gun|six-gun]] carried by the typical Western character, although the cartridges in the gunbelt were dummy .45-70, chosen because they "looked tougher". Coupled with the generally negative image of the bounty hunter (noted in the three-part DVD special on the background of the series) this added to the [[anti-hero]] image infused with mystery and detachment that made this show stand out from the typical TV Western. The 94 episodes that ran from 1958 until early 1961 kept McQueen steadily employed, and he became a fixture at the renowned [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth, Calif.]], where much of the outdoor action for ''Wanted: Dead or Alive'' was shot. Known for its huge sandstone boulders and widely recognized as the most heavily filmed outdoor shooting location in the history of the movies and television, the movie ranch helped give a rugged, authentically Western look to the series.

At 29, McQueen got a significant break when [[Frank Sinatra]] removed [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], from the film ''[[Never So Few]]'' after Davis supposedly made some mildly negative remarks about Sinatra in a radio interview, and Davis' role went to McQueen. Sinatra saw something special in McQueen and ensured that the young actor got plenty of closeups in a role that earned McQueen favorable reviews. McQueen's character, Bill Ringa, was never more comfortable than when driving at high speed—in this case in a [[jeep]]—or handling a switchblade or a [[tommy gun]].

After ''Never So Few'', the film's director [[John Sturges]] cast McQueen in his next movie, promising to "give him the camera". ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' (1960), in which he played Vin Tanner and co-starred with [[Yul Brynner]], [[Robert Vaughn]], [[Charles Bronson]] and [[James Coburn]], became McQueen's first major hit and led to his withdrawal from ''Wanted: Dead or Alive''. McQueen's focused portrayal of the taciturn second lead catapulted his career. His added touches in each scene, such as shaking a shotgun round before loading it and wiping his hat rim, annoying costar Brynner, who protested that McQueen was trying to steal his spotlight.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} (In his autobiography,<ref name="Wallach">{{cite book|last=Wallach|first=Eli|title=The Good, the Bad and Me: my anecdotage|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-15-101189-3}}</ref> [[Eli Wallach]],  the movie's villain, Calvera, reports struggling to conceal his amusement while watching the filming of the funeral-procession scene where Brynner's and McQueen's characters first meet: Brynner was furious at McQueen's shotgun-round-shake, which effectively diverted the viewer's attention to McQueen.) Brynner refused to draw his gun in the same scene with McQueen, not wanting his character outdrawn.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

McQueen played the lead in the next big Sturges film, 1963's ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', Hollywood's fictional depiction of the true story of an historical mass escape from a World War II [[POW]] camp, [[Stalag Luft III]]. Insurance concerns prevented McQueen from performing the film's notable motorcycle leap, which was done by his friend and fellow cycle enthusiast [[Bud Ekins]], who resembled McQueen from a distance.<ref>Rubin, Steve. – Documentary: ''Return to 'The Great Escape''. – MGM Home Entertainment. – 1993.</ref> When [[Johnny Carson]] later tried to congratulate McQueen for the jump during a broadcast of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', McQueen said, "It wasn't me. That was Bud Ekins." This film established McQueen's box-office clout and secured his status as a superstar.<ref name="Maltin225">{{Cite book

In 1963, McQueen starred in ''[[Love with the Proper Stranger]]'' with [[Natalie Wood]]. He later appeared as the titular ''[[Nevada Smith]]'', a character from [[Harold Robbins]]' novel, ''[[The Carpetbaggers]]'', portrayed by [[Alan Ladd]] two years earlier in a [[The Carpetbaggers (film)|movie version]] of that novel.  "Nevada Smith" was an enormously successful [[Western (genre)|Western]] action adventure film, that also featured [[Karl Malden]] and [[Suzanne Pleshette]]. McQueen earned his only [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination in 1966 for his role as an engine-room sailor in ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'', in which he stars opposite [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Richard Attenborough]] (with whom he'd previously worked in ''The Great Escape'').<ref name="William F. Nolan">[[William F. Nolan]]. ''McQueen''. 1984. Congdon & Weed Inc. ISBN 0-312-92526-3</ref>

He followed his Oscar nomination with 1968's ''[[Bullitt]]'', one of his most famous films, which co-starred [[Jacqueline Bisset]], [[Robert Vaughn]] and [[Don Gordon (actor)|Don Gordon]]. It featured an unprecedented (and endlessly imitated) auto chase through San Francisco. Although McQueen did do the driving that appeared in closeup, this was about 10% of what is seen in the film's car chase. The rest of the driving by the McQueen character was done by stunt drivers Bud Ekins and Loren Janes.<ref name=myers20110126>{{cite news|last=Myers|first=Marc|title=Chasing the Ghosts of 'Bullitt'|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704698004576104001598265530.html?mod=WSJ_LifeStyle_Lifestyle_5|accessdate=2011-01-26|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=2011-01-26}}</ref> ''Bullitt'' went so far over budget that [[Warner Brothers]] cancelled the contract on the rest of his films, seven in all.

When ''Bullitt'' became a huge box-office success [[Warner Brothers]] tried to woo him back, but he refused, and his next film was made with an independent studio and released by [[United Artists]]. For this film, McQueen went for a change of image, playing a debonair role as a wealthy executive in ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' with [[Faye Dunaway]] in 1968. The following year he made the Southern [[period piece]] ''[[The Reivers (film)|The Reivers]]''.

===The 1970s===
[[File:Steve McQueen.jpg|thumb|right|1972 booking photos in Alaska]]
In 1971 McQueen starred in the poorly received auto-racing drama ''[[Le Mans (film)|Le Mans]]''. Then came ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' in 1972, a story of an aging rodeo rider.  He worked for director [[Sam Peckinpah]] again with the leading role in  ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]'' where he met future wife [[Ali MacGraw]]. He followed this with a physically demanding role as a [[Devil's Island]] prisoner in 1973's ''[[Papillon (film)|Papillon]]'', featuring [[Dustin Hoffman]] as his character's tragic [[sidekick]].

In 1973, The [[Rolling Stones]] referred to McQueen in the song "[[Star Star]]" from the album ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'' for which an amused McQueen reportedly gave personal permission.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Tony|title=The Rolling Stones: an illustrated record|year=1976|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=0-517-52641-7|page=77}}</ref> The lines were "Star fucker, star fucker, star fucker, star fucker star/
Yes you are, yes you are, yes you are/Yeah, Ali MacGraw got mad with you/For givin' head to Steve McQueen".

By the time of ''The Getaway'', McQueen was the world's highest paid actor. But after 1974's ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]'', co-starring with his long-time professional rival [[Paul Newman]] and reuniting him with Dunaway, became a tremendous box-office success, McQueen all but disappeared from the public eye, to focus on motorcycle racing and traveling around the country in a [[motorhome]] and on his vintage [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]] motorcycles. He did not return to acting until 1978 with ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'', playing against type as a bearded, bespectacled 19th-century doctor in this adaptation of a [[Henrik Ibsen]] play. The film was seen only briefly in theaters and is available on DVD.

His last two films were loosely based on true stories: ''[[Tom Horn (film)|Tom Horn]]'', a Western adventure about a former Army scout-turned professional gunman who worked for the big cattle ranchers hunting down rustlers, and later hanged for murder in the shooting death of a sheepherder, and ''[[The Hunter (1980 film)|The Hunter]]'', an urban action movie about a modern-day [[bounty hunter]], both released in 1980.

===Missed roles===
McQueen was offered the lead male role in ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' but was unable to accept due to his ''Wanted: Dead or Alive'' contract (the role went to [[George Peppard]]).<ref name="terrillx1x"/><ref name=JonesM-MS-1994-03-19>Jones Meg. – "McQueen biography is portrait of a rebel". – ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]''. – March 19, 1994.</ref> He turned down parts in ''[[Ocean's 11]]'',<ref>Rahner, Mark. – "Speeding "Bullitt" – New DVD collections remind us why McQueen was the King of Cool". – ''[[The Seattle Times]]''. – June 12, 2005.</ref> ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (his attorneys and agents could not agree with Paul Newman's attorneys and agents on top billing),<ref name="terrillx1x"/><ref name=JonesM-MS-1994-03-19/> ''[[The Driver]]'',<ref>Burger, Mark. – "Walter Hill Crime Story from 1978 Led the Way in its Genre". – ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]''. – June 9, 2005.</ref><ref>French, Philip. – Review: "DVD club: No 44 The Driver". – ''[[The Observer]]'' – November 5, 2006.</ref> ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'',<ref>Nolan, William F.

According to director [[John Frankenheimer]] and actor [[James Garner]] in bonus interviews for the DVD of the film ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'', McQueen was Frankenheimer's first choice for the lead role of American Formula One race car driver Pete Aron. Frankenheimer was unable to meet with McQueen to offer him the role and sent Edward Lewis, his business partner and the producer of ''Grand Prix''. McQueen and Lewis instantly clashed, the meeting was a disaster, and the role went to Garner.

Director [[Steven Spielberg]] said McQueen was his first choice for the character of Roy Neary in the movie ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''. According to Spielberg, in a documentary on the ''Close Encounters'' DVD, Spielberg met him at a bar, where McQueen drank beer after beer. Before leaving, McQueen told Spielberg that he could not accept the role because he was unable to cry on cue.<ref>Clarke, Roger. – "The Independent: Close Encounters of the Third Kind 9pm Film4". – ''[[The Independent]]''. – April 21, 2007.</ref><ref>Tucker, Reed, Isaac Guzman and John Anderson. – "Cinema Paradiso: The True Story of an Incredible Year in Film". – ''[[New York Post]]''. – August 5, 2007.</ref> Spielberg offered to take the crying scene out of the story, but McQueen demurred, saying that it was the best scene in the script. The role eventually went to [[Richard Dreyfuss]].

[[William Friedkin]] wanted to cast McQueen as the lead in the action/thriller film ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'' (1977). ''Sorcerer'' was to be filmed primarily on location in the [[Dominican Republic]], but McQueen did not want to be separated from Ali MacGraw for the duration of the shoot. McQueen therefore asked Friedkin to let MacGraw act as a producer, so she could be present during principal photography. Friedkin would not agree to this condition, and cast [[Roy Scheider]] instead of McQueen. Friedkin later remarked that not casting McQueen hurt the film's performance at the box-office.

Spy novelist [[Jeremy Duns]] revealed that Steve McQueen was considered for the lead role in a film adaptation of ''[[The Diamond Smugglers]]'', written by [[James Bond]] creator [[Ian Fleming]];  McQueen would play 'John Blaize', a secret agent gone undercover to infiltrate a diamond-smuggling ring in South Africa. There were complications with the project which was eventually shelved, although a 1964 screenplay does exist.<ref>"From Johannesburg With Love", in ''The Sunday Times'', 7 March 2010</ref>

McQueen and [[Barbra Streisand]] were tentatively cast in ''[[The Gauntlet (film)|The Gauntlet]]'', but the two did not get along due to a clash of egos. Both withdrew from the project, and the lead roles were filled in by [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Sondra Locke]].

McQueen expressed interest in the [[John Rambo|Rambo]] character in ''[[First Blood]]'' when [[David Morrell]]'s novel appeared in 1972, but the producers rejected him because of his age.<ref>Toppman, Lawrence. – "Will He of Won't He?". – ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]''. – May 22, 1988.</ref><ref>Morrell, David, Jay MacDonald. – "Writers find fame with franchises".

McQueen was offered the lead in ''[[Raise the Titanic (film)|Raise the Titanic]]'' but felt that the script was flat. He was under contract to [[Irwin Allen]] after appearing in ''The Towering Inferno'' and offered a part in a sequel in 1980, which he turned down. The film was scrapped and Newman was brought in by Allen to make ''[[When Time Ran Out]]'', which was a box office bomb. McQueen died shortly after passing on ''The Towering Inferno 2''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Stunts, motor racing and flying==
[[File:Steve McQueen 1960.JPG|thumb|right|McQueen with two forms of transportation in 1960]]
McQueen was an avid [[motorcycle]] and [[racecar]] enthusiast. When he had the opportunity to drive in a movie, he performed many of his own stunts, including some of the car chase in ''[[Bullitt]]'' and the motorcycle chase in ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''. Although the jump over the fence in ''The Great Escape'' was done by [[Bud Ekins]] for insurance purposes, McQueen did have considerable screen time riding his 650cc [[Triumph TR6 Trophy]] motorcycle. It was difficult to find riders as skilled as McQueen.<ref>According to the commentary track on ''The Great Escape'' DVD.</ref> At one point, using editing, McQueen is seen in a German uniform chasing himself on another bike. Around half of the driving in Bullitt was performed by [[Loren Janes]].<ref name=myers20110126>{{cite news|last=Myers|first=Marc|title=Chasing the Ghosts of 'Bullitt'|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704698004576104001598265530.html?mod=WSJ_LifeStyle_Lifestyle_5|accessdate=2011-01-26|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=2011-01-26}}</ref>

McQueen and [[John Sturges]] planned to make ''Day of the Champion,'' <ref>McQueen Toffel, Neile, (1986). – Excerpt: [http://www.thesandpebbles.com/neile_mcqueen/neile_mcqueen.htm ''My Husband, My Friend'']. – (c/o The Sand Pebbles). – New York, New York: Atheneum. – ISBN 0-689-11637-3</ref> a movie about [[Formula One]] racing, but McQueen was busy with the delayed ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]].''  They had a contract with the German [[Nürburgring]], and after [[John Frankenheimer]] shot scenes there for ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]],'' the reels were turned over to Sturges. Frankenheimer was ahead in schedule, and the McQueen/Sturges project was called off.

McQueen considered being a professional race car driver. He had a one off outing in the [[British Touring Car Championship]] in 1961, driving a [[British Motor Corporation|BMC]] [[Mini]] at [[Brands Hatch]], finishing 3rd.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://racedriverblog.com/from-didcot-to-mcqueen-and-mulholland-drive-sir-john-whitmore/ |title=From Didcot to McQueen and Mulholland Drive - Sir John Whitmore |publisher=Race Driver Blog |date=2013-09-22 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref> In the 1970 [[12 Hours of Sebring]] race, [[Peter Revson]] and McQueen (driving with a cast on his left foot from a motorcycle accident two weeks earlier) won with a [[Porsche 908]]/02 in the 3 litre class and missed winning overall by 23 seconds to [[Mario Andretti]]/[[Ignazio Giunti]]/[[Nino Vaccarella]] in a 5-litre [[Ferrari 512]]S. This same Porsche 908 was entered by his production company Solar Productions as a camera car for ''[[Le Mans (film)|Le Mans]]'' in the [[1970 24 Hours of Le Mans]] later that year. McQueen wanted to drive a [[Porsche 917]] with [[Jackie Stewart]] in that race, but the film backers threatened to pull their support if he did. Faced with the choice of driving for 24 hours in the race or driving for the entire summer making the film, McQueen opted for the latter.<ref name=Stone2007>Stone, Matthew L, (2007). – Excerpt: [http://www.mustangandfords.com/featuredvehicles/mufp_0712_steve_mcqueen_cars/index.html "Steve McQueen's Automotive Legacy]. – ''Mcqueen's Machines: The Cars And Bikes Of A Hollywood Icon''. – (c/o Mustang & Fords). – St. Paul, Minnesota: Motorbooks. – ISBN 0-7603-2866-8</ref>

McQueen competed in [[off-road racing|off-road motorcycle racing]], frequently running a [[BSA Hornet]].<ref name="Nolan, William 1984">Nolan, William (1984). McQueen. Congdon & Weed Inc.

McQueen raced in many top off-road races on the West Coast, including the [[Baja 1000]], the [[Mint 400]] and the [[Lake Elsinore, California|Elsinore Grand Prix]]. In 1964, with Ekins on their [[Triumph TR6 Trophy|Triumph TR6 Trophies]], McQueen formed part of the ten man United States entry, competing for the International Silver Vase award in the [[International Six Days Enduro|International Six Days Trial]], an [[off-road]] motorcycling event held that year in [[Erfurt]], [[East Germany]].<ref name="ISDT">{{cite journal|title=ISDT Sort-out|journal=Motor Cycle|publisher=Iliffe Specialist Publications Ltd|location=London|volume=113|issue=3196|page=538}}</ref> His ISDT competition number was 278, which was based on the trials starting order.<ref name="Stone1">{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Matt|title=McQueen's Machines: The Cars and Bikes of a Hollywood Icon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fo9UKUfqhA8C&pg=PA154&dq=mcqueen+ISDT&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vcS-VMKFHoiwyASlpoGYCQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=mcqueen%20ISDT&f=false|date=November 7, 2010|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=1610601114|pages=154–158}}</ref> He was inducted in the [[Off-road Motorsports Hall of Fame]] in 1978. In 1971, McQueen's Solar Productions funded the classic motorcycle documentary ''[[On Any Sunday]],'' in which McQueen is featured, along with racing legends [[Mert Lawwill]] and [[Malcolm Smith (motorcyclist)|Malcolm Smith]]. The same year, he also appeared on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' Magazine riding a [[Husqvarna Motorcycles|Husqvarna]] dirt bike.

McQueen designed a motorsports [[bucket seat]], for which a patent was issued in 1971.<ref name=Stone2007/>{{rp|93}}<ref>{{US patent|D219813}}</ref>

In a segment filmed for ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]],'' McQueen drove Sullivan around a desert area in a dune buggy at high speed. Afterward, Sullivan said, "That was a ''helluva'' ride!"

McQueen owned a number of classic motorcycles as well as several exotic sports cars, including:
* [[Porsche 917]], [[Porsche 908]] and [[Ferrari 512]] race cars from the ''Le Mans'' film.
* 1963 [[Ferrari 250]] Lusso Berlinetta<ref name="1963_Ferrari"/>
* [[Jaguar D-Type]] XKSS (Right-Hand Drive)
* [[Porsche 356]] Speedster
* 1962 Cobra
* Ford GT40

In spite of multiple attempts, McQueen was never able to purchase the [[1969 Ford Mustang|Ford Mustang GT 390]] he drove in ''[[Bullitt]],'' which featured a modified drivetrain that suited McQueen's driving style. One of the two Mustangs used in the film was badly damaged, judged beyond repair and scrapped.<ref>''[[Motor Trend|Motor Trend Classic]]'', Oct. 2006.</ref>

McQueen also flew and owned, among other aircraft, a 1945 [[Boeing-Stearman Model 75|Stearman]], tail number N3188, (his student number in reform school), a 1946 [[Piper J-3 Cub]], and an award-winning 1931 [[Pitcairn Mailwing|Pitcairn PA-8]] [[biplane]], flown in the [[United States Post Office Department|US Mail Service]] by famed World War I [[flying ace]] [[Eddie Rickenbacker]]. They were hangared at [[Santa Paula Airport]] an hour northwest of Hollywood, where he lived his final days.<ref name="Nolan, William 1984"/>

McQueen had a daily two-hour exercise regimen, involving [[Weight training|weightlifting]] and at one point, running five miles, seven days a week.

McQueen was known for his prolific drug use.  ([[William Claxton (photographer)|William Claxton]] said he smoked [[marijuana]] almost every day; biographer [[Marc Eliot (author)|Marc Eliot]] alleged he used a tremendous amount of [[cocaine]] in the early 1970s<ref>{{cite news |last=Honan |first=Corinna |date=2011-11-04 |title=The heart-throb who hated women: Wife-beater, drug-taker and relentless philanderer, the brutal truth about Steve McQueen |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2057769/Steve-McQueen-Wife-beater-drug-taker-relentless-philanderer-brutal-truth-actor.html |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |access-date=2015-03-28 }}</ref>) and he was a heavy [[cigarette]] smoker.

After [[Charles Manson]] incited the murder of five people, including McQueen's friends [[Sharon Tate]] and [[Jay Sebring]] at Tate's home on August 9, 1969, it was reported McQueen was a potential target of the killers.  According to his first wife, McQueen began carrying a handgun at all times in public, including at Sebring's funeral.<ref name="dominickdunne">[[Dominick Dunne|Dunne, Dominick]]. ''The Way We Lived Then: Recollections of a Well Known Name Dropper.'' 1999. New York, New York: Crown Publishers.

In 2011, it was revealed that Sebring had invited McQueen to the party at Tate's house on the night of the murders. According to McQueen, he had invited a girlfriend to come along, she instead suggested an intimate night at home, which probably saved his life.<ref name="Eliot"/>

McQueen had an unusual reputation for demanding free items in bulk from studios when agreeing to do a film, such as [[electric razors]], [[jeans]] and other items.  It was later discovered McQueen donated these things to the Boy's Republic [[reformatory]] School,<ref>John Dominis/Time & Life Pictures/Getty Images. "Steve McQueen Returns to Reform School" 1963, accessed February 7, 2011</ref> where he spent time in his teen years. McQueen made occasional visits to the school to spend time with the students, often to [[Pocket billiards|play pool]] and speak about his experiences.

After discovering a mutual interest in racing, McQueen and ''Great Escape'' co-star [[James Garner]] became good friends. Garner lived down hill from McQueen; and McQueen recalled, "I could see that Jim was neat around his place. Flowers trimmed, no papers in the yard ... grass always cut. So  to piss him off, I'd start lobbing empty beer cans down the hill into his driveway. He'd have his drive all spic 'n' span when he left the house, then get home to find all these empty cans.

==Illness and death==

McQueen developed a persistent cough in 1978. He gave up cigarettes and underwent antibiotic treatments without improvement. Shortness of breath grew more pronounced and on December 22, 1979, after filming ''The Hunter,'' a biopsy revealed [[pleural]] [[mesothelioma]],<ref name="lerner">{{cite book |author=Lerner BH |title=When Illness Goes Public |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore (2006) |page=141ff |isbn=0-8018-8462-4}}</ref> a cancer associated with [[asbestos]] exposure for which there is no known cure. A few months later, McQueen gave a medical interview in which he blamed his condition on asbestos exposure.<ref>Interview with Burgh Joy, clinical professor at [[UCLA]], personal archives of Barbara McQueen, 1980</ref> McQueen believed that asbestos used in movie sound stage insulation and race-drivers' protective suits and helmets could have been involved, but he thought it more likely that his illness was a direct result of massive exposure while removing asbestos lagging from pipes aboard a troop ship while in the Marines.<ref>Spiegel, Penina. ''McQueen: The Untold Story of a Bad Boy in Hollywood'', Doubleday and Co., New York (1986)</ref><ref>Sandford, Christopher, McQueen: The Biography, Taylor Trade Publishing, New York (2003)</ref>

By February 1980, there was evidence of widespread [[metastasis]]. While he tried to keep the condition a secret, the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' disclosed that he had "terminal cancer" on March 11, 1980. In July, McQueen traveled to [[Rosarito Beach]], Mexico for unconventional treatment after US doctors told him they could do nothing to prolong his life.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/15/health/15essa.html?ex=1289710800&en=8059981c17deec5d&ei=5088|title=McQueen's Legacy of Laetrile|publisher=New York Times|date=2005-11-15 | first=Barron H. | last=Lerner | accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref>

Controversy arose over McQueen's Mexican trip, because McQueen sought a non-traditional cancer treatment called the [[Gerson Therapy]] that used [[coffee enema]]s, frequent washing with shampoos, daily injections of fluid containing live cells from cows and sheep, [[massage]] and [[Amygdalin|laetrile]], an ineffective anti-cancer drug available in Mexico. McQueen paid for these unconventional medical treatments by himself in cash payments which were said to have been upwards of $40,000 per month during his three-month stay in Mexico. McQueen was treated by [[William Donald Kelley]], whose only medical license had been (until revoked in 1976) for [[orthodontics]].<ref name=WorthingtonR-RGWPC-2006-10-27>Worthington, Roger. – "A Candid Interview with Barbara McQueen 26 Years After Mesothelioma Claimed the Life of Husband and Hollywood Icon, Steve McQueen". – The Law Office of Roger G.

C-5</ref>

McQueen returned to the US in early October. Despite metastasis of the cancer through McQueen's body, Kelley publicly announced that McQueen would be completely cured and return to normal life. McQueen's condition soon worsened and "huge" tumors developed in his abdomen.<ref name=WorthingtonR-RGWPC-2006-10-27/>

In late October 1980, McQueen flew to [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], Mexico to have an abdominal tumor on his liver (weighing around five pounds) removed, despite warnings from his US doctors that the tumor was inoperable and his heart could not withstand the surgery.<ref name=WorthingtonR-RGWPC-2006-10-27/><ref name="Nolan, William F. 1984. pp. 212–213"/> McQueen checked into a Juarez clinic under the assumed name of "Sam Shepard," where the doctors and staff at the small, low-income clinic were unaware of his actual identity.

On 7 November 1980, McQueen died of [[cardiac arrest]] at 3:45 am at the Juárez clinic 12 hours after surgery to remove or reduce numerous metastatic tumors in his neck and abdomen.<ref name="Nolan, William F. 1984. pp. 212–213">Nolan, William F.

==Legacy==

McQueen remains a popular star, and his estate limits the licensing of his image to avoid the commercial saturation experienced by other deceased celebrities. As of 2007, McQueen's estate entered the top 10 of highest-earning deceased celebrities.<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?Top_10_earning_dead_stars&in_article_id=378312&in_page_id=34 Metro.co.uk] – metro Top 10 earning dead stars – October 29, 2008</ref>

===Ford commercials===

In 1998 director [[Paul Street (director)|Paul Street]] created a commercial for the [[Ford Puma]]. Footage was shot in modern day [[San Francisco]], set to the theme music from [[Bullitt]]. Archive footage of McQueen was used to digitally superimpose him driving and exiting the car in settings reminiscent of the film. The Puma shares the same number plate of classic Fastback Mustang used in the Bullitt film and as he parks in the garage (next to the Mustang), he pauses and looks meaningfully at a motorcycle tucked in the corner, similar to that used in ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''.<ref>url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipJ049HJau8</ref>

In 2005, Ford went on to use his likeness again, in a commercial for the 2005 [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]]. In the commercial, a farmer builds a winding racetrack, which he circles in the 2005 Mustang. Out of the cornfield comes Steve McQueen. The farmer tosses his keys to McQueen, who drives off in the new Mustang. McQueen's likeness was created using a body double (Dan Holsten) and digital editing. Ford secured the rights to McQueen's likeness from the actor's estate licensing agent, GreenLight, for an undisclosed sum.
