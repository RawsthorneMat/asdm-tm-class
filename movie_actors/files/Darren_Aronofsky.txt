'''Darren Aronofsky''' (born February 12, 1969) is an American film director, screenwriter and film producer. He has received acclaim for his often surreal, disturbing films and has been noted for frequent collaborations with [[cinematographer]] [[Matthew Libatique]], film editor [[Andrew Weisblum]] and composer [[Clint Mansell]]. His films have generated controversy and are known for their often violent, bleak subject matter.

Aronofsky attended [[Harvard University]], where he studied film and social anthropology, and the [[American Film Institute]] where he studied directing. He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film, ''Supermarket Sweep'', which went on to become a National Student Academy Award finalist. Aronofsky's feature debut, the surrealist psychological thriller ''[[Pi (film)|Pi]]'', was shot in November 1997. The low-budget, $60,000 production, starring [[Sean Gullette]], was sold to [[Artisan Entertainment]] for $1 million, and grossed over $3 million; Aronofsky won the Directing Award at the 1998 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and an [[Independent Spirit Awards|Independent Spirit Award]] for best first screenplay.

Aronofsky's followup, the psychological drama ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]'', was based on the [[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Hubert Selby, Jr.]] The film garnered strong reviews and received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Ellen Burstyn]]'s performance. After turning down an opportunity to direct an entry in the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film series]] and writing the [[World War II]] [[horror film]] ''[[Below (film)|Below]]'', Aronofsky began production on his third film, the romantic fantasy sci-fi drama ''[[The Fountain]]''. The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the [[box-office]], but has since garnered a [[cult following]].

His fourth film, the sports drama ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'', was released to critical acclaim and both of the film's stars, [[Mickey Rourke]] and [[Marisa Tomei]], received Academy Award nominations. In 2010 Aronofsky was an executive producer on ''[[The Fighter]]'' and his fifth feature film, the psychological horror film ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'', received further critical acclaim and [[List of accolades received by Black Swan|many accolades]], being nominated for five Academy Awards including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and winning [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Natalie Portman's performance in the film. Aronofsky received nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] at the Golden Globes, and a [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nomination. His sixth film, the biblically inspired epic ''[[Noah (2014 film)|Noah]]'', was released in theaters on March 28, 2014.

==Directing style==
[[File:Aranofsky, Libatique, Weisblum 2011.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Aronofsky with frequent collaborators Matthew Libatique and Andrew Weisblum]]

Aronofsky's first two films, ''Pi'' and ''Requiem for a Dream'', were low-budget and used [[montage (filming)|montages]] of extremely short shots, also known as [[hip hop montage]]s.<ref>{{cite book | last = Boyd | first = Susan | title = Hooked | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-415-95706-0 |pages=97–98}}</ref> While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts ''Requiem'' features more than 2,000.

With ''The Fountain'', Aronofsky restricted the use of [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name="fountaineffects"/> Henrik Fett, the visual effects supervisor of Look Effects, said, "Darren was quite clear on what he wanted and his intent to greatly minimize the use of computer graphics...

===Themes and influences===

''Pi'' features several references to mathematics and mathematical theories.<ref name="darren1"/> In a 1998 interview, Aronofsky acknowledged several influences for "Pi":
{{quote|"I'm a big fan of [[Kurosawa]] and [[Fellini]]. In this film in particular I think there's a lot of [[Roman Polanski]] influence and [[Terry Gilliam]] influence as well as a Japanese director named [[Shinya Tsukamoto]]—he directed ''[[Tetsuo: The Iron Man|The Iron Man, Tetsuo.]]''"}}
The visual style of "Pi" (and even "Requiem for a Dream") features numerous similarities to the Japanese film [[Tetsuo: The Iron Man]].<ref>[http://aronofksy.tripod.com/interview14.html "Darren Aronofsky: THE ASK HOLLYWOOD INTERVIEW"]. ''Darren Aronofsky Online'' (1998). Retrieved 2013-08-27.</ref>

The majority of reviewers characterized ''Requiem for a Dream'' in the [[genre]] of "[[drug movies]]", along with films like ''[[The Basketball Diaries (film)|The Basketball Diaries]]'', ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', ''[[Spun]]'', and ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boyd |first=Susan |title=Hooked |publisher=''Routledge'' |location=New York |year=2008 |isbn=0-415-95706-0 |pages=97–98}}</ref> But, Aronofsky placed his movie in a wider context, saying:
{{quote|''Requiem for a Dream'' is not about heroin or about drugs... The Harry-Tyrone-Marion story is a very traditional heroin story. But putting it side by side with the Sara story, we suddenly say, 'Oh, my God, what is a drug?' The idea that the same inner monologue goes through a person's head when they're trying to quit drugs, as with cigarettes, as when they're trying to not eat food so they can lose 20 pounds, was really fascinating to me. I thought it was an idea that we hadn't seen on film and I wanted to bring it up on the screen.<ref>[http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/int/2000/10/13/aronofsky "It's a punk movie"]. ''Salon.com'' (October 13, 2000). Retrieved 2010-12-12.</ref>}}

With his friend Ari Handel, Aronofsky developed the plot for ''[[The Fountain]]''; the director wrote the screenplay. In 1999, Aronofsky thought that ''[[The Matrix]]'' redefined the science fiction genre in film. He sought to make a science fiction film that explored new territory, as did ''The Matrix'' and its predecessors ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. He wanted to go beyond science fiction films with plots driven by technology and science.<ref name="epic">{{cite news | last=Linder | first=Brian | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/050/050987p1.html | title=Aronofsky, Pitt Team for Sci-Fi Epic | work=[[IGN]] | date=April 5, 2001 | accessdate=November 1, 2006}}</ref>

In the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] interview conducted by James Rocchi, Aronofsky credited the 1957 [[Charles Mingus]] song "[[The Clown (album)|The Clown]]" as a major influence on ''The Wrestler''. It's an instrumental piece, with a poem read over the music about a clown who accidentally discovers the bloodlust of the crowds and eventually kills himself in performance.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2207076/ |title=''The Wrestler'' Is Good |journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |last=Foley |first=Mick |publisher=[[The Slate Group]] |date=December 18, 2008 |accessdate=December 18, 2008 |authorlink=Mick Foley}}</ref>

Aronofsky called ''Black Swan'' a companion piece to ''The Wrestler'', recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds, considering them as "too much for one movie". He compared the two films: "Wrestling some consider the lowest art—if they would even call it art—and ballet some people consider the highest art. But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers in both of these worlds are. They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves."<ref name="kisses"/> About the psychological thriller nature of ''Black Swan'', actress Natalie Portman compared the film's tone to Polanski's 1968 film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'',<ref>{{cite news|last=Wigler |first=Josh |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/08/05/natalie-portman-likens-black-swan-to-rosemarys-baby-in-terms-of-tone/ |title=Natalie Portman Likens ''Black Swan'' To ''Rosemary's Baby'' In Terms of Tone |work=MTV Movies Blog |publisher=MTV |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rlueS6jv |archivedate=August 6, 2010}}</ref> while Aronofsky said Polanski's ''[[Repulsion]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Tenant]]'' (1976) were "big influences" on the final film.<ref name="kisses"/> Actor Vincent Cassel also compared ''Black Swan'' to Polanski's early films, commenting that it was also influenced by [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]' movies<ref>[https://www.filmin.es/blog/las-peliculas-favoritas-de-darren-aronofsky las películas favoritas de darren aronofsky&nbsp;– filmin].

Several aspects of Aronofsky's films have been controversial, most notably ''Requiem for a Dream'', ''The Wrestler'' and ''Black Swan''. ''Requiem for a Dream'' was originally set for release in 2000, but it met with controversy in the United States, being rated [[NC-17]] by the [[MPAA]] due to a graphic sex scene.<ref name="dreaming">{{cite web | url = http://www.screendaily.com/mpaa-slams-nc-17-rating-on-artisans-requiem/403357.article| title =MPAA slams NC-17 rating on Artisan's 'Requiem' | publisher = Screendaily| author = Goodridge, Mike | date= August 22, 2000 | accessdate= December 19, 2010}}</ref> Aronofsky appealed the rating, claiming that cutting any portion of the film would dilute its message.

''The Wrestler'' has been condemned as an "anti-Iranian" film in many Iran newspapers and websites, in response to a scene in which Mickey Rourke violently breaks a pole bearing an [[Flag of Iran|Iranian flag]] in half across his knee.<ref name="wrestle"/> ''Borna News'', a state-run Iranian newspaper, also criticized the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] (bad-guy) wrestler character "The Ayatollah." Portrayed as a villain, he wears Arabic items of clothing ([[keffiyeh]] and [[Bisht (clothing)|bisht]]), which the newspaper believed was intended to lead audiences to associate Iranians with Arabs.<ref name="wrestle"/> In the wrestling ring, he wears a skimpy leotard in the pattern of an Iranian flag with the [[Aleph|alef]] character, representing the first letter of the word [[Ayatollah]].<ref name="wrestle">{{Cite news  | last = Tait | first = Robert | title = Iranian official demands apology from visiting Hollywood delegation | newspaper = [[The Guardian]]  | date = December 13, 2008 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/dec/13/usa-iran-the-wrestler | location=London}}</ref>

Some Iranian newspapers avoided mentioning the character, presumably to avoid offending Iran's clerical rulers.<ref name="wrestle"/> On March 2009, [[Javad Shamaqdari]], cultural adviser to [[President of Iran|President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], demanded an apology from a delegation of [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] actors and producers visiting Iran for what he characterized as negative and unfair portrayals of the [[Islamic republic]] in ''The Wrestler'' and other Hollywood films.<ref>{{Cite news  | last = Mostaghim | first = Ramin | title = Iranian official demands apology from visiting Hollywood delegation | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]]  | date = March 2, 2009 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-iran-hollywood2-2009mar02,0,2857275.story}}</ref>

The question of who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers in ''Black Swan'' was one publicized controversy related to the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Swan: Amy Westcott Interview |url=http://clothesonfilm.com/black-swan-amy-westcott-interview/18997/ |accessdate=January 30, 2011 |publisher=Clothes on Film |first=Chris |last=Laverty |date=January 28, 2011}}</ref> The media gave substantial coverage to the [[Black Swan dance double controversy|dance double controversy]]: how much credit for the dancing in the film was being given to Portman and how much to her "[[Body double|dance double]]", [[Sarah Lane (dancer)|Sarah Lane]], an [[American Ballet Theatre]] [[soloist (ballet)|soloist]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://pointemagazine.com/issues/aprilmay-2010/call-board | title = Ballet All Over: Big Names in ''Black Swan'' | work = Pointe Magazine | publisher = Macfadden Performing Arts Media | author = Fuhrer, Margaret | date = May 21, 2010}}</ref> Lane claimed to have danced more than she was credited. The director and Fox Searchlight disputed Lane's claim. Their released statements said, "We were fortunate to have Sarah there to cover the more complicated dance sequences and we have nothing but praise for the hard work she did. However, Natalie herself did most of the dancing featured in the final film."<ref name=fs>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/26/black-swan-responds-cover-up/|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Jeff |last=Labrecque|date=March 26, 2011 |accessdate=March 26, 2011 |title='Black Swan' controversy: 'Natalie herself did most of the dancing,' insist filmmakers}}</ref>

Aronofsky said in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'':

:"I had my editor count shots. There are 139 dance shots in the film. 111 are Natalie Portman untouched. 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If you do the math, that's 80% Natalie Portman. What about duration? The shots that feature the double are wide shots and rarely play for longer than one second. There are two complicated longer dance sequences that we used face replacement. Even so, if we were judging by time, over 90% would be Natalie Portman. And to be clear, Natalie did dance [[en pointe]] in pointe shoes. If you look at the final shot of the opening prologue, which lasts 85 seconds, and was danced completely by Natalie, she exits the scene on pointe. That is completely her without any digital magic."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/28/darren-aronofsky-black-swan-controversy/|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=Adam |last=Markovitz|date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=March 28, 2011 |title='Black Swan' director Darren Aronofsky defends Natalie Portman in body-double controversy}}</ref>
