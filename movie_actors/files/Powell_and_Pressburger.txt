The [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] film-making partnership of '''[[Michael Powell]]''' (1905–1990) and '''[[Emeric Pressburger]]''' (1902–1988) — together often known as '''The Archers''', the name of their production company – made a series of influential films in the 1940s and 50s. [[:Category:Films by Powell and Pressburger|Their collaborations]] — 24 films between 1939 and 1972 – were mainly derived from original stories by Pressburger with the script written by both Pressburger & Powell. Powell did most of the directing while Pressburger did most of the work of the producer and also assisted with the editing, especially the way the music was used. Unusually, the pair shared a writer-director-producer credit for most of their films. The best known of these are ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943), ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946), ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (1947) and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1948).

In 1981 Powell and Pressburger were recognised for their contributions to [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]] with the [[BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award]], the most prestigious award given by the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]].

==History==

===Early films===
Michael Powell was already an experienced director, having worked his way up from making [[silent films]] to the [[First World War]] drama ''[[The Spy in Black]]'' (1939), his first film for Hungarian émigré producer [[Alexander Korda]]. Emeric Pressburger, who had come from [[Hungary]] in 1935, already worked for Korda, and was asked to do some rewrites for the film.<ref name="Powell 1986, pp 302-303">Powell 1986, pp 302–303</ref> This collaboration would be the first of nineteen, most over the next 18 years.

After Powell had made two further films for Korda, he was reunited with Pressburger in 1940 for ''[[Contraband (1940 film)|Contraband]]'', the first in a run of Powell and Pressburger films set during the [[Second World War]]. The second was ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (1941), which won Pressburger an [[Academy Award for Best Story]]. Both are [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]-like thrillers made as anti-Nazi propaganda.

===Birth of The Archers===
The pair adopted a joint writer-producer-director credit for their next film, ''[[One of Our Aircraft Is Missing]]'' (1942) and made reference to "The Archers" in the credits. In 1943 they incorporated their own production company, Archers Film Productions, and adopted a distinctive [[archery]] target logo which began each film. The joint credit "Written, Produced and Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger" indicates their joint responsibility for their own work and that they weren't beholden to any studio or other producers.<ref>Powell 1986, pp 386–387</ref>

In a letter to [[Wendy Hiller]] in 1942, asking her to appear in ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp|Colonel Blimp]]'', Pressburger explicitly set out 'The Archers' Manifesto'. Its five points express the pair's intentions:<ref>Macdonald, 1994. pp 189–190</ref>

# We owe allegiance to nobody except the financial interests which provide our money; and, to them, the sole responsibility of ensuring them a profit, not a loss.
# Every single foot in our films is our own responsibility and nobody else's. We refuse to be guided or coerced by any influence but our own judgement.
# When we start work on a new idea we must be a year ahead, not only of our competitors, but also of the times. A real film, from idea to universal release, takes a year. Or more.
# No artist believes in [[escapism]]. And we secretly believe that no audience does. We have proved, at any rate, that they will pay to see the truth, for other reasons than her nakedness.
# At any time, and particularly at the present, the self-respect of all collaborators, from star to prop-man, is sustained, or diminished, by the theme and purpose of the film they are working on.

They began to form a group of regular cast and crew members who were to work with them on many films over the next twelve years. Hardly any of these people were ever under contract to The Archers. They were hired film by film. But Powell and Pressburger soon learnt who they could work well with and these people enjoyed working with them.<ref>Powell, 1986. p. 579. David Farrar was the only person ever given a multi-film contract by The Archers</ref> When [[Raymond Massey]] was offered the part of the Prosecuting Attorney in ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' his cabled reply was "For The Archers anytime, this world or the next."<ref name="ALIM">Powell, 1986</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2010}}

I was rejoicing that I was going to be working with someone like this.|Powell on first meeting Pressburger|<ref name="Powell 1986, pp 302-303"/> }}

Powell and Pressburger also co-produced a few films by other directors under the banner of The Archers: ''[[The Silver Fleet]]'' (1943), written and directed by [[Vernon Sewell]] and [[Gordon Wellesley]], based on a story by Emeric Pressburger,<ref>{{IMDb title|0036356|The Silver Fleet}}</ref> and ''[[The End of the River]]'' (1947) directed by [[Derek N. Twist]] to which both Powell and Pressburger contributed un-credited writing.<ref>{{IMDb title|0039356|The End of the River}}</ref> Both Sewell and Twist had worked with Powell & Pressburger previously on other films and were being given their first chance as directors.

The remainder of the war saw them release a series of acclaimed films:

*''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943)
*''[[The Volunteer]]'' (1943) a short propaganda film
*''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'' (1944)
*''[[I Know Where I'm Going!]]'' (1945)
*''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946)

===The collaboration===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
Generally, Pressburger would create the original story (for all their films from 1940–1946 and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'') and write the first draft of the script. They would then pass the script back and forth a few times – they could never work on it together in the same room. For the actual dialogue, Pressburger would know what he wanted the characters to say but Powell would often supply some of the actual words.

They would both act as producers, perhaps Pressburger slightly more so than Powell, since he could soothe the feathers ruffled by Powell's forthright manner. They became their own producers mainly to stop anyone else interfering, since they had a considerable degree of freedom, especially under [[Rank Organisation|Rank]], to make just about any film they wanted.

The direction was nearly all done by Powell, but even so The Archers generally worked as a team, with the cast and crew often making suggestions. Pressburger was always on hand, usually on the studio floor, to make sure that these late changes fitted seamlessly into the story.

Once the filming was finished, Powell would usually go off for a walk in the hills of Scotland to clear his head, but Pressburger was often closely involved in the editing, especially in the way the music was used. Pressburger was a musician himself and had played the violin in an orchestra in Hungary.

When the film was finally ready and Powell was back from the Highlands, it would usually be Powell that would be the front man in any promotional work, such as interviews for the trade papers or fan magazines.

Because collaborative efforts such as Powell and Pressburger's were, and continue to be, unusual in the film industry, and because of the influence of the [[auteur theory]], which elevates the director as a film's primary creator, Pressburger has sometimes been dismissed as "Michael Powell's scriptwriter", but Powell himself was the first to say, in many interviews, that he couldn't have done most of what he did without Pressburger.

===Post-war success and decline===
*''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (1947)
*''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1948).
*''[[The Small Back Room]]'' (1949)
*''[[The Elusive Pimpernel]]'' (1950)
*''[[Gone to Earth (film)|Gone to Earth]]'' (1950). A substantially re-edited version was released in the US as ''The Wild Heart'' (1952) by co-producer [[David O. Selznick]], after a court battle with Powell and Pressburger.<ref>Powell, 1992. p. 81</ref> The film was fully restored by the British Film Archive in 1985.
*''[[The Tales of Hoffmann (film)|The Tales of Hoffmann]]'' (1951)

===End of the partnership===
In the early 1950s Powell and Pressburger began to produce fewer films, with notably less success. The Archers' productions officially came to an end in 1957, and the pair separated to pursue their individual careers. The separation was quite amicable and they remained devoted friends for the rest of their lives.<ref name=Arena />

*''[[Oh... Rosalinda!!]]'' (1955)
*''[[The Battle of the River Plate (film)|The Battle of the River Plate]]'' (1956)
*''[[Ill Met by Moonlight (film)|Ill Met by Moonlight]]'' (1957)

===Later collaboration===
The pair would reunite for a couple of films:

*''[[They're a Weird Mob (film)|They're a Weird Mob]]'' (1966)
*''[[The Boy Who Turned Yellow]]'' (1972)

==Awards, nominations and honours==
Four of their films are among the [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 50 British films of the 20th century]] according to the [[British Film Institute]], with ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' placing in the top 10.

British film critics gave the films of Powell and Pressburger a mixed reaction at the time, acknowledging their creativity but sometimes questioning their motivations and taste. For better or worse, The Archers were always out of step with mainstream British cinema.<ref>[http://www.powell-pressburger.org/Reviews/43_Blimp/Contemporary/index.html Contemporary reviews of ''The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp'' (1943)]</ref><ref>[http://www.powell-pressburger.org/Reviews/44_ACT/Contemporary/index.html Contemporary reviews of ''A Canterbury Tale'' (1944)]</ref><ref>[http://www.powell-pressburger.org/Reviews/45_IKWIG/Contemporary/index.html Contemporary reviews of ''I Know Where I'm Going!''

From the 1970s onwards, British critical opinion began to revise this lukewarm assessment, with their first [[British Film Institute|BFI]] retrospective in 1970 and another in 1978. They are now seen as playing a key part in the history of British film, and have become influential and iconic for many film-makers of later generations, such as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[George A. Romero]], among others.<ref name="Mirasol (2010)">{{cite web |last=Mirasol |first=M. |title="Black Narcissus," which electrified Scorsese |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=suntimes.com |date=5 March 2010 |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/foreignc/2010/03/black-narcissus-by-michael-mirasol-of-manila.html |accessdate=13 December 2010}}</ref>
