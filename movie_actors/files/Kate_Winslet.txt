Following ''The Life of David Gale'', Winslet appeared with [[Jim Carrey]] in ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'' (2004), a [[surrealism|neosurrealistic indie-drama]] by French director [[Michel Gondry]]. In the film, she played the role of Clementine Kruczynski, a chatty, spontaneous and somewhat [[neurosis|neurotic]] woman, who decides to have all memories of her ex-boyfriend erased from her mind.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hobson |first=Louis |title=Kate Winslet refutes Internet rumours |publisher=Canoe Jam! |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/W/Winslet_Kate/2004/03/15/762717.html |accessdate=6 February 2009}}</ref> The role was a departure from her previous roles, with Winslet revealing in an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' that she was initially upended about her casting in the film: "This was not the type of thing I was being offered [...] I was just thrilled that there was something he had seen in me, in spite of the corsets, that he thought was going to work for Clementine."<ref>{{cite news |last=Oei |first=Lily |title=Kate Winslet: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-127975140.html|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=3 January 2005 |accessdate=6 February 2009}}</ref> The film was a critical and financial success.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/eternalsunshineofthespotlessmind?q=Kate%20Winslet |title=Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> Winslet received rave reviews for her Academy Award-nominated performance, which [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described as "electrifying and bruisingly vulnerable."<ref>{{cite news |title=Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948633/review/5948634/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080622052028/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948633/review/5948634/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind |archivedate=22 June 2008 |last=Travers |first=Peter |date=10 March 2004 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=6 February 2009}}</ref>

Her final film in 2004 was ''[[Finding Neverland]]''. The story of the production focused on Scottish writer [[J.M. Barrie]] ([[Johnny Depp]]) and his platonic relationship with [[Sylvia Llewelyn Davies]] (Winslet), whose sons inspired him to pen the classic play ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]''. During promotion of the film, Winslet noted of her portrayal "It was very important for me in playing Sylvia that I was already a mother myself, because I don’t think I could have played that part if I didn’t know what it felt like to be a parent and have those responsibilities and that amount of love that you give to a child [...] and I've always got a baby somewhere, or both of them, all over my face."<ref>{{cite news |title=Mother Superior |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Mother-superior/2005/01/01/1104345034348.html |work=[[The Age]] |date=2 January 2005 |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> The film received favourable reviews and proved to be an international success, becoming Winslet's highest-grossing film since ''Titanic'' with a total of $118 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title=Finding Neverland (2004) |publisher=The Numbers| url=http://www.the-numbers.com/people/KWINS.php |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/findingneverland?q=Finding%20Neverland |title=Finding Neverland (2004) |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref>

In 2005, Winslet appeared in an episode of the [[BBC]]/[[HBO]] comedy series ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]] as a satirical version of herself.

Winslet played the role of Anne Stanton, the childhood sweetheart of Jack Burden (Law). The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web |title=All the King's Men (2005) |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/allthekingsmen?q=All%20the%20king's%20Men |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=All the King's Men |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2006/AKNGM.php |publisher=The Numbers |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> Todd McCarthy of ''Variety'' summed it up as "overstuffed and fatally miscast [...] Absent any point of engagement to become involved in the characters, the film feels stillborn and is unlikely to stir public excitement, even in an election year."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117931520.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&s=h&p=0|title=All the King's Men |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |date=10 September 2006 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref>

Winslet fared far better when she co-starred in [[Todd Field]]'s ''[[Little Children (film)|Little Children]]'', playing Sarah Pierce, a bored housewife who has a torrid affair with a married neighbour, played by [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]. Both her performance and the film received rave reviews; [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "In too many recent movies intelligence is woefully undervalued, and it is this quality—even more than its considerable beauty—that distinguishes ''Little Children'' from its peers. The result is a film that is challenging, accessible and hard to stop thinking about. Ms. Winslet, as fine an actress as any working in movies today, registers every flicker of Sarah’s pride, self-doubt and desire, inspiring a mixture of recognition, pity and concern that amounts, by the end of the movie, to something like love. That Ms. Winslet is so lovable makes the deficit of love in Sarah’s life all the more painful."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2006/09/29/movies/29chil.html |title=Playground Rules: No Hitting, No Sex |last=Scott |first=A.O. |date=29 September 2006 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=29 September 2006}}</ref> For her work in the film, she was honoured with a Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year from BAFTA/LA, a Los Angeles-based offshoot of the [[BAFTA Awards]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The BAFTA/LA Britannia Awards |url=http://www.baftala.org/britannia.php?PHPSESSID=a2ef3a60a19816140e0f4dd0860e046b |publisher=BAFTALA.org |accessdate=20 February 2009}}</ref> was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and at 31, became the youngest actress to ever garner five Oscar nominations.<ref>{{cite news |title=This year's Oscar fun facts |first=Phil |last=Gallo |url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117957938.html |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=23 August 2007 }}</ref>

She followed ''Little Children'' with a role in [[Nancy Meyers]]' [[romantic comedy]] ''[[The Holiday]]'', also starring [[Cameron Diaz]], Jude Law and [[Jack Black]]. In it she played Iris, a British woman who temporarily [[house swapping|exchanges homes]] with an American woman (Diaz). Released to a mixed reception by critics,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Holiday (2006) |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/holiday?q=Kate%20Winslet |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> the film became Winslet's biggest commercial success in nine years, grossing more than $205 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Holiday |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2006/HOLID.php |publisher=The Numbers |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref> Also in 2006, Winslet provided her voice for several smaller projects. In the CG-animated ''[[Flushed Away]]'', she voiced Rita, a scavenging sewer rat who helps Roddy ([[Hugh Jackman]]) escape from the city of Ratropolis and return to his luxurious [[Kensington]] origins. A critical and commercial success, the film collected $177,665,672 at international box offices.<ref>{{cite web |title=Flushed Away |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2006/FLUSH.php |publisher=The Numbers |accessdate=7 February 2009}}</ref>

In 2007, Winslet reunited with Leonardo DiCaprio to film ''[[Revolutionary Road (film)|Revolutionary Road]]'' (2008), directed by her husband at the time, [[Sam Mendes]].

=== Academy Award nomination milestones ===

[[File:KateWinsletAAFeb09.jpg|thumb|upright|Winslet at the [[81st Academy Awards]] in February 2009]]
Winslet set the mark as the youngest actor to receive five nominations, at age 31, for ''Little Children'' (2006). She surpassed [[Bette Davis]], who was 33 when she received her fifth nomination for her performance in ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' (1941).<ref>{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Ephraim|year=1994|title=The Film Encyclopedia|edition=2nd|location=New York|publisher=HarperPerrenial|pages=332–33|isbn=0-06-273089-4}}</ref> With her Best Actress nomination for ''The Reader'', Winslet became the youngest actress to receive six Oscar nominations. At age 33, Winslet passed the mark Davis, one year older, set with ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942).<ref>{{cite web|last=Goodridge |first=Mike |title=''Benjamin Button'' Tops Oscar Nominations |url=http://www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=42788 |work=Screen Daily|date=22 January 2009 |accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref>

Winslet received Academy Award nominations as the younger versions of the characters played by fellow nominees [[Gloria Stuart]], as Rose, in ''Titanic'' (1997)<ref name="roles"/> and [[Judi Dench]], as Iris Murdoch, in ''Iris''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Vallely|title=Kate Winslet: The gold girl|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/kate-winslet-the-golden-girl-1418269.html|work=The Independent|date=17 January 2009}}</ref> These are the only instances of the younger and older versions of a character in the same film both yielding Academy Award nominations, thus making Winslet the only actor to twice share an Oscar nomination with another for portraying the same character.<ref name="roles">{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Barber|title=Test Your Knowledge of Academy Award History |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/oscars/oscartriviaquiz98.htm|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=22 March 1998}}</ref>

When she was not nominated for her work in ''Revolutionary Road'', Winslet became only the second actress to win a Golden Globe for Best Actress (Drama) without getting an Oscar nomination for the same performance ([[Shirley MacLaine]] was the first for ''[[Madame Sousatzka]]'' (1988), and she won the Golden Globe in a three-way tie). Academy rules allow an actor to receive no more than one nomination in a given category; as the Academy nominating process determined that Winslet's work in ''The Reader'' would be considered a lead performance—unlike the Golden Globes, which considered it a supporting performance—she could not also receive a Best Actress nomination for ''Revolutionary Road''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Graham, Mark|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/01/kate_winslets_unprecedented_os.html|title=Getting to the Bottom of Kate Winslet’s Unprecedented Oscar Snubs|work=New York|date=23 January 2009|accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Brevet, Brad|url=http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/article/winslet-oscar-query-solved-and-the-dark-knight-probably-wasnt-snubbed|title= Winslet Oscar Query Solved and 'The Dark Knight' Probably Wasn’t Snubbed|publisher=RopeOfSilicon.com|date=23 January 2009|accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref>
