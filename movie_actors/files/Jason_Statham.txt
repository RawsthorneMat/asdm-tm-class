Statham's life in the media began when he was spotted by the agency Sports Promotions specialising in sports modelling while he was training at London's [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre]]. Afterwards, he became a model for the clothing brand [[French Connection (clothing)|French Connection]]. A spokesperson for the high street clothing chain said: "We chose Jason because we wanted our model to look like a normal guy. His look is just right for now: very masculine and not too male-modelly."<ref name="I0695"/> However, he was still forced to follow in his father's footsteps as a street seller to make ends meet, selling "fake perfume and jewellery on street corners" according to Statham.<ref name="TS">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD7qdNqozOs|title=Today Show Interview Jason Statham|publisher=''Today Show''|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> He made small appearances in a few music videos including "Comin' On Strong" by [[The Shamen]] in 1993, "[[Run to the Sun]]" by [[Erasure]] in 1994 and "Dream a Little Dream of Me" by [[The Beautiful South]] in 1995.

== Career ==
[[File:Jason Statham 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statham signing autographs at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International.]]
While working as a model for French Connection, he was introduced to fledgling British director [[Guy Ritchie]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Jason Statham|url=http://www.askmen.com/men/celeb_profiles_entertainment/19_jason_statham.html|work=AskMen|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc|accessdate=18 August 2012|author=AskMen|year=1996–2012}}</ref>  who was developing a film project and needed to fill the role of a street-wise con artist. After learning about Statham's past as a [[black market]] salesman, Ritchie cast him to play the role of "Bacon" in his 1998 crime comedy thriller ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]''.<ref name="filmbug">{{cite web|title=Jason Statham|url=http://www.filmbug.com/db/342545|work=Filmbug|publisher=MISJA.COM|accessdate=18 August 2012|author=Filmbug|year=1998–2012}}</ref> The movie was well received by both critics and audiences, and helped put Statham in the public eye. Statham's second collaboration with Ritchie came in the 2000 film ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'', playing the role of "Turkish". Cast alongside popular actors [[Brad Pitt]], [[Dennis Farina]] and [[Benicio del Toro]], and with the movie earning more than $80&nbsp;million in box-office revenue, Statham was able to break into Hollywood and appeared in two movies in 2001: the science fiction action horror film ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'' and the science fiction Martial arts action film ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]''.

Statham was offered more film roles, and in 2002 he was cast as the lead role of driver Frank Martin in the action movie ''[[The Transporter]]'', in which he was responsible for his own stunts (Statham has made this choice for all of his films).<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Most Popular Actors Who Do Their Own Stunts|url=http://www.tiptoptens.com/2011/05/18/10-most-popular-actors-who-do-their-own-stunts/|work=Tip Top Tens|publisher=Tip Top Tens|accessdate=18 August 2012|author=Sidrah Zaheer|year=2011}}</ref> He has studied [[Wing Chun]] [[kung fu]], [[karate]], and [[kickboxing]].<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/community/chat/2002-10-10-statham.htm Jason Statham interview] USAToday.com, 10 October 2002.</ref> The film spawned two sequels, ''[[Transporter 2]]'' (2005) and ''[[Transporter 3]]'' (2008).

In 2009, Statham started to develop a new movie written by [[David Peoples]] and [[Janet Peoples]]. Statham stated "We've got a movie we're trying to do, written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples, in the vein of an old film, ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre''. It’s not a remake or anything, but it's a little bit like that, about relationships and how greed contaminates the relationships these three people have.
