'''Robert Lowery''' (October 17, 1913 – December 26, 1971) was an [[United States|American]] [[motion picture]], [[television]], and stage [[actor]] who appeared in over seventy films.

==Early life==
Born '''Robert Larkin Hanks''' in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], Lowery grew up on Wayne Avenue near the long-demolished Electric Park. Lowery's father was a local attorney and oil investor who worked several years for the Pullman Corporation as a railroad agent; his mother, Leah Thompson Hanks, was a concert [[pianist]]. 

He graduated from [[Paseo High School]] in Kansas City, and soon was invited to sing with the [[Slats Randall Orchestra]] in the early 1930s. Lowery played on the Kansas City Blues minor league baseball team and was overall considered a versatile athlete; his physique and strength were gained from a stint working in a paper factory as a teenager.  After the death of his father in 1935, he traveled to [[Hollywood]] with  his mother and their housekeeper, and enrolled in the [[Lila Bliss]] acting school before being signed by [[Twentieth Century Fox]] in 1937.
