'''John Samuel Waters, Jr.''' (born April 22, 1946) is an American [[film director]], [[screenwriter]], author, actor, stand-up comedian, journalist, [[visual artist]], and [[art collector]], who rose to fame in the early 1970s for his [[Cinema of Transgression|transgressive cult films]]. Waters's 1970s and early '80s films feature his regular troupe of actors known as the [[Dreamlanders]]—among them [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], [[Mink Stole]], [[David Lochary]], [[Mary Vivian Pearce]], and [[Edith Massey]]. Starting with ''[[Desperate Living]]'' (1977), Waters began casting real-life convicted criminals ([[Liz Renay]], [[Patty Hearst]]) and controversial people ([[Traci Lords]], a former [[pornographic actor|pornographic actress]]).

Waters dabbled in mainstream filmmaking with ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' (1988), which introduced [[Ricki Lake]] and earned a modest gross of $8 million in the US. In 2002, ''Hairspray'' was adapted to a long-running [[Hairspray (musical)|Broadway musical]], which itself was adapted to a hit [[Hairspray (2007 film)|musical film]] that earned more than $200 million worldwide. After the crossover success of the original film version of ''Hairspray'', Waters's films began featuring familiar actors and celebrities such as [[Johnny Depp]], [[Edward Furlong]], [[Melanie Griffith]], [[Chris Isaak]], [[Johnny Knoxville]], [[Martha Plimpton]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[Lili Taylor]], [[Kathleen Turner]], and [[Tracey Ullman]].

Although he maintains apartments in [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], and a summer home in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]], Waters still mainly resides in his hometown of [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], where all his films are set. He is recognizable by his trademark [[pencil moustache]], a look he has retained since the early 1970s.

==Early life==
Waters was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Patricia Ann ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Whitaker) and John Samuel Waters, who was a manufacturer of fire-protection equipment.<ref name="John Waters Biography 1946-">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/8/John-Waters.html |title=John Waters Biography (1946–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03}}</ref> His family were upper-middle class [[Roman Catholic]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/218832/John-Waters/biography |title=John Waters – Biography|publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03}}</ref> Waters grew up in [[Lutherville, Maryland]], a suburb of Baltimore. His boyhood friend and muse Glenn Milstead, later known as [[Divine (actor)|Divine]], also lived in Lutherville.

The movie ''[[Lili]]'' inspired an interest in puppets in the seven-year-old Waters, who proceeded to stage violent versions of ''[[Punch and Judy]]'' for children's birthday parties. Biographer <!-- No "e" in Robrt -->Robrt L. Pela says that Waters's mother believes the puppets in ''Lili'' had the greatest influence on Waters's subsequent career (though Pela believes tacky films at a local [[Drive-in theater|drive-in]], which the young Waters watched from a distance through binoculars, had a greater effect).<ref>{{harvnb|Pela|2002}}</ref>

''[[Cry-Baby]]'' was also a product of Waters's boyhood, because of his fascination as a 7-year-old with the "[[Greaser (subculture)|Drapes]]" then receiving intense news coverage because of the murder of a young ''[[Carolyn Wasilewski|drapette]]'', coupled with his awed admiration for a young man who lived across the street and who possessed a [[hot rod]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kay|first1=Kimberley|title=Cry-Baby and John Waters' Journey to Broadway|url=http://www.broadway.com/buzz/97214/backstory-cry-baby-and-john-waters-journey-to-broadway/|accessdate=4 November 2014|publisher=Broadway.com|date=3 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Waters|first1=John|title=Role Model|date=2010|publisher=MacMillan|isbn=1429944579|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x0G8kwDFHPYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22Carolyn%20Wasilewski%22&f=false}}</ref>

Waters was privately educated at the [[Calvert School]] in Baltimore. After attending Towson Jr. High School in [[Towson, Maryland]],<ref>Towsontown Jr. High Yearbook, "The Key". Towson, Maryland 1959–1960, p.&nbsp;33</ref> and [[Calvert Hall College High School]] in nearby [[Towson, Maryland|Towson]], he ultimately graduated from [[Boys' Latin School of Maryland]]. For his sixteenth birthday, Waters received an [[8 mm film|8mm]] movie camera from his maternal grandmother, Stella Whitaker.

==Career==

===Early career===
His first short film was ''[[Hag in a Black Leather Jacket]]''. According to Waters, the film was shown only once in a "beatnik coffee house" in Baltimore, although in later years he has included it in his traveling photography exhibit.

Waters enrolled at [[New York University]] (NYU). The school, however, was not what Waters had in mind:

<blockquote>NYU...I was there for about five minutes. I don't know what I was thinking about. I went to one class and they kept talking about ''[[Battleship Potemkin|Potemkin]]'' and that isn't what I wanted to talk about. I had just gone to see ''[[George Weiss (producer)#The Olga series|Olga's House of Shame]]''. That was what I was more into.</blockquote>

Extremely influential to his creative mind, Waters tells [[Robert K. Elder]] in an interview for ''[[The Film That Changed My Life]]'', was ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

<blockquote>I was always drawn to forbidden subject matter in the very, very beginning. ''The Wizard of Oz'' opened me up because it was one of the first movies I ever saw. It opened me up to villainy, to screenwriting, to costumes. And great dialogue. I think the witch has great, great dialogue.<ref>Waters, John. Interview by Robert K. Elder. ''The Film That Changed My Life'' by Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p281. Print.</ref></blockquote>

Waters has further credited his influences as, among others, [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[William Castle]] and [[Ingmar Bergman]]. He has stated that he takes an equal amount of joy and influence from high-brow "art" films and sleazy exploitation films.

In January 1966, Waters and some friends were caught smoking marijuana on the grounds of NYU; he was soon kicked out of his NYU dormitory. Waters returned to Baltimore, where he completed his next two short films ''[[Roman Candles (film)|Roman Candles]]'' and ''[[Eat Your Makeup]]''.<ref name="John Waters Biography 1946-"/> These were followed by the feature-length films ''[[Mondo Trasho]]'' and ''[[Multiple Maniacs]]''.

Waters's films would become Divine's primary star vehicles. All of Waters's early films were shot in the Baltimore area with his company of local actors, the [[Dreamlanders]]. In addition to Divine, the group included [[Mink Stole]], [[Cookie Mueller]], [[Edith Massey]], [[David Lochary]], [[Mary Vivian Pearce]], [[Susan Walsh (actress)|Susan Walsh]], and others. These early films were among the first picked up for distribution by the fledgling [[New Line Cinema]]. Waters's later films premiered at Baltimore's [[Senator Theatre]] and sometimes at the [[Charles Theatre]].

Waters's early campy movies present exaggerated characters in outrageous situations with hyperbolic dialogue. ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Female Trouble]]'', and ''[[Desperate Living]]'', which he labeled the ''Trash Trilogy'', pushed hard at the boundaries of conventional propriety and movie censorship. A particularly notorious scene from ''Pink Flamingos'', added as a [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]] to the film's end, featured—in one continuous take without special effects—a small dog defecating and Divine eating its feces.

===Move toward the mainstream===
Waters's 1981 film ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' starred Divine opposite former teen idol [[Tab Hunter]]. Since then, his films have become less controversial and more mainstream, although works such as ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'', ''[[Cry-Baby]]'', ''[[Serial Mom]]'', ''[[Pecker (film)|Pecker]]'', and ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' still retain his trademark inventiveness. The film ''Hairspray'' was turned into a [[Hairspray (musical)|hit Broadway musical]] that swept the [[57th Tony Awards|2003 Tony Awards]], and a [[Hairspray (2007 film)|film adaptation of the Broadway musical]] was released in theaters on July 20, 2007 to positive reviews and commercial success. ''Cry-Baby'', itself a musical, was also converted into a [[Cry-Baby (musical)|Broadway musical]].

In 2004, the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|NC-17]]-rated ''[[A Dirty Shame]]'' marked a return to his earlier, more controversial work of the 1970s. He had a cameo in ''[[Jackass Number Two]]'', which starred ''Dirty Shame'' co-star [[Johnny Knoxville]], and another small role as [[Paparazzi|paparazzo]] Pete Peters in 2004's ''[[Seed of Chucky]]''.

In 2007, he became the host ("The Groom Reaper") of ''[['Til Death Do Us Part (U.S. TV series)|'Til Death Do Us Part]]'', a program on America's [[TruTV|Court TV]] network featuring dramatizations of marriages that soured and ended in murder.

In 2008, Waters was planning to make a children's Christmas film called ''Fruitcake''<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Zack |url=http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A160709 |title=Interview |publisher=Indyweek.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03}}</ref> starring [[Johnny Knoxville]] and [[Parker Posey]].<ref name =gaychicago>{{cite news

Waters has been known to create characters with alliterated names for his films including Corny Collins, Cuddles Kovinsky, Donald and Donna Dasher, Dawn Davenport, Fat Fuck Frank, Francine Fishpaw, Link Larkin, Motormouth Maybelle, Mole McHenry, Penny and Prudy Pingleton, Ramona Ricketts, Sandy Sandstone, Sylvia Stickles, Todd Tomorrow, Tracy Turnblad, Ursula Udders, Wade Walker, and Wanda Woodward.

===Fine art===
Since the early 1990s, Waters has been making photo-based artwork and installations that have been internationally exhibited in galleries and museums. In 2004, the [[New Museum]] in New York City presented a retrospective of his artwork curated by [[Marvin Heiferman]] and Lisa Phillips. His most recent exhibition was ''Rear Projection'' in April 2009, at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York and the [[Gagosian Gallery]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{harvnb|Waters|2006}}</ref> Waters has been represented by [[C. Grimaldis Gallery]] in Baltimore, Maryland since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgrimaldisgallery.com/2010/06/03/john-waters/ |title=John Waters |publisher=C. Grimaldis Gallery |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03}}</ref>

Waters's pieces are often comical, such as ''Rush'' (2009), a super-sized, tipped-over bottle of [[poppers]] (nitrite inhalants) and ''Hardy Har'' (2006), a photograph of flowers that squirts water at anyone who traverses a taped line on the floor. Waters has characterized his art as conceptual, saying that "the craft is not the issue here. The idea is. And the presentation."<ref>Levi, Lawrence. "[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/32381/inside-man/ Inside Man]." ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'', September 2009.</ref>

===Other interests===
Waters is something of a [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]], with a collection of over 8,000 books. When Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson visited Waters in his home in 2011 he commented, <blockquote>Bookshelves line the walls but they are not enough. The coffee table, desk and side tables are heaped with books, as is the replica electric chair in the hall. They range from Taschen art tomes such as ''The Big Butt Book'' to [[Jean Genet]] paperbacks and a Hungarian translation of [[Tennessee Williams]] with a [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] cover. In one corner sits a doll from the horror spoof ''Seed of Chucky'', in which Waters appeared. It feels like an eccentric professor's study, or a carefully curated exhibition based on the life of a fictional character.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edgecliffe-Johnson|first=Andrew|title=John Waters on the couch|journal=FT (Financial Times) Magazine|date=18 November 2011}}</ref> </blockquote>

He has had his fan mail delivered to Atomic Books, an independent bookstore in Baltimore, for over 20 years.

Puffing constantly on a cigarette, Waters appeared in a short film shown in film art houses announcing that "no smoking" is permitted in the theaters. This short spot was filmed by Waters for the [[Nuart Theatre]] (a [[Landmark Theatres|Landmark Theater]]) in [[West Los Angeles]], [[California]], in appreciation to the theater for showing ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' for many years. It is shown immediately before any of his films, and before the midnight movie showing of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''. Waters has since quit smoking himself.

He played a minister in ''[[Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat]]'', which was directed by one of his idols, [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]], and is a sequel to [[Blood Feast|one of his favorite exploitation films]].

Waters serves as a board member of [[Maryland Film Festival]], and has selected and hosted one favorite feature film within each Maryland Film Festival since its launch in 1999. [[Maryland Film Festival#John Waters picks|Waters' picks]] have ranged from [[Joseph Losey]]'s ''[[Boom! (1968 film)|Boom!]]'' to [[Gaspar Noé]]'s ''[[I Stand Alone (film)|I Stand Alone]]''.

===Work in progress===
Saying, "My life is so over-scheduled, what will happen if I give up control?", Waters completed a [[hitchhiking]] journey across the United States from Baltimore to [[San Francisco]] turning his adventures into a book entitled ''Carsick''.<ref name=NYT-Carsick>{{cite news|last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |title=John Waters Tries Some Desperate Living on a Cross-Country Hitchhiking Odyssey|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/john-waters-tries-some-desperate-living-on-a-cross-country-hitchhiking-odyssey/|accessdate=28 May 2012 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=25 May 2012}}</ref> On May 15, 2012, while on the hitchhiking trip, Waters was picked up by 20-year-old [[Myersville, Maryland]] [[City council#United States and Canada|councilman]] Brett Bidle, who thought Waters was a homeless hitchhiker standing in the pouring rain. Feeling bad for Waters, he agreed to drive him four hours to [[Ohio]].<ref name=Bidle>{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Ike|title=A hitchhiker's guide ...: Myersville man gives filmmaker John Waters a ride|url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/news/display.htm?storyid=136150|accessdate=28 May 2012|newspaper=FrederickNewsPost.com|date=24 May 2012}}</ref>

The next day, [[indie rock]] band [[Here We Go Magic]] [[Twitter|tweeted]] that they had picked John Waters up hitchhiking in Ohio. He was wearing a hat that said, "Scum of the Earth".<ref>{{cite news | last=Rosen | first=Jill |title=Baltimore Insider | work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date = 18 May 2012|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/baltimore-insider-blog/bal-director-john-waters-hitchhiking-in-ohiowhy-20120516,0,3141022.story|accessdate = 28 May 2012 }}</ref> In [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], Waters reconnected with Bidle (who had made an effort to catch up with him); Bidle then drove him another {{convert|1,000|mi|km}} to [[Reno, Nevada]]. Before parting ways, Waters arranged for Bidle to stay at his San Francisco apartment. "I thought, you know what, he wanted an adventure, too," said Waters. "He's the first Republican I'd ever vote for."<ref name=NYT-Carsick/>

Bidle later said, "We are polar opposites when it comes to our politics, religious beliefs. But that's what I loved about the whole trip. It was two people able to agree to disagree and still move on and have a great time. I think that's what America's all about."<ref name=NYT-Carsick/>

===Awards===
In 1999, Waters was honored with the Filmmaker on the Edge Award at the [[Provincetown International Film Festival]].

==Personal life==
In 2009, he advocated the parole of former [[Manson family]] member [[Leslie Van Houten]]. He devotes a chapter to Van Houten in his book ''Role Models'' published by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-waters/leslie-van-houten-a-frien_b_246953.html |title=Leslie Van Houten: A Friendship |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-08-09/news/0908070119_1_manson-family-leslie-van-houten-john-waters |title=John Waters Gets Serious |publisher=Baltimore Sun |date=2009-08-09 |accessdate=2013-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.wbur.org/news/npr/111675368 |title=John Waters Argues For Murderer's Release |publisher=Wbur.org |date=1969-12-31 |accessdate=2013-01-03}}</ref>

In 2011, John Waters visited [[Lake Forest College]] to give a speech, and was interviewed by the professor [[Davis Schneiderman]].<ref name=Schneiderman>{{cite web|last=Schneiderman|first=Davis|title=My Type Doesn't Know Who I Am: An Interview with John Waters|url=http://www.thenervousbreakdown.com/dschneiderman/2011/03/john-waters/|website=The Nervous Breakdown|accessdate=8 July 2012}}</ref>

An openly gay man, Waters is also an avid supporter of [[gay rights]] and [[gay pride]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamlandnews.com/fans/grizelda.shtml |title=Fans |publisher=Dreamland News |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03}}</ref>

Waters was a great fan of the music of [[Little Richard]] when growing up, claiming that ever since shoplifting a copy of his song "[[Lucille (Little Richard song)|Lucille]]" at the age of 11, "I've wished I could somehow climb into Little Richard's body, hook up his heart and vocal cords to my own, and switch identities." In 1987, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine employed Waters to interview his idol, but the interview did not go well, with Waters later remarking that "it turned into kind of a disaster."<ref>{{cite news | last = Waters | first = John | coauthors = | title = When John Waters met Little Richard | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 28 November 2010 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/nov/28/john-waters-met-little-richard | accessdate = 30 November 2009 }}</ref>
