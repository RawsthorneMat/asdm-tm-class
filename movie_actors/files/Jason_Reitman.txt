His father, Ivan, directed the films ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', and ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]''. Reitman grew up on set, and has photos of himself as a baby on the set of ''[[Animal House]]'' in 1978.<ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 /> This showed him that making movies is "a job that people do, that it's not just this piece of magic that happens."<ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 />

Jason described his childhood self as "a loser... a movie geek... [and] shy."<ref name=RobertEbert-Juno-2007>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title="Juno's" Reitman on Ellen Page: "She's the real thing.

== Film career ==
Reitman started out making short films during his time at USC.<ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 /> Throughout his 20s, instead of accepting offers to make commercial feature films, Reitman began making his own short films and directing commercials. Although he was offered the opportunity to direct ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]'' on two separate occasions, he declined.<ref name=RobertEbert-Juno-2007 />

Reitman's first feature film, ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'', opened in 2006. Reitman developed the [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]] novel into a screenplay and, eventually, a film.  The film was a commercial and critical success. It grossed over $39 million worldwide by the end of its run, and was nominated for two [[Golden Globes]].  After the success of ''Thank You for Smoking'', Reitman mentioned in an interview that his next film would be adapting another book (a "white collar satire") into a film. He also mentioned that he had plans to work with Buckley again on an original project.<ref name="ignore">Wines, Shawn. "[http://ignoremagazine.com/features/tobacco_road/index.html Lobbying is Kind of Funny]", ''Ignore Magazine'', 2006. Retrieved on January 10, 2008.</ref> Although the first of these projects would eventually become ''[[Up in the Air (2009 film)|Up in the Air]]'', this second project has not come to fruition.

His second film, ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'', generated great buzz after it premiered at the 2007 [[Toronto Film Festival]]<ref name=Evans2007>{{Citation

It  was [[Roger Ebert]]'s favorite film of 2007 and received Oscar nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Ellen Page]]'s performance as the title character, [[Diablo Cody]]'s original screenplay, and Reitman himself for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. Reitman did win other awards for his work on ''Juno'', including Best Director at the [[Canadian Comedy Awards#2008|2008 Canadian Comedy Awards]]; he was also honored with the "[[Cinema for Peace]] Award 2008 for Most Valuable Work of Director, Producers & Screenwriter". The film grossed over $140 million at the U.S. box office, making it the largest success of Reitman's career and more successful than any of his father's films since ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]''.<ref>"[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=juno.htm Juno - Box Office Mojo]", ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'', 2007-01-03.

In March 2006, Reitman formed the production company "Hard C Productions" with producing partner [[Daniel Dubiecki]]. The company had an overall deal with [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the company that distributed Reitman's first two films.   Reitman described his production company's goal as being to produce "small subversive comedy that is independent but accessible".<ref name="bonzai">Kit, Borys and Nicole Sperling.

Retrieved on January 4, 2008.</ref> Through Hard C Productions, Reitman is set to produce and direct ''Banzai Shadowhands'', a comedy about "a once-great ninja who is now living a life of mediocrity". ''Shadowhands'' will be written by ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'''s [[Rainn Wilson]]. Reitman met Wilson on the set of his father's film ''[[My Super Ex-Girlfriend]]'', in which Wilson had a supporting role.<ref name="bonzai" /> No start date for filming has been set, and it is unclear as to whether or not Wilson is finished with the script.

Hard C Productions produced films ''The Ornate Anatomy of Living Things'' and ''[[Jennifer's Body]]''.  ''Anatomy'' has been written by Matthew Spicer and Max Winkler, and will revolve around "a Gotham bookstore clerk who discovers a museum devoted to his life".<ref>Garrett, Diane and Peter Gilstrap. "[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117964920.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 Searchlight interested in 'Anatomy']", ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 2007-05-14.

In 2001, the year the novel ''[[Up in the Air (novel)|Up in the Air]]'' was published, [[Sheldon Turner]] discovered the book and wrote a screenplay adaptation, which he sold to DreamWorks in 2003. Jason Reitman later came upon the novel (initially attracted by the [[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]] [[blurb]] on the cover) while browsing in the [[Los Angeles]] bookstore [[Book Soup]].<ref name="VR1118012459">{{cite news | last = D'Alessandro | first = Anthony | title = Reitman on origins of 'Air': Pic inspired by Buckley quote in book | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2009-12-09 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118012459.html?categoryId=3537&cs=1 | accessdate = 2009-12-09 }}</ref><ref name="wrap012510">{{cite news | last = Pond | first = Steve | title = 'Up in the Air' Holds a Damage-Control Screening | work = [[The Wrap]] | date = 2010-01-25 | url = http://www.thewrap.com/ind-column/air-holds-damage-control-screening-13493 | accessdate = 2010-01-29}}</ref> Reitman persuaded his father [[Ivan Reitman]] to purchase the book's film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from [[Ted Griffin|Ted and Nicholas Griffin]], who used some elements from Turner's script in their own work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the elements from the Griffins' script that had (unbeknownst to Reitman) originated with Turner. Some of Turner's inventions that were utilized in the final film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech ("Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're sitting right now..."), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as male).<ref name="wrap012510"/><ref name="LAT 2010-01-15">{{cite news | last = Zeitchik | first = Steven | title = Screenwriting credits, floating up in the air | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2010-01-15 | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/01/james-cameron-jason-reitman-anthony-minghella-avatar.html | accessdate = 2010-01-16 }}</ref>
[[File:JasonReitman09TIFF.jpg|thumb|right|Reitman at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, and later admitted to being confused when the [[Writers Guild of America]] ruled that he should share credit with Turner. He and Turner later appeared at a WGA event where both said they were happy to share credit now that the course of events, and Turner's contribution to the final product, had been made clear.<ref name="wrap012510"/><ref name="LAT 2010-01-15"/>

In the spring of 2009, Reitman directed ''[[Up in the Air (2009 film)|Up in the Air]]'' starring [[George Clooney]]. ''Up in the Air'' is based on a novel written by [[Walter Kirn]] about a corporate downsizer who travels from city to city and is fanatical about collecting his ten millionth frequent flier mile. The film features real-world characters cast from the ranks of the recently downsized. "Hidden within a film that seems to be about corporate termination and the economy is a movie about the decision whether to be alone or not," noted Reitman,"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Jason%20Reitman%3A%20Up%20In%20The%20Air/ |title = Jason Reitman: Up In The Air |publisher = [[SuicideGirls.com]] |date = 23 Dec 2009 |accessdate = 2009-12-23 }}</ref> in an interview conducted just prior to the film's nationwide release. Sheldon Turner and Reitman's ''Up in the Air'' screenplay won the Golden Globe Award for best screenplay in 2010.

Reitman also executively produced the erotic thriller ''[[Chloe (film)|Chloe]]'', theatrically released by [[Sony Pictures Classics]] on March 26, 2010.<ref name="boxofficemojo.com">http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=chloe.htm</ref> Reitman helped persuade [[Amanda Seyfried]] to star in the film.<ref>http://www.screendaily.com/reports/interviews/the-great-entertainer/5006120.article</ref> The film had enjoyed commercial success and became director [[Atom Egoyan]]'s biggest moneymaker ever.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/article/901059--the-digital-revolution-film | location=Toronto | work= The Star | first=Geoff | last=Pevere | title=The Digital Revolution: Part 1 | date=December 7, 2010}}</ref>

=== Other work ===
Before his feature film career began, Jason Reitman wrote and directed six short films. He financed his first short film, "Operation", with money he made by selling ads in desk calendars.  The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1998.<ref name="advocates">"[http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/jason-reitman.html Jason Reitman - Libertarian]", ''Advocates of Self Government'', 2006. Retrieved on January 10, 2008.</ref>

He was a guest on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' on April 10, 2008; when he was asked if he would direct ''[[Ghostbusters III]]'' and cast Howard, he said "Do you know how many times I get asked if I want to do ''Ghostbusters III''?  Looking at my career so far, I mean, if you just looked at my two films, I would make the most boring ''Ghostbusters'' movie.  It would just be people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it."  Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also revealed that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of ''[[Son of the Beach]]'' (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of ''[[Baywatch]]''), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' at the time.

Reitman produced and directed the 2007 holiday season commercials for [[Wal-Mart]] with advertising agency [[Bernstein-Rein]]. He has also directed ads for [[Burger King]], [[Nintendo]], [[BMW]], and [[Buick]].<ref name="advocates" /> In television, Reitman directed two episodes of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' entitled "[[Local Ad]]" and "[[Frame Toby]]". Reitman also directed a three-part pretaped sketch for the NBC show ''Saturday Night Live'' called "Death By Chocolate," about a walking candy bar (played by episode host [[Ashton Kutcher]]) who murders people (stabbing a homeless man, shooting a doctor, cutting off a life support machine on a coma victim, and slicing [[Andy Samberg]] [dressed as a lumberjack] with a chainsaw).

Since 2011, Rietman directs the ''[[Live Read]]'' series, a monthly live staged reading of film scripts as part of the Film Independent at [[LACMA]].<ref name="LiveRead">{{cite web|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|title=Jason Reitman’s "Live Read"|url=http://www.departures.com/articles/jason-reitmans-live-read|publisher=Departure|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
When Reitman was 16 and still in high school he moved in with a woman 10 years his senior. They were together for 7 years until they separated.<ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 />

In 2000, when he was 23, Reitman met and fell in love with his next door neighbor, eventually marrying writer Michele Lee,<ref>{{IMDb name|1317905|section=bio|Michele Lee}}</ref> with whom he co-wrote the 2004 comedic short "Consent."<ref>{{IMDb title|402936|Consent}}</ref> They have one child, a daughter named Josie, born in 2006.<ref name=NYDailyNews-2011>{{cite web|last=Steinman|first=Alex|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-06-22/gossip/29710667_1_divorce-papers-irreconcilable-differences-ghostbusters|title='Up in the Air' director Jason Reitman files for divorce from wife Michele Lee|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=June 22, 2011|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref> After being together 10 years, Reitman filed for divorce from his wife in June 2011 and stated he was divorced as of 2014.<ref name=WTF-Maron-2014 /><ref name=NYDailyNews-2011 />
