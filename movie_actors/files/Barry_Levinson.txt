==Career==
Levinson's first writing work was for [[variety show]]s such as ''The [[Marty Feldman]] Comedy Machine'', ''The Lohman and Barkley Show'', ''[[The Tim Conway Show (1970 TV series)|The Tim Conway Show]]'', and ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]''. After some success as a screenwriter – notably the [[Mel Brooks]] comedies ''[[Silent Movie]]'' (1976) and ''[[High Anxiety]]'' (1977) (in which he played a bellboy) and the Oscar-nominated script (co-written by then-wife [[Valerie Curtin]]) ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]'' (1979) – Levinson began his career as a director with ''[[Diner (film)|Diner]]'' (1982), for which he had also written the script and which earned him an Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award For Best Original Screenplay|Best Screenplay]].

''Diner'' was the first of a series of films set in the [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] of Levinson's youth. The others were ''[[Tin Men]]'' (1987), a story of aluminum-siding salesmen in the 1960s starring [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Danny DeVito]]; the immigrant family saga ''[[Avalon (1990 film)|Avalon]]'' (which featured [[Elijah Wood]] in one of his earliest screen appearances), and ''[[Liberty Heights]]'' (1999).

His biggest hit, both critically and financially, was ''[[Rain Man]]'' (1988), a sibling drama starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Tom Cruise]] (Levinson appeared in a cameo as a doctor). The film won four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]]. It also won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[39th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale 1989">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1989/03_preistr_ger_1989/03_Preistraeger_1989.html |title=Berlinale: 1989 Prize Winners |accessdate=2011-03-13 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>
