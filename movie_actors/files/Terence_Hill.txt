At one time among Italy's highest paid actors,{{when?|date=May 2015}} Hill's most widely seen films include comic and standard ''Westerns all´Italiana'' ("Italian style Westerns," colloquially, "[[spaghetti western]]s"), some based on popular novels by German author [[Karl May]] about the [[American West]].  Of these, the most famous are ''Lo chiamavano Trinità'' (''[[They Call Me Trinity]]'', 1971) and ''Il mio nome è Nessuno'' (''[[My Name Is Nobody]]'', 1973), co-starring [[Henry Fonda]]. His film "Django, Prepare the coffin," shot in 1968 by director [[Ferdinando Baldi]], and co-starring [[Horst Frank]] and [[George Eastman]], was featured at the ''64a La Biennale di Venezia'' (64th [[Venice Film Festival]]) in 2007. Hill, whose stage name was the product of a publicity stunt by film producers, also went on to a successful television career in Italy, including the long running lead and title role of ''[[Don Matteo]]'' (2000-), about an inspirational [[parish]] [[priest]] who assists the [[Carabinieri]] in solving crimes local to his community, a role for which Hill received an international "Outstanding Actor of the Year" award at the ''Festival de Télévision de Monte-Carlo 42e'' ([[Monte-Carlo Television Festival|42nd Monte Carlo Television Festival]]).

I Don't!]]'' (''Dio perdona... Io no!'', 1968). His film "Django, Prepare the coffin" was also shot in 1968, by director [[Ferdinando Baldi]]; it co-starred [[Horst Frank]] and [[George Eastman]] (and would be featured, much later, at the ''64a La Biennale di Venezia'' (64th [[Venice Film Festival]], in 2007).<ref name=Naldi07>Paola Naldi, 2007, "Il nuovo cinema cerca gloria," at ''[[La Repubblica]] [Bologna]'' (online), August 29, 2007, see [http://bologna.repubblica.it/dettaglio/il-nuovo-cinema-cerca-gloria/1358796] and [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=it&u=http://bologna.repubblica.it/dettaglio/il-nuovo-cinema-cerca-gloria/1358796&prev=search], accessed 11 May 2015.

Hill changed his name from to Terence Hill the same year, a name made up as a publicity stunt by the film producers; he had to choose from a list of twenty names and picked the one with his mother's initials.{{cn|date=May 2015}} In a question and answer session, he dismissed as a journalist's invention the rumor that it might have been taken from the Roman playwright [[Terence]] and his wife's surname.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terencehill.it/fc/avv_fattadavoi.html |title=Fatta da voi...

Possibly their most famous film is the 1971 western ''Lo chiamavano Trinità'' (''[[They Call Me Trinity]]'') and the 1972 sequel ''Continuavano a chiamarlo Trinità'' (''[[Trinity Is STILL My Name!]]'').{{cn|date=May 2015}} Hill has stated in interviews that ''Il mio nome è Nessuno'' (''[[My Name Is Nobody]]'', 1973), in which he co-starred with [[Henry Fonda]], is his personal favorite of all his films.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

His first American films were ''[[Mr. Billion]]'' and ''[[March or Die (film)|March or Die]]'' (both 1977), after which he divided his time between Italy and the US.{{cn|date=May 2015}} Hill later went on to a successful television career in Italy; in 2000, he landed the leading role in the Italian television series ''[[Don Matteo]]'', about an inspirational [[parish]] [[priest]] who assists the [[Carabinieri]] in solving crimes local to his community.{{cn|date=May 2015}} This role earned Hill an international "Outstanding Actor of the Year" award at the ''Festival de Télévision de Monte-Carlo 42e'' ([[Monte-Carlo Television Festival|42nd Monte Carlo Television Festival]]), alongside ones for the series, and for producer [[Alessandro Jacchia]] at that festival.<ref>Jeri Jacquin, 2014, "Don Matteo: Season 7 & 8 from MHz International Mystery, " at ''Imperial Beach Patch'' (online), October 8, 2014, see [https://patch.com/california/imperialbeach/don-matteo-season-7-8-mhz-international-mystery], accessed 11 May 2015.{{better source|date=May 2015}}</ref>{{better source|date=May 2015}}
