'''Pierce Brendan Brosnan''', (born 16 May 1953) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] actor, film producer and environmentalist who after leaving [[comprehensive school]] at age 16, began training in commercial illustration. He then went on to train at the [[Drama Centre]] in London for three years. Following a stage acting career he rose to popularity in the television series ''[[Remington Steele]]'' (1982–87), which blended the genres of romantic comedy, drama, and detective procedural.

After ''Remington Steele'', Brosnan appeared in films such as the [[Cold War]] spy film ''[[The Fourth Protocol (film)|The Fourth Protocol]]'' (1987) and the comedy ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993). In 1994, he became the fifth actor to portray secret agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] in the [[Eon Productions]] [[James Bond in film|film series]], starring in four films between 1995 and 2002 (''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' and ''[[Die Another Day]]''). He lent his likeness for Bond in the video games ''[[James Bond 007: Nightfire]]'' and ''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing]]'', providing his voice too for the latter. During this period, he also took the lead in other films such as the epic disaster adventure film ''[[Dante's Peak]]'' (1997) and the remake of the heist film ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1999). After leaving the role of Bond, he has starred in such films as the dark comedy ''[[The Matador]]'' (2005), which was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]], the musical/romantic comedy ''[[Mamma Mia! (film)|Mamma Mia!]]'' (2008), which won a [[National Movie Award]], and the [[Roman Polanski]]-directed political thriller ''[[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]]'' (2010).

In 1996, along with Beau St. Clair, Brosnan formed ''Irish DreamTime'', a Los Angeles-based production company. In later years, he has become known for his charitable work and environmental activism. He was married to [[Australia]]n actress [[Cassandra Harris]] from 1980 until her death in 1991. He married American journalist and author [[Keely Shaye Smith]] in 2001, and he became an American citizen in 2004.

== Early life ==
Brosnan was born in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in [[Drogheda]], [[County Louth]],<!-- -DO NOT CHANGE the birthplace without a reliable source --><ref name = "Brosnansite"/> Ireland, the only child of Thomas Brosnan, a carpenter, and May (née Smith, born circa 1934). He lived in [[Navan]], [[County Meath]] for 12 years and considers it his hometown.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/1999/1111/brosnan.html|title=Pierce Brosnan honoured by Navan Town|publisher=RTÉ News | date=11 November 1999}}</ref>
Brosnan's father abandoned the family when Pierce was an infant. When he was four years old, his mother moved to London to work as a nurse. From that point on, he was largely brought up by his grandparents, Philip and Kathleen Smith. After their deaths, he lived with an aunt and then an uncle, but was subsequently sent to live in a boarding house run by a woman named Eileen. He was educated at Elliott School, a state comprehensive school in south west London.<ref name="Aficionado"/>

According to Brosnan,
{{quote|Childhood was fairly solitary. I grew up in a very small town called Navan in County Meath. I never knew my father. He left when I was an infant and I was left in the care of my mother and my grandparents. To be Catholic in the '50s, and to be [[Irish Catholic]] in the '50s, and have a marriage which was not there, a father who was not there, consequently, the mother, the wife suffered greatly. My mother was very courageous. She took the bold steps to go away and be a nurse in England. Basically wanting a better life for her and myself.

In 1982, Brosnan moved to [[Southern California]] and rose to popularity in the United States playing the title role in the [[NBC]] romantic detective series ''[[Remington Steele]]''.<ref Name = "Brosnansite"/><ref name="actors"/> The ''[[Washington Post]]'' noted that same year that Brosnan "could make it as a young James Bond."<ref name="klast">{{cite journal|url=http://www.klast.net/bond/pb_road.html|title=Pierce Brosnan's Long and Winding Road To Bond| journal=007 Magazine|accessdate=22 February 2007|last=Last|first=Kimberly|year=1996}}</ref> After ''Remington Steele'' ended in 1987, Brosnan went on to appear in several films, including ''[[The Fourth Protocol (film)|The Fourth Protocol]]'' (1987), a [[Cold War]] thriller in which he starred alongside [[Michael Caine]], ''[[The Deceivers]]'' and [[James Clavell]]'s ''[[Noble House]]'' both in (1988), and ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'' (1992).

=== James Bond (1994–2005) ===
Brosnan first met James Bond films  producer [[Albert R. Broccoli]] on the sets of ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' because his first wife, [[Cassandra Harris]], starred as Countess Lisl von Schlaf, mistress to Milos Columbo. Broccoli said, "if he can act&nbsp;... he's my guy" to inherit the role of Bond from [[Roger Moore]].<ref name="klast" /> It was reported by both ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and the ''[[National Enquirer]],'' that Brosnan was going to inherit another role of Moore's, that of [[Simon Templar]] in ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]''.<ref name="klast" /> Brosnan denied the rumours in July 1993 but added, "it's still languishing there on someone's desk in Hollywood."<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Orange Coast|title=Pierce Brosnan: Urbane Leading Man|last=Belson|first=Eve |date=July 1993}}</ref>

In 1987, [[NBC]] cancelled ''Remington Steele'' and Brosnan was offered the role as James Bond, but the publicity revived ''Remington Steele''. His contract with the ''Remington Steele'' producers required him to resume his role and he regretfully declined the Bond role.<ref name="klast" /> The producers instead hired [[Timothy Dalton]] for ''[[The Living Daylights]]'' (1987), and ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' (1989).<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Broccoli|first1=Albert R|last2=Zec|first2=Donald|authorlink1=Albert R.

Legal squabbles between the Bond producers and the studio over distribution rights resulted in the cancellation of a proposed third Dalton film in 1991<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chapman|first=James|title=Licence to Thrill: A Cultural History of the James Bond Films|year=2000|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-231-12048-7|page=247}}</ref> and put the Bond series on a hiatus for several years. After the legal issues had been resolved, Dalton decided not to return for a third film. On 7 June 1994, Brosnan was announced as the fifth actor to play Bond.<ref name="klast" />

Brosnan was signed for a three-film Bond deal with the option of a fourth. The first, 1995's ''[[GoldenEye]]'', grossed US $350&nbsp;million worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=goldeneye.htm|title = GoldenEye|accessdate =15 November 2006|publisher = [[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> the fourth highest worldwide gross of any film in 1995,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=1995&p=.htm|title = 1995 Worldwide Grosses|accessdate =24 November 2006|work= [[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> making it the most successful Bond film since ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', adjusted for inflation.<ref name="nos">{{cite web|url =http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/JamesBond.php|title =Box Office History for James Bond Movies|accessdate =18 October 2007|work =The Numbers|publisher= Nash Information Service}}</ref>  It holds an 80% [[Rotten Tomatoes|Rotten tomato]] rating,<ref name="rt">{{cite web|work=rottentomatoes.com|title=GoldenEye (1995)|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/goldeneye/|accessdate=16 November 2006}}</ref> while ''[[Metacritic]]'' holds it at 65%.<ref name="mc">{{cite web|work=metacritic.com|title=GoldenEye|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/goldeneye|accessdate=24 November 2006}}</ref> In the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3 stars out of 4, saying that Brosnan's Bond was "somehow more sensitive, more vulnerable, more psychologically complete" than the previous ones, also commenting on Bond's "loss of innocence" since previous films.<ref>{{cite news|title=GoldenEye |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19951117/REVIEWS/511170303/1023 |date=17 November 1995|author= Roger Ebert |work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=16 November 2006}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] described Brosnan as "a decided improvement over his immediate predecessor" with a "flair for wit to go along with his natural charm", but added that "fully one-quarter of ''Goldeneye'' is momentum-killing padding."<ref>{{cite web|title=GoldenEye |work=reelviews.net|url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/g/goldeneye.html  |year= 1995|accessdate=16 November 2006|author=James Berardinelli}}</ref>

In 1996, Brosnan formed a film production company entitled "Irish DreamTime" along with producing partner and long time friend Beau St. Clair.<ref Name = "Brosnansite"/> Three years later the company's first studio project, ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', was released and met both critical and box office success.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.piercebrosnan.com/menu.php?mm=5&sm=1&pn=1| title=Bio Basics| journal=The official Pierce Brosnan site|publisher=PBFC| accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref>

Brosnan returned in 1997's ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' and 1999's ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', which were also successful. In 2002, Brosnan appeared for his fourth time as Bond in ''[[Die Another Day]]'', receiving mixed reviews but was a success at the box office. Brosnan himself subsequently criticised many aspects of his fourth Bond movie. During the promotion, he mentioned that he would like to continue his role as James Bond: "I'd like to do another, sure. [[Sean Connery|Connery]] did six. Six would be a number, then never come back."<ref name="Numero">{{cite journal|title=Numero Uno (Die Another Day cover story)|journal=Empire|date=December 2002|first=Ian|last=Nathon|issue=162|page=103}}</ref> Brosnan asked [[Eon Productions]], when accepting the role, to be allowed to work on other projects between Bond films. The request was granted, and for every Bond film, Brosnan appeared in at least two other mainstream films, including several he produced,<ref name="ie18284"/> playing a wide range of roles, ranging from a scientist in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'', to the title role in ''[[Grey Owl (film)|Grey Owl]]'' which documents the life of Englishman [[Archibald Stansfeld Belaney]], one of Canada's first conservationists.

Shortly after the release of ''Die Another Day,'' the media began questioning whether or not Brosnan would reprise the role for a fifth time. At that time, Brosnan was approaching his 50th birthday. Brosnan kept in mind that both fans and critics were very unhappy with [[Roger Moore]] playing the role until he (Moore) was 58, but he was receiving popular support from both critics and the franchise fanbase for a fifth instalment. For this reason, he remained enthusiastic about reprising his role.<ref name="bbc1">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3592361.stm|title=Brosnan uncertain over more Bond|publisher=BBC NEWS|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=2 April 2004}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Brosnan married twice, was widowed once and has five children and three grandchildren as of 2015.<ref>[http://www.grandmagazine.com/news/2011/09/pierce-brosnan-why-is-this-man-average/ Pierce Brosnan grandchildren]</ref>

Brosnan met Australian actress [[Cassandra Harris]] through her stepson David Harris, one of [[Richard Harris]]' nephews, in 1977, shortly after he left drama school.<ref Name = "Brosnansite"/> On meeting her, he has described his feelings, saying, "What a beautiful looking woman. I never for an instant thought she was someone I'd spend 17 years of my life with. I didn't think of wooing her, or attempting to woo her; I just wanted to enjoy her beauty and who she was."<ref name="Aficionado"/> They began dating, and eventually bought  a house in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]]. They married on 27 December 1980 and had one son together, Sean, who was born on 13 September 1983. They lived with her children, Charlotte (1971-2013) and [[Chris Brosnan|Christopher]], and after their father Dermot Harris died in 1986, he adopted them and they took the surname Brosnan.<ref Name = "Brosnansite"/><ref name="independentonline">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/pierce-brosnan-a-new-licence-to-thrill-525881.html|title=Pierce Brosnan: A new licence to thrill |work=The Independent |accessdate=19 February 2007|last=Lipworth|first=Elaine|date=17 February 2006|location=London}}</ref>

Brosnan supplemented his income by working in West End productions and in a television film about Irish horse racing.<ref name="Aficionado"/> After Harris appeared in the James Bond film ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' in 1981, they secured a bank loan and moved to southern California where Brosnan secured a role in the TV series ''Remington Steele,'' easing their financial worries.

An episode of ''Remington Steele'' that was filmed in Ireland generated significant publicity. One outcome was that Brosnan met his father, who had left when Brosnan was an infant, in a brief get-together at his hotel. Brosnan said he expected to see a very tall man, but described his father as "a man of medium stature, pushed-back silver hair, flinty eyes and a twizzled jaw. He had a very strong [[County Kerry|Kerry]] accent."<ref name="Aficionado"/>  Brosnan was regretful that they met under such public circumstances. He said he would have preferred more private arrangements that would have given him the opportunity to speak privately with his father.<ref name="Aficionado"/>

While filming ''[[The Deceivers (film)|The Deceivers]]'' in [[Rajasthan]], India, in 1987, Brosnan's wife Harris became seriously ill. She was later diagnosed with [[ovarian cancer]] and died on 28 December 1991 at age 43.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D8133CF932A05751C1A967958260|title=Cassandra Harris, Actress, 39|accessdate=19 February 2007|work=The New York Times|date=31 December 1991}}</ref> Brosnan struggled to cope with her cancer and death. "When your partner gets cancer, then life changes. Your timetable and reference for your normal routines and the way you view life, all this changes. Because you're dealing with death. You're dealing with the possibility of death and dying. And it was that way through the [[chemotherapy]], through the first-look operation, the second look, the third look, the fourth look, the fifth look. Cassie was very positive about life. I mean, she had the most amazing energy and outlook on life. It was and is a terrible loss, and I see it reflected, from time to time, in my children."<ref name="Aficionado"/> Harris had always wanted Brosnan to play the role of James Bond, and in 1995, four years after her death, Brosnan was given the role in ''[[GoldenEye]]''.

In 1994, Brosnan met American journalist [[Keely Shaye Smith]] in Mexico. They were married in 2001 at [[Ballintubber Abbey]] in [[County Mayo]], Ireland.<ref Name = "Brosnansite"/> They have two sons together, Dylan Thomas Brosnan (born 13 January 1997) and [[Paris Beckett Brosnan]] (born 27 February 2001).<ref>[http://www.foodworldnews.com/articles/11401/20141215/pierce-brosnan-son-james-bond-dylan-brosnan.htm"Pierce Brosnan’s Son, Dylan, Is A Model"] foodworldnews.com</ref>

On 23 September 2004, Brosnan became a citizen of the United States, but retained his Irish citizenship. Brosnan said that "my Irishness is in everything I do. It's the spirit of who I am, as a man, an actor, a father. It's where I come from."<ref name="Numero"/> Brosnan was asked by a fan if it annoyed him when people get his nationality confused. He said: "It amuses me in some respects that they should confuse me with an Englishman when I'm dyed-in-the-wool, born and bred Irishman&nbsp;... I don't necessarily fly under any flag. But no, it doesn't bother me."<ref>{{cite journal|title=Public Access: Pierce Brosnan|journal=Empire|first=Ian|last=Nathan|issue=135|page=10}}</ref> <!-- -He currently resides primarily in [[Malibu, California]] and has homes in Hawaii, North [[Dublin]], and [[Meath]].- -->

Brosnan has expressed contempt for his education by the Christian Brothers.<ref name="Aficionado"/> However in 2013 he commented, "It always helps to have a bit of prayer in your back pocket. At the end of the day, you have to have something and for me that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith... God has been good to me. My faith has been good to me in the moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." <ref>[http://www.irishcentral.com/ent/Pierce-Brosnan-talks-about-his-deep-Catholic-faith-118983269.html "Pierce Brosnan talks about his deep Catholic faith"] ''Irish Central''.  31 March 2011,</ref> Brosnan attends [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said "I also love the teachings of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy. It's my own private faith.
