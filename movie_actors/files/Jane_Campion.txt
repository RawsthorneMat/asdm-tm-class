She graduated with a bachelor's degree in painting at the [[Sydney College of the Arts]] in Australia in 1979.

In 1981 she began studying at the [[Australian Film, Television and Radio School]], where she made several more short films, and graduated in 1984.<ref>Mark Stiles, "Jane Campion", ''Cinema Papers'', December 1985 p434-435, 471</ref>

== Career ==

Her first short film, ''[[Peel (film)|Peel]]'' (1982) won the [[Short Film Palme d'Or]] at the [[1986 Cannes Film Festival]],<ref>[http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/1986/awardCompetition.html Awards - 1986], Cannes Film Festival. Retrieved 13 May 2010.</ref> and other awards followed for the shorts ''[[Passionless Moments]]'' (1983), ''[[A Girl's Own Story]]'' (1984) and ''After Hours'' (1984).
Having left the Australian Film and Television School she directed an episode for ABC's light entertainment series ''Dancing Daze'' (1986), which led to her first TV film, ''Two Friends'' (1986) produced by Jan Chapman.

''[[Sweetie (film)|Sweetie]]'' (1989) was her feature debut, and won international awards. Further recognition followed with ''[[An Angel at My Table]]'' (1990), a biographical and psychological portrayal of the New Zealand poet [[Janet Frame]]. International recognition followed with another Palme d'Or at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]] for ''The Piano'',<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2567/year/1993.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Piano |accessdate=2009-08-22|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> which won the best director award from the [[Australian Film Institute]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] in 1994. At the [[66th Academy Awards]], she was the second woman ever to be nominated for Best Director.

Campion's work since that time has tended to polarize opinion.  ''[[The Portrait of a Lady (film)|The Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1996), based on the [[Henry James]] novel, featured [[Nicole Kidman]], [[John Malkovich]], [[Barbara Hershey]] and [[Martin Donovan]]. ''[[Holy Smoke!]]'' (1999) teamed Campion again with [[Harvey Keitel]], this time with [[Kate Winslet]] as the female lead.  ''[[In the Cut]]'' (2003), an [[erotic thriller]] based on [[Susanna Moore]]'s bestseller, provided [[Meg Ryan]] an opportunity to depart from her more familiar onscreen persona.  Her 2009 film ''[[Bright Star (film)|Bright Star]],'' a biographical drama about poet [[John Keats]] (played by [[Ben Whishaw]]) and his lover [[Fanny Brawne]] ([[Abbie Cornish]]), was shown at the Cannes Film Festival.

Campion was an executive producer for the 2006 documentary ''[[Abduction: The Megumi Yokota Story]]'' and has worked on the serial ''[[Top of the Lake]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jane-campion-write-direct-sundance-257675 |title=Jane Campion to Write, Direct Sundance Channel Miniseries Starring Elisabeth Moss |last=Guthrie |first=Marisa |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2011-11-04 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}</ref> The mini-series received near universal acclaim <ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/top-of-the-lake/</ref><ref>http://www.metacritic.com/tv/top-of-the-lake</ref> with its lead actress [[Elisabeth Moss]] winning numerous awards including a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film]] and a [[Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie/Miniseries]] as well as a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie]] nomination.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2103085/awards</ref> Campion herself was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special]].<ref>http://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2013/directing-miniseries-special</ref>

Campion responded by raising from her seat to give him a hug.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/bear-hugs-at-cannes-as-mommy-wins-jury-prize-20140525-zrndm.html</ref><ref>http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Xavier+Dolan+Jane+Campion/9874782/story.html</ref>

==Reception==
From the beginning of her career, Campion's work has received high praise from critics all around. In V.W. Wexman's ''Jane Campion: Interviews'', critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] describes Campion "as one of the best young directors in the world today."<ref>V. W. Wexman. ''Jane Campion: Interviews''. Roundhouse Publishing. 1999. ISBN 1-57806-083-4.</ref> Similarly, in Sue Gillett's "More Than Meets The Eye: The Mediation of Affects in Jane Campion's 'Sweetie'," Campion's work is described as "perhaps the fullest and truest way of being faithful to the reality of experience"; by utilizing the "unsayable" and "unseeable," she manages to catalyze audience speculation.<ref>http://sensesofcinema.com/1999/feature-articles/sweetie/. Retrieved 6 May 2012.</ref> Campion's films tend to gravitate around themes of gender politics, such as seduction and female sexual power. This has led some to label Campion's body of work as feminist, however, Rebecca Flint Marx argues, "while not inaccurate, [the feminist label] fails to fully capture the dilemmas of her characters and the depth of her work."<ref>http://movies.nytimes.com/person/83988/Jane-Campion/biography.Retrieved 6 May 2012.</ref>
