==Early life==
[[File:Errol Flynn at South West London College (1923).jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|Errol Flynn at South West London College  aged 14 (1923)]]
Flynn was born in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], where his father, [[Theodore Thomson Flynn]], was a lecturer (1909) and later professor (1911) of biology at the [[University of Tasmania]]. Flynn was born at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Battery Point. His mother was born Lily Mary Young, but dropped the first names Lily Mary shortly after she was married and changed her name to Marelle.<ref>Flynn always calls her Marelle in his autobiography.</ref> Flynn described his mother's family as ''"seafaring folk"''<ref>Flynn, ''My Wicked, Wicked Ways'', p.33.</ref> and this appears to be where his lifelong interest in boats and the sea originated.

==Career==

===Early career===
In early 1933, Flynn appeared as an amateur actor in the Australian film ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'', in the lead role of [[Fletcher Christian]]. Later that year he headed back to England intent upon pursuing a career in acting, and shortly after arriving secured a job with the [[Northampton]] [[Repertory]] Company at the town's Royal Theatre (now part of [[Royal & Derngate]]), where he worked and received his training as a professional actor for seven months. (Northampton's art-house cinema, the Errol Flynn Filmhouse, is named after him).<ref name="northamptonchron">{{cite web|url=http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/lifestyle/film/new-art-house-cinema-to-be-named-after-hollywood-legend-errol-flynn-1-4890147|title=New art-house cinema to be named after Hollywood legend Errol Flynn – Northampton Chronicle and Echo|publisher=northamptonchron.co.uk|accessdate=2014-02-20}}</ref> He also performed at the 1934 [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] Festival and in [[Glasgow]] and London's West End fleetingly.<ref name = "Connelly">{{Cite book| author=Connelly, Gerry| title=Errol Flynn in Northampton| year=1998 | publisher=Domra Publications| isbn=978-0-9524417-2-4  }}</ref>

In 1934, Flynn was dismissed from Northampton Rep. after a violent fracas with a female stage manager, which involved her being tumbled down a stairwell, and he headed to [[Warner Brothers]]' [[Teddington Studios]] in [[Middlesex]] where he had worked briefly as an [[extra (actor)|extra]] in the movie ''I Adore You'' before going to Northampton.<ref>Connelly, Gerry (1998) 'Errol Flynn in Northampton'</ref> With his new-found acting skills he was cast as the lead in ''[[Murder at Monte Carlo]]'' (currently a [[lost film]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/nationalarchive/news/mostwanted/murder-at-monte-carlo.html |title=Murder at Monte Carlo &#124; BFI Most Wanted BFI National Archive |publisher=BFI |date=23 December 2010 |accessdate=18 February 2012}}</ref> during the filming of which he was signed by Warner Bros. and emigrated to America as a contract actor.

===Hollywood career===
[[File:Santa Fe Trail De Havilland Flynn.jpg|right|thumb|200px|with [[Olivia de Havilland]] in ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' (1940)]]
Flynn was an overnight sensation in his first starring role soon after arriving in Hollywood,<ref>Caterson, Simon, "Errol Flynn, man in tights", On Line Opinion, 10 June 2009. Retrieved 14 June 2012 http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=9021&page=0</ref> ''[[Captain Blood (1935 film)|Captain Blood]]'' (1935). Quickly typecast as a swashbuckler, he followed it with a succession of films over the next six years that re-invented the sophistication of the action-adventure genre, most of them under the direction of [[Michael Curtiz]], viz., ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936 film)|The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1936),''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1937 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'' (1937), ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1938; his first [[Technicolor]] film), ''[[The Dawn Patrol (1938 film)|The Dawn Patrol]]'' (1938), ''[[Dodge City (1939 movie)|Dodge City]]'' (1939), ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939) and  ''[[The Sea Hawk (1940 film)|The Sea Hawk]]'' (1940).

Working throughout his career with a cross-section of Hollywood's best fight arrangers, Flynn became noted for his fast-paced sword fights as seen in ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'', ''The Sea Hawk'' and ''Captain Blood''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2009/05/15/32184-torn-exclusive-with-reclaiming-the-blade-director/ |title=TheOneRing.net, TORn exclusive with 'Reclaiming The Blade,' Director, May 15, 2009 by MrCere |publisher=Theonering.net |date=15 May 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> He also showed an acting range beyond purely action-adventure roles, both at light contemporary social comedy via performances in ''[[The Perfect Specimen]]'' (1937) and ''[[Four's a Crowd]]'' (1938), and melodrama in ''[[The Sisters (1938 film)|The Sisters]]'' (1938).

Flynn co-starred with [[Olivia de Havilland]] a total of eight times, and together they made the most successful on-screen romantic partnership in Hollywood in the late 1930s-early '40s in ''Captain Blood'' (1935), ''[[The Charge of the Light Brigade]]'' (1936), ''The Adventures of Robin Hood'' (1938), ''Four's a Crowd'' (1938), ''Dodge City'' (1939), ''The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex'' (1939), ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'' (1940), and ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' (1941). While Flynn acknowledged his personal attraction to de Havilland, assertions by film historians that they were privately romantically involved during the filming of ''Robin Hood''<ref>Rudy Behlmer in the Special Edition release of ''Robin Hood'' (2003)</ref> have been refuted by de Havilland. In an interview for [[Turner Classic Movies]] she said that their relationship was platonic, primarily because Flynn was already married to [[Lili Damita]].

[[File:Bette Davis - Errol Flynn.jpg|left|thumb|200px|with [[Bette Davis]] in ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939)]]
During the shooting of ''The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex'' (1939) Flynn was co-starred for a second time with [[Bette Davis]], but their personal relationship was quarrelsome offscreen, causing Davis allegedly to slap him across the face far harder than necessary while filming a scene. Flynn thought that the cause of Davis' wrath was her being romantically interested in him, a feeling that was not reciprocated on his part.<ref name="Flynn, Errol 1959">Flynn, Errol (1959) 'My Wicked, Wicked Ways'</ref> Other reports said Davis was upset to be sharing equal billing with a man she thought was not a real actor but just playing the same dashing adventurer time after time. Olivia de Havilland recounted a story where she visited Davis and they watched a private copy of Elizabeth and Essex; halfway through Davis brought her hand crashing down on her chair arm rest and declared, "Damn it! The man could act!"

In 1940, he was voted the fourth most popular star in the US according to Variety and the seventh most popular in Britain, and was at the zenith of his career.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47308347 |title=FILM WORLD. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=14 February 1941 |accessdate=24 April 2012 |page=16 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47309649 |title=FILM WORLD. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=21 February 1941 |accessdate=24 April 2012 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Flynn was a member of the [[Hollywood Cricket Club]] with [[David Niven]], and a talented tennis player on the California Club circuit. His suave, debonair, and devil-may-care attitude toward both women and life has been immortalised in the English language by author Benjamin S. Johnson as, "Errolesque", in his treatise on the subject, ''An Errolesque Philosophy on Life''.<ref name="errolflynn">[http://www.errolflynn.net/Library/l-mwww.htm My Wicked, Wicked Ways (essay)]</ref>

When Flynn became a [[naturalized]] American citizen on 15 August 1942 he also became eligible for the military draft, as the United States had entered [[World War&nbsp;II]] eight months earlier. Grateful to the country that had given him fame and wealth,<ref name="Basinger, Jeanine p. 247">Basinger, Jeanine: ''The Star Machine'', p. 247.</ref> he attempted to join the armed services but he had several health problems, his heart was enlarged, with a murmur, and he had already suffered at least one heart attack; he had recurrent [[malaria]] (contracted in [[New Guinea]]), chronic back pain (for which he self-medicated with morphine and later, with heroin), lingering chronic tuberculosis, and numerous venereal diseases. Flynn, famous for his athletic roles and promoted as a paragon of male physical perfection, was classified [[4F (military conscription)|4-F]] – unqualified for military service because of not meeting the minimum physical fitness standards.<ref name="Basinger, Jeanine p. 247"/><ref>Thomas, Tony ''Errol Flynn: The Spy Who Never Was''</ref> This created a public image problem for both Flynn and Warner Brothers as he was often criticized for his failure to enlist in the Armed Forces for war service as many other Hollywood actors of service age had, and yet while not apparently enlisting he continued to play war heroes in flag-waver productions such as ''[[Dive Bomber (film)|Dive Bomber]]'' (1941), ''[[Desperate Journey]]'' (1942) and ''[[Objective Burma]]'' (1945). The Studio's failure to counter the criticism was due to a decision professionally to conceal the state of Flynn's health as he was an expensive asset – in the late 1940s his fee was $200,000 a film.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55850501 |title=STAR SYSTEM 'ON THE WAY OUT'. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=14 October 1950 |accessdate=4 August 2012 |page=8 Supplement: Sunday Magazine |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

After World War II the taste of the American moviegoing audience changed from its pre-war cosmopolitan interest in European-themed material and the English history-based escapist epics that Flynn had excelled at, to more gritty urban realism and [[film noir]] reflecting modern American life, and more domestically sourced subject-matter generally. Flynn, having tried unsuccessfully to make the transition with productions like ''[[Uncertain Glory]]'' (1944) and ''[[Cry Wolf (1947 film)|Cry Wolf]]'' (1947), and backed into an artistic corner of relying on increasingly passe Westerns such as ''[[Silver River (film)|Silver River]]'' (1948) (in which he showed his frustration with increasingly disruptive behavior on set) and ''[[Montana (1950 film)|Montana]]'' (1950), found himself released from his primary Warner Bros Studio contract in 1950 by [[Jack Warner]] in a stable-clearing of 1930s glamor generation stars.<ref name="Flynn, Errol 1959"/> This essentially marked the end of Flynn's Hollywood career and the money that went with it, and his descent financially and physically after it was rapid.

===After Hollywood===
In the 1950s, after losing his savings from the Hollywood years in a series of financial disasters, one of which was ''[[The Story of William Tell]]'' (1954),<ref name="Flynn, Errol 1959"/> he spent his time sailing aimlessly around the Western Mediterranean and its ports aboard his yacht ''Zaca'', becoming a parody of himself with heavy alcohol use leaving him prematurely aged and overweight, and staving off financial ruin by performing in forgettable productions such as ''[[King's Rhapsody (film)|King's Rhapsody]]'' (1955) in the UK's failing movie industry (which he had attempted to return to after Hollywood's door had closed), abortive attempts or commercially unsuccessful self-production in Europe, ''[[Hello God]]'' (1951), ''[[Crossed Swords (1954 film)|Crossed Swords]]'' (1954), occasional roles in also-ran Hollywood movies such as ''[[Mara Maru]]'' (1952), ''[[Istanbul (film)|Istanbul]]'' (1957) and television appearances.<ref>'Errol Flynn', 'Secret Lives Series' (1996), documentary made for Channel 4 Television by Hart-Ryan Productions, England.</ref> As early as 1952 he had been seriously ill with [[hepatitis]] resulting from liver damage.<ref>Flynn, Errol ''My Wicked, Wicked Ways'' (1959) p. 14</ref> In 1956 he presented and sometimes performed in the television [[anthology series]] ''The Errol Flynn Theatre'' that was filmed in England. His acting career received a brief flare of interest once more in response to his appearance in ''[[The Sun Also Rises (1957 film)|The Sun Also Rises]]'' (1957), [[The Big Boodle]] (1957), filmed in Cuba, and in ''[[Too Much, Too Soon]]'' (1958), which had, perhaps, more to do with an audience curious to see evidence of the [[sensationalist]] stories that they had read in the press intermittently through the decade about Flynn's physical deterioration than the quality of these productions themselves. On the back of the publicity about his performance in ''The Sun Also Rises'' he made a fleeting return to Hollywood mainstream film making in ''[[The Roots of Heaven]]'' (1958). Flynn and [[Beverly Aadland]] met with [[Stanley Kubrick]] to discuss appearing together in ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'', but nothing came of it.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Robert Osborne |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0527616820070905 |title=Errol Flynn's daughter remembers notorious dad |agency=Reuters   |date=5 September 2007 |accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> Flynn went to Cuba in late 1958 to film the self-produced [[b-movie]] ''[[Cuban Rebel Girls]]'' and met [[Fidel Castro]], and was initially an enthusiastic supporter of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. He narrated a short film titled ''[[Cuban Story]]: The Truth About Fidel Castro Revolution'' (1959), his last known work as an actor.<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0321867/ |title=The Truth About Fidel Castro Revolution | publisher=IMDB |accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref>

===Writing===
''Beam Ends'' (1937), Flynn's first published book, was an autobiographical account of his sailing experiences as a youth around Australia.

Flynn went to Spain in 1937 as a war correspondent to report for the United States during the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>[http://www.flamingstarfilms.com.au/presskits/Tasmanian_Devil.pdf ''Tasmanian Devil: The Fast and Furious Life of Errol Flynn'' Retrieved 23/05/12]</ref>

In 1946, he published the adventure novel ''[[Showdown (Flynn novel)|Showdown]]''.

Sundry newspaper and magazine articles, including some written for the [[New York Journal American]] by Flynn documenting his time in Cuba with [[Fidel Castro]] and his rebels went unpublished, and were to remain missing until 2009, when they were discovered in the [[University of Texas at Austin]]'s Center for American History.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8298582.stm ''Errol Flynn's Cuban adventures'' Retrieved 23/05/12]</ref>

His final book ''[[My Wicked, Wicked Ways]]'' was written between August and October 1958 with the aid of [[ghostwriter]] [[Earl Conrad]], as Flynn was suffering from depression and alcoholism at that time, and had lost the discipline to write. Published shortly after his death, the book contains scant details of his Hollywood movie career, concentrating instead mainly on the story of his life apart from it, with odd scandalous paragraphs thrown in for shock value, which caused the inevitable media uproar upon publication, but doing no harm at all to its sales figures. In the view of one literary critic the book "remains one of the most compelling and appalling autobiographies written by a Hollywood star, or anyone else for that matter".<ref>Caterson, Simon, "Genius for living driven by lust for death", [[Australian Literary Review]], 3 June 2009. Retrieved 6 June 2009 http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25542210-25132,00.html</ref> As a nod to the expression "[[in like Flynn]]" (popularly believed to reference his ease with women), Flynn wanted to call the book ''In Like Me'', but the publisher refused.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/161252%7C0/Errol-Flynn-8-19.html ''ERROL FLYNN PROFILE'' Retrieved 23/05/12]</ref> In 1985 [[CBS]] produced a television film based on the book.

==Personal life==

===Life-style===
Flynn had a reputation for womanizing, hard drinking, and for a while in the 1940s, [[narcotic]] abuse. His lifestyle caught up with him in public in 1942 when two under-age girls, Betty Hansen and Peggy Satterlee, accused him of [[statutory rape]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6929318/page/2/ |title=Statutory Rape Charges |publisher=MSNBC |date=1 March 2005 |accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> alleging that the event occurred at the [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]] home of Flynn's friend [[Frederick McEvoy]].<ref name="Advertiser1942">[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/48888810?searchTerm=fred%20mcevoy&searchLimits= Flynn's Host Sued For Divorce]. ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]''. 28 October 1942. Retrieved 26 October 2011.</ref> The scandal received immense press attention with many of Flynn's movie fans refusing to accept that the charges were true (one such group that publicly organized to this end was  "The American Boys' Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn (ABCDEF)," which counted in its number [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]),<ref>Valenti, Peter ''Errol Flynn: A Bio-Bibliography''</ref> taking the image that they had of Flynn's screen persona as a reflection of his actual character in real life. The trial took place over January and February 1943, and Flynn was acquitted after a successfully aggressive defense by his lawyer castigated the accusing girls' morals and characters. Although Flynn was acquitted of the charges, the trial's sexually lurid nature played out day by day by the media, created a notorious public reputation of Flynn as a [[seduction|ladies' man]], and permanently damaged his screen image as an idealized romantic lead player, which Warner Bros had expended much time and resources establishing in the eyes of female movie-going audiences.

===Marriages and family===
[[File:Damita & Flynn.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|Flynn and first wife [[Lili Damita]] at Los Angeles airport in 1941.]]
Flynn was married three times: to actress [[Lili Damita]] from 1935 until 1942 (one son, [[Sean Flynn (photojournalist)|Sean Flynn]], 1941-ca.1971); to [[Nora Eddington]] from 1944 until 1949 (two daughters, Deirdre born 1945 and Rory born 1947); and to actress [[Patrice Wymore]] from 1950 until his death (one daughter, Arnella Roma, 1953–98). In Hollywood, he tended to refer to himself as Irish rather than Australian (his father [[Theodore Thomson Flynn]] had been a biologist and a professor at the [[Queen's University of Belfast]] in Northern Ireland during the latter part of his career). After quitting Hollywood Flynn lived with Wymore in [[Port Antonio]], Jamaica in the early 1950s. He was largely responsible for developing tourism to this area, and for a while owned the Titchfield Hotel, which was decorated by the artist [[Olga Lehmann]]. He also popularized trips down rivers on bamboo rafts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0033.html |title=The History of Jamaica – Captivated by Jamaica (Dr. Rebecca Tortello) |publisher=Jamaica-gleaner.com |date=27 August 2002 |accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref>

Flynn was a longtime friend of the painter [[Boris Smirnoff]], who painted his portrait several times, as well as those of Lili Damita, Patrice Wymore and celebrity friends such as [[Edward G. Robinson]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]].<ref>[http://www.the-vineyard.co.uk/art.asp Napier-Ford, Noel: Smirnoff biography for Sir Peter Michael's restaurant "The Vineyard"]</ref>

The gossips took note of his close friendships with [[Lupe Vélez]],<ref>{{harv|Weissmuller, Jr., Reed|2008|pp=73–74}}</ref> [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Dolores del Río]] and [[Carole Lombard]]. Lombard is said to have resisted his advances. She had already met and fallen in love with [[Clark Gable]], but she liked Flynn and invited him to her extravagant soirees.<ref>[http://books.google.com.mx/books?id=SMb1DpW1_YgC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=errol+flynn+dolores+del+rio&source=bl&ots=Ldqe4NrFF8&sig=zqFKpS1Xa-hPTFgrSpWOPerg_wM&hl=es&sa=X&ei=LSJpT6uDGqOJsQKcvvSMCQ&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=errol%20flynn%20dolores%20del%20rio&f=false Thomas McNulty ''Errol Flynn: The Life and Career'']</ref>

In the late 1950s, Flynn met and courted fifteen-year-old [[Beverly Aadland]] at the [[Hollywood Professional School]], and cast her in his final film, ''[[Cuban Rebel Girls]]'' (1959). According to Aadland he planned to marry her and move to a new house in Jamaica, but died before this came to pass.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Flynn, in financial difficulties, flew to [[Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]], on 9 October 1959 to negotiate the lease of his yacht {{USS|Zaca|IX-73|2}} to the businessman George Caldough.  As Caldough was driving Flynn and his travel companion, the actress [[Beverly Aadland]], to the airport on 14 October for a Los Angeles-bound flight, Flynn began complaining of worsening back and leg pains.  He was taken to the Vancouver apartment of Caldough's friend, Dr. Grant Gould, where Flynn had difficulty negotiating the stairs.  After receiving a pain relief injection for what the doctor diagnosed as symptoms of [[degenerative disc disease]] and spinal [[osteoarthritis]], Flynn began regaling those present with extended stories of his life.  He refused a drink when offered it. After receiving a leg massage and manipulation while lying on the floor of the apartment's bedroom, the doctor suggested that he rest there for awhile before attempting to walk again. Flynn responded that he felt "ever so much better".  The doctor retired to an adjacent room to rejoin Aadland, Caldough, and his wife; also present were two friends of the doctor's – Mr. and Mrs. A.D. Cameron – whose social visit had been interrupted by Flynn's impromptu medical stopover. After 20&nbsp;minutes (6:45&nbsp;P.M.) Aadland checked on Flynn and discovered him unresponsive. Despite immediate emergency medical treatment from the doctor and a swift transferral to [[Vancouver General Hospital]] by ambulance, he did not regain consciousness and was pronounced dead there at 7:45&nbsp;P.M.  The cause of death was most likely [[pulmonary embolism]] due to [[deep venous thrombosis]] in one or both of his legs.<ref>Vancouver Coroner's Office report on Errol Flynn's death</ref>

Flynn's body was buried in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]], in [[Glendale, California]].<ref>{{Find a Grave|349}}</ref> Both of his parents survived him.

==Posthumous allegations==
In 1961, Florence Aadland co-authored with Tedd Thomey ''[[The Big Love]]'', a book alleging Flynn was involved in a sexual relationship with her fifteen-year-old daughter Beverly.<ref>{{Cite news |title=A few more literary favorites among the best of the firsts and the best of the lasts |last=Smith |first=Jack |date=30 December 1985 |work=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-30/news/vw-29967_1_first-line |deadurl=no |accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Aadland|first=Florence|first2=Tedd|last2=Thomey|title=The Big Love|publisher=Grand Central Pub.|year=1986|edition=reprint|isbn = 0-446-30159-0}}</ref> It was later made into a play starring [[Tracey Ullman]].<ref name="richards">{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D81E39F937A25757C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=Secret Sharers: Solo Acts in a Confessional Age |last=Richards|first=David|date=14 April 1991|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=15 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DukCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA76&dq=%22florence+aadland%22+%22the+big+love%22#PPA76,M1 | title =Two from the Heart, Two from Hunger|last=Simon|first=John|date=18 March 1991|publisher=[[New York Magazine]]|pages=76–77|accessdate=15 February 2009}}</ref>

===Charles Higham allegations===
In 1980, author [[Charles Higham (biographer)|Charles Higham]] published a controversial biography, ''Errol Flynn: The Untold Story'', in which he alleged that Flynn was a fascist sympathiser who spied for the [[Nazi]]s before and during World War II, and also that he was [[bisexual]].<ref name="higham">{{Cite book|last=Higham|first=Charles|title=Errol Flynn: The Untold Story|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] | year =1980|isbn=0-385-13495-9}}</ref><ref name="Statesman">Charles Higham [http://www.newstatesman.com/200004170041 "The missing Errol Flynn file",] ''New Statesman'', 17 April 2000</ref> Higham admitted to the [[New York Times]] that he had no documents proving Flynn was a Nazi agent.<ref>[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/books/biographer-charles-higham-who-wrote-about-errol-flynn-dies-150183005.html ''Biographer Charles Higham, who wrote about Errol Flynn, dies'' Retrieved 23/05/12]</ref> Flynn's ex-wife Nora Eddington Black denounced the allegations and members of Flynn's family subsequently attempted to sue Higham and his publisher [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] for libel, but since the actor had died in 1959 the suit was dismissed.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/books/charles-higham-celebrity-biographer-dies-at-81.html?_r=1 ''Charles Higham, Celebrity Biographer, Dies at 81'' Retrieved 23/05/12]</ref><ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20077555,00.html ''Fighting for Errol Flynn's Reputation, His Daughters Sue Over Charges He Was a Bi Spy'' Retrieved 23/05/12]</ref>

Other biographers accused Higham of altering FBI documents to sustain his charges against Flynn.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9250507/Charles-Higham.html ''Charles Higham, who has died aged 81, was a much-feared and notoriously bitchy celebrity biographer whose works fell squarely in the "unauthorised" category'' Retrieved 23/05/12]</ref> That Flynn was bisexual was also claimed by [[David Bret]] in ''Errol Flynn: Satan's Angel'' (2000), although Bret denounced the Nazi claims.

Flynn's former housemate [[David Niven]] criticised Higham for his claims in 1980; Higham responded that Niven was ignorant of his friend's activities.<ref>Higham, Charles. "Who's sitting on Errol Flynn's grave?" Sunday Times [London, England] 13 Jan 1980: 15. The Sunday Times Digital Archive. Web. 21 Apr 2014.</ref>

In a 1982 interview with ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' magazine, [[Ronald DeWolf]], previously known as L. Ron Hubbard, Jr., claimed that his [[L. Ron Hubbard|father]] had a strong friendship with Flynn, who was considered a family friend to the point of being looked upon as an adoptive father to DeWolf. He claimed Flynn and his father were alike, and engaged in various illegal activities together, including indulging in sexual acts with under-age girls and also drug smuggling. Flynn, however, never became a practitioner of Hubbard's religious group, [[Scientology]].<ref>{{cite journal

 | title = Inside The Church of Scientology: An Exclusive Interview with L. Ron Hubbard, Jr.

In 2000, Higham wrote an article that also claimed that Flynn was previously accused of sympathising with [[Adolf Hitler]] based on his association with Dr. [[Hermann Erben]], an Austrian who served in German military intelligence. Unreleased MI5 files held by the [[British Home Office]] were claimed in 2000 to demonstrate Flynn worked for the Allies during the war.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1379907/Errol-Flynn-spied-for-Allies-not-the-Nazis.html|title=Errol Flynn 'spied for Allies, not the Nazis'|last=Bamber|first=David|date=19 June 2001|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref> Flynn offered to spy on Ireland for America during the war but was turned down because of FDR's fear that he sympathised with the Nazis.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-17836344|title=Make me a spy in Ireland says Errol Flynn|last=McCann|first=Naula|date=25 April 2012|work=BBC|location=UK|accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref>

Subsequent biographies – notably Tony Thomas' ''Errol Flynn: The Spy Who Never Was'' (Citadel, 1990) and Buster Wiles' ''[[My Days With Errol Flynn]]: The Autobiography of a Stuntman'' (Roundtable, 1988) – have rejected Higham's claims as pure fabrication. Flynn's political leanings, say these biographies, appear to have been leftist: he was a supporter of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and of the [[Cuban Revolution]], even narrating a documentary titled ''Cuban Story'' shortly before his death. Flynn also wrote, financed and starred in the film ''[[Cuban Rebel Girls]]'' in which his character helps Castro's revolution. Flynn defended his visit to [[Cuba]] in an appearance on a [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC)]] television show [[Front Page Challenge]] early in 1959. According to his autobiography, he considered [[Fidel Castro]] a close personal friend and drinking partner.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known for his work in [[swashbuckler]] roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy.
