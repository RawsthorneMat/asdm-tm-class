'''Paul Thomas Anderson''' (born June 26, 1970) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. Interested in film-making at a young age, Anderson was encouraged by his father [[Ernie Anderson]] (a [[disc jockey]], and [[television]] and [[radio]] [[voice acting|announcer/voiceover artist]]) to become a filmmaker. Anderson is a distinctive filmmaker of his generation, initially being praised as a [[wunderkind]] after the release of the dramas ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]''.

In 1993, he wrote and directed a short film titled ''[[Cigarettes & Coffee]]'' on a budget of $20,000.
After he attended the [[Sundance Institute]], Anderson had a deal with [[Rysher Entertainment]] to direct his first feature film, a neo-noir crime thriller entitled ''[[Hard Eight (film)|Hard Eight]]'', in 1996. Anderson received critical and commercial success for his film ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997), set during the [[Golden Age of Porn]] in the 1970s and 1980s. His third feature, ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999), received wide acclaim despite struggling at the box office.

In 2002, the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'', Anderson's fourth feature, was released to positive reviews. After a five-year absence, the epic drama ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'' was released to critical acclaim in 2007. It is Anderson's highest-grossing film to date and is considered by some critics to be one of the most important films of the 21st century. In 2012, Anderson's sixth film, the drama ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'', was released to critical acclaim. His seventh film, the crime comedy-drama ''[[Inherent Vice (film)|Inherent Vice]]'', based on the [[Inherent Vice|novel of the same name]] by [[Thomas Pynchon]], was released in 2014, to general acclaim. Anderson has been nominated for six [[Academy Awards]] over the course of his career.
