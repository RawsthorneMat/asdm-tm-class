'''Henry Jaynes 'Hank' Fonda''' (May 16, 1905 – August 12, 1982) was an American film and [[Stage (theater)|stage]] actor<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', August 18, 1982.</ref> with a career spanning more than five decades.

Fonda made his mark early as a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor. He also appeared in 1938 in plays performed in [[White Plains, New York]], with [[Joan Tompkins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0867000/bio|title=Tim Dunleavy, Biography for Joan Tompkins|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}</ref> He made his [[Hollywood]] debut in 1935, and his career gained momentum after his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated performance as [[Tom Joad]] in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'', a 1940 [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel about an [[Oklahoma]] family who moved west during the [[Dust Bowl]]. Throughout six decades in Hollywood, Fonda cultivated a strong, appealing screen image in such classics as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'', ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'' and ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]''. Later, Fonda moved both toward darker epics as [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' and lighter roles in family comedies like ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine and Ours]]'' with [[Lucille Ball]], winning the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] at the [[54th Academy Awards]] for the movie ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'', his final film role.

Fonda was the patriarch of a family of famous actors, including daughter [[Jane Fonda]], son [[Peter Fonda]], granddaughter [[Bridget Fonda]], and grandson [[Troy Garity]]. His family and close friends called him "Hank". In 1999, he was named the sixth-[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|Greatest Male Star of All Time]] by the [[American Film Institute]].

==Family history and early life==
The Fonda surname originated with immigrants from [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], to the [[Netherlands]], in the 15th century. In 1642, a branch of the Fonda family immigrated to the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]], on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] of [[North America]].<ref name="FONDADOTORG">[http://www.fonda.org/ Fonda family history and genealogy website]</ref> They were among the first Dutch population to settle in what is now upstate New York, establishing the town of [[Fonda, New York|Fonda]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. By 1888, many of their descendants had relocated to [[Nebraska]].<ref>Bosworth, Patricia, [http://books.google.com/books?id=xpl3_q-x8gUC&printsec=frontcover ''Jane Fonda, The Private Life of a Public Woman''], Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011, [http://books.google.com/books?id=xpl3_q-x8gUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=1642&f=false p.18].</ref>

Fonda was brought up as a [[Christian Scientist]], though he was baptized an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} in Grand Island.  He said, "[M]y whole damn family was nice."

He worked part-time in his father's print plant and imagined a possible career as a journalist. Later, he worked after school for the phone company. He also enjoyed drawing.

Retrieved on January 11, 2007.</ref> but he did not graduate. He took a job with the [[Equifax|Retail Credit Company.]]

==Career==

===Early stage work===
At age 20, Fonda started his acting career at the [[Omaha Community Playhouse]], when his mother's friend [[Dodie Brando]] (mother of [[Marlon Brando]]) recommended that he try out for a juvenile part in ''You and I'', in which he was cast as Ricky.<ref name=iron/> He was fascinated by the stage, learning everything from set construction to stage production, and embarrassed by his acting ability.<ref>Fonda 1981, p.30.</ref> When he received the lead in ''Merton of the Movies'', he realized the beauty of acting as a profession, as it allowed him to deflect attention from his own tongue-tied personality and create stage characters relying on someone else's scripted words. Fonda decided to quit his job and go East in 1928 to strike his fortune.

He arrived on Cape Cod and played a role at the Cape Playhouse in [[Dennis, Massachusetts]]; a friend took him over to Falmouth, where he quickly became a valued member of the new [[University Players]], an intercollegiate [[summer stock]] company.  There he worked with [[Margaret Sullavan]], his future wife.<ref>Houghton 1951: pp. 56-58.</ref> [[James Stewart]] joined the Players months after Fonda left, and they later became lifelong friends.<ref>Fonda and Stewart were not members of the University Players at the same time. Fonda left the Players at the end of their 1931-32 winter season in Baltimore and joined his new wife, Margaret Sullavan, in New York. Stewart did not join the University Players until the summer of 1932, after his graduation from Princeton. See Houghton 1951, ''supra''.</ref> He landed his first professional role in the University Players production of ''The Jest'', by [[Sem Benelli]].  [[Joshua Logan]], a young sophomore at Princeton who had been double-cast in the show, gave Fonda the part of Tornaquinci, "an elderly Italian with long, white beard and heavy wig." Also in the cast of ''The Jest'' with Fonda and Logan were [[Bretaigne Windust]], [[Kent Smith]], and [[Eleanor Phelps]].<ref>Houghton 1951: p. 58.</ref>

The tall (6'1.5") and slim (160&nbsp;lbs) Fonda headed for [[New York City]], where he was soon joined by Stewart (after Fonda's short marriage to [[Margaret Sullavan]] ended.)  The two men were roommates and honed their skills on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]]. Fonda appeared in theatrical productions from 1926 to 1934. They fared no better than many Americans in and out of work during the [[Great Depression]], sometimes lacking enough money to take the subway.<ref>Fonda 1981, p.60.</ref>

===Entering Hollywood===
[[File:Henry Fonda in Jezebel trailer.jpg|thumb|175px|Fonda in ''Jezebel'']]
Fonda got the first break, as he was hired to make his first film appearance in 1935 as [[Janet Gaynor]]'s [[leading man]] in [[20th Century Fox]]'s screen adaptation of ''[[The Farmer Takes a Wife]]''; he reprised his role from the Broadway production of the same name, which had gained him critical recognition. Suddenly, Fonda was making $3,000 a week and dining with Hollywood stars such as [[Carole Lombard]].<ref>Fonda 1981, p. 95.</ref> Stewart soon followed him to Hollywood, and they roomed together again, in lodgings next door to [[Greta Garbo]]. In 1935 Fonda starred in the RKO film ''I Dream Too Much'' with the opera star [[Lily Pons]]. ''The New York Times'' announced him as "Henry Fonda, the most likable of the new crop of romantic juveniles."<ref>Fonda 1981, p.102.</ref>
Fonda's film career blossomed as he costarred with [[Sylvia Sidney]] and [[Fred MacMurray]] in ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936 film)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' (1936), the first [[Technicolor]] movie filmed outdoors.

He starred with ex-wife Margaret Sullavan in ''[[The Moon's Our Home]]'', and a short re-kindling of their relationship led to a brief but temporary consideration of remarriage.  Fonda got the nod for the lead role in ''[[You Only Live Once (film)|You Only Live Once]]'' (1937), also costarring Sidney, and directed by [[Fritz Lang]]. He was a critical success opposite [[Bette Davis]], who had picked him, in the film ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]'' (1938).  This was followed by the title role in ''[[Young Mr. Lincoln]]'' (1939), his first collaboration with director [[John Ford]], and that year he played [[Frank James]] in [[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]] (1939). Another 1939 film was ''[[Drums Along the Mohawk]]'', also directed by Ford.

[[File:Henry Fonda in The Lady Eve trailer.JPG|thumb|Fonda in ''The Lady Eve'']]
Fonda's successes led Ford to recruit him to play "Tom Joad" in the film version of [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940).  A reluctant [[Darryl Zanuck]], who preferred [[Tyrone Power]], insisted on Fonda's signing a seven-year contract with his studio [[Twentieth Century-Fox]].<ref>Rabin, Kenn. [http://www.filmnight.org/grapes.htm ''The Grapes of Wrath''.] FilmNight.org. Retrieved on January 11, 2007.</ref> Fonda agreed, and was ultimately nominated for an Academy Award for his work in the 1940 film, which many consider to be his finest role. Fonda starred in ''[[The Return of Frank James]]'' (1940) with [[Gene Tierney]]. He then played opposite [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in [[Preston Sturges]]' ''[[The Lady Eve]]'' (1941), and again teamed with Tierney in the successful [[screwball comedy]] ''[[Rings on Her Fingers]]'' (1942).  She was one of Fonda's favorite co-stars, and they appeared in three films together. He was acclaimed for his role in ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943).

Mark. [http://www.fonda.org/military.htm#WW20 Fonda Military.] Fonda.org, October 23, 2006. Retrieved on January 11, 2007.</ref>

===Post-war career===
After the war, Fonda took a break from movies and attended Hollywood parties and enjoyed civilian life. He and Stewart would listen to records and invite [[Johnny Mercer]], [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Dinah Shore]], and [[Nat King Cole]] over for music, with the latter giving the family piano lessons.<ref>Fonda 1981, p.165.</ref> Fonda played [[Wyatt Earp]] in ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), which was directed by [[John Ford]]. Fonda did seven post-war films until his contract with Fox expired, the last being [[Otto Preminger]]'s ''[[Daisy Kenyon]]'' (1947), opposite [[Joan Crawford]]. He starred in ''[[The Fugitive (1947 film)|The Fugitive]]'' (1947), which was the first film of John Ford's new production company, [[Argosy Pictures]]. In 1948 he appeared in a subsequent Argosy/Ford production, ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'', as a rigid Army colonel, along with [[John Wayne]] and [[Shirley Temple]] in her first adult role.

[[File:Henry Fonda - USN.jpg|right|thumb|125px|Fonda in Navy uniform]]
Refusing another long-term studio contract, Fonda returned to Broadway, wearing his own officer's cap to originate the title role in ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'', a comedy about the Navy, where Fonda, a junior officer, wages a private war against the captain. He won a 1948 [[Tony Award]] for the part. Fonda followed that by reprising his performance in the national tour and with successful stage runs in ''Point of No Return'' and ''The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial''. After an eight-year absence from films, he starred in the 1955 film version of ''Mister Roberts'' with [[James Cagney]], [[William Powell]] and [[Jack Lemmon]], continuing a pattern of bringing his acclaimed stage roles to life on the big screen. On the set of ''Mister Roberts'', Fonda came to blows with [[John Ford]], who punched him during filming, and Fonda vowed never to work for the director again. While he kept that vow for years, Fonda spoke glowingly of Ford in [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s documentary ''[[Directed by John Ford]]'' and in a documentary on Ford's career alongside Ford and James Stewart.  Fonda refused to participate until he learned that Ford had insisted on casting Fonda as the lead in the film version of ''Mr. Roberts,'' reviving Fonda's film career after concentrating on the stage for years.

After ''Mr. Roberts'', Fonda next acted in [[Paramount Pictures]]'s production of the [[Leo Tolstoy]] epic ''[[War and Peace (1956 film)|War and Peace]]'' (1956), in which he played Pierre Bezukhov opposite [[Audrey Hepburn]]; it took two years to shoot. Fonda worked with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] in 1956, playing a man falsely accused of robbery in ''[[The Wrong Man]]''; the unusual semi-documentary work of Hitchcock's was based on an actual incident and partly filmed on location.
[[File:Bacall,Bogart,Fonda crop.jpg|left|thumb|[[Lauren Bacall]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], and Fonda in a live 1955 TV version of ''[[The Petrified Forest]]'']]
In 1957, Fonda made his first foray into production with ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', based on a teleplay and a script by [[Reginald Rose]] and directed by [[Sidney Lumet]]. The low-budget movie was completed in seventeen days of filming, mostly in one claustrophobic jury room had a strong cast, including [[Jack Klugman]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Martin Balsam]], and [[E. G. Marshall]]. The intense film about twelve jurors deciding the fate of a young Puerto Rican man accused of murder was well received by critics worldwide. Fonda shared the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and [[Golden Globe]] nominations with co-producer Reginald Rose and won the 1958 [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor]] for his performance as "Juror #8", who with logic and persistence eventually sways all the jurors to an acquittal. Early on the film drew poorly, but after winning critical acclaim and awards, it proved a success. In spite of the good outcome, Fonda vowed that he would never produce a movie again, fearing that failing as a producer might derail his acting career.<ref>Fonda 1981, p.250.</ref> After acting in the [[western movies]] ''[[The Tin Star]]'' (1957) and ''[[Warlock (1959 film)|Warlock]]'' (1959), Fonda returned to the production seat for the [[NBC]] western television series ''[[The Deputy (TV series)|The Deputy]]'' (1959–1961), in which he  starred as Marshal Simon Fry. His co-stars were [[Allen Case]] and [[Read Morgan]].

[[File:Westwon trailer Fonda.png|thumb|300px|Fonda in ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'']]
During the 1960s, Fonda performed in a number of war and western epics, including 1962's ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' and the Cinerama production ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'', 1965's ''[[In Harm's Way]]'' and ''[[Battle of the Bulge (film)|Battle of the Bulge]]''. In the [[Cold War]] suspense film ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail-Safe]]'' (1964), Fonda played the President of the United States who tries to avert a nuclear holocaust through tense negotiations with the Soviets after American bombers are mistakenly ordered to attack the USSR. He also returned to more light-hearted cinema in ''[[Spencer's Mountain]]'' (1963), which was the inspiration for the TV series, ''[[The Waltons]]''.

Fonda appeared against type as the villain 'Frank' in 1968's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]''. After initially turning down the role, he was convinced to accept it by actor [[Eli Wallach]] and director [[Sergio Leone]], who flew from Italy to the United States to persuade him to take the part. Fonda had planned on wearing a pair of brown-colored [[contact lenses]], but Leone preferred the paradox of contrasting close-up shots of Fonda's innocent-looking blue eyes with the vicious personality of the character Fonda played.

Fonda's relationship with Jimmy Stewart survived their disagreements over politics — Fonda was a [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], and Stewart a [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. After a heated argument, they avoided talking politics with each other. The two men teamed up for 1968's ''[[Firecreek]]'', where Fonda again played the heavy. In 1970, Fonda and Stewart costarred in the [[Western film|western]] ''[[The Cheyenne Social Club]]'', a minor film in which they humorously argued politics. They had first appeared together on film in ''[[On Our Merry Way]]'' (1948), a comedy which also starred [[William Demarest]] and [[Fred MacMurray]] and featured a grown-up [[Carl Switzer|Carl "Alfalfa" Switzer]], who had acted as a child in ''Our Gang''.<ref>[http://www.4alfalfa.com/Alfalfaddendum/merry.html On Our Merry Way.]  4alfalfa.com.  Retrieved on January 11, 2007.</ref>

===Late career===
Despite approaching his seventies, Fonda continued to work in theater, television and film through the 1970s. In 1970, Fonda appeared in three films, the most successful ''[[The Cheyenne Social Club]]''. The other two films were ''[[Too Late the Hero (film)|Too Late the Hero]]'', in which Fonda played a secondary role, and ''[[There Was a Crooked Man...|There Was a Crooked Man]]'', about Paris Pitman Jr. (played by [[Kirk Douglas]]) trying to escape from an Arizona prison.

Fonda returned to both foreign and television productions, which provided career sustenance through a decade in which many aging screen actors suffered waning careers. He starred in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[The Smith Family (TV series)|The Smith Family]]'' between 1971 and 1972.  A [[TV-movie]] adaptation of [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel, 1973's ''The Red Pony'', earned Fonda an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] nomination. After the unsuccessful [[Hollywood]] melodrama, ''Ash Wednesday'', he filmed three [[Italy|Italian]] productions released in 1973 and 1974. The most successful of these, ''[[My Name is Nobody]]'', presented Fonda in a rare comedic performance as an old gunslinger whose plans to retire are dampened by a "fan" of sorts.

Fonda continued stage acting throughout his last years, including several demanding roles in [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays. He returned to Broadway in 1974 for the biographical drama, ''[[Clarence Darrow]]'', for which he was nominated for a Tony Award. Fonda's health had been deteriorating for years, but his first outward symptoms occurred after a performance of the play in April 1974, when he collapsed from exhaustion. After the appearance of a [[Cardiac arrhythmia|heart arrhythmia]] brought on by [[prostate cancer]], he had a pacemaker installed following cancer surgery.  Fonda returned to the play in 1975. After the run of a 1978 play, ''First Monday of October'', he took the advice of his doctors and quit plays, though he continued to star in films and television.

Fonda appeared in a revival of ''[[The Time of Your Life]]'' that opened in March 17, 1972 at the [[Lux Radio Theater|Huntington Hartford Theater]] in Los Angeles where Fonda, [[Richard Dreyfuss]], [[Gloria Grahame]], [[Ron Thompson (actor)|Ron Thompson]],<ref name="PM">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/column/160872-american-pop-matters-ron-thompson-the-illustrated-man-unsung/|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2012-08-02|title='American Pop'...

In 1976, Fonda appeared in several notable television productions, the first being ''Collision Course'', the story of the volatile relationship between President Harry Truman ([[E. G. Marshall]]) and General MacArthur (Fonda), produced by ABC. After an appearance in the acclaimed [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] broadcast of ''Almos' a Man'', based on a story by [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], he starred in the epic [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] miniseries ''Captains and Kings'', based on [[Taylor Caldwell]]'s novel. Three years later, he appeared in ABC's ''[[Roots: The Next Generations]]'', but the miniseries was overshadowed by its predecessor, ''[[Roots (TV miniseries)|Roots]]''. Also in 1976, Fonda starred in the [[World War II]] blockbuster ''[[Midway (film)|Midway]]''.

Fonda finished the 1970s in a number of [[disaster film]]s. The first of these was the 1977 Italian killer [[octopus]] thriller ''Tentacoli'' (''[[Tentacles (film)|Tentacles]]'') and
''[[Rollercoaster (1977 film)|Rollercoaster]]'', in which Fonda appeared with [[Richard Widmark]] and a young [[Helen Hunt]]. He performed  again with Widmark, [[Olivia de Havilland]], [[Fred MacMurray]], and [[José Ferrer]] in the [[Africanized bee|killer bee]] action film ''[[The Swarm (film)|The Swarm]]''. He also acted in the global disaster film ''[[Meteor (film)|Meteor]]'' (his second role as a sitting President of the United States after ''Fail-Safe''), with [[Sean Connery]], [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Karl Malden]], and the [[Canada|Canadian]] production ''[[City on Fire (1979 film)|City on Fire]]'', which also featured [[Shelley Winters]] and [[Ava Gardner]]. Fonda had a small role with his son, Peter, in ''[[Wanda Nevada]]'' (1979), with [[Brooke Shields]].

As Fonda's health declined and he took longer breaks between filming, critics began to take notice of his extensive body of work. In 1979, he was inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]] for his achievements on Broadway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10F14FB3F5410728DDDA00994D9415B898BF1D3|title=Theater Hall of Fame Enshrines 51 Artists|publisher=New York Times}}</ref> Lifetime Achievement awards from the [[Golden Globes]] and [[Academy Awards]] followed in 1980 and 1981, respectively.

Fonda continued to act into the early 1980s, though all but one of the productions he was featured in before his death were for television. The television works included the critically acclaimed live performance of [[Preston Jones (playwright)|Preston Jones]]' ''[[The Oldest Living Graduate (play)|The Oldest Living Graduate]]'' and the [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] nominated ''[[Gideon's Trumpet]]'' (co-starring [[Fay Wray]] in her last performance) about [[Clarence Gideon]]'s fight to have the right to publicly funded legal counsel for the indigent.

Directed by [[Mark Rydell]], the project provided unprecedented collaborations between Fonda and [[Katharine Hepburn]], along with Fonda and his daughter, [[Jane Fonda|Jane]].  The elder Fonda played an emotionally brittle and distant father who becomes more accessible at the end of his life.  Jane Fonda has said that elements of the story mimicked their real-life relationship, and helped them resolve certain issues. She bought the film rights in the hope that her father would play the role, and later described it as "a gift to my father that was so unbelievably successful."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07EFD71738F935A35756C0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | first=Dana | last=Kennedy | accessdate=May 4, 2010 | title=An Unscripted Life Starring Herself | date=May 6, 2001}}</ref>

Premiered in December 1981, the film was well received by critics, and after a [[Roadshow theatrical release|limited release]] on December 4 ''On Golden Pond'' developed enough of an audience to be widely released on January 22. With 10 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, the film earned nearly $120 million at the box office, becoming an unexpected blockbuster. In addition to wins for Hepburn (Best Actress), and Thompson (Screenplay), ''On Golden Pond'' brought Fonda his only Oscar - for Best Actor (he was the oldest recipient of the award; it also earned him a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] Best Actor award).  Fonda was by that point too ill to attend the ceremony, and his daughter Jane accepted on his behalf. She said when accepting the award that her dad would probably quip, "Well, ain't I lucky." After Fonda's death, some film critics called this performance "his last and greatest role".{{Who|date=November 2010}}

Fonda's final performance was in the 1981 television drama ''Summer Solstice''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/47630/Summer-Solstice/overview|title=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2012-01-24}}</ref> with Myrna Loy.  It was filmed after ''On Golden Pond'' had wrapped and Fonda was in rapidly declining health.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===
Fonda was married five times and had three children, one of them adopted. His marriage to [[Margaret Sullavan]] in 1931 soon ended in separation, which was finalized in a 1933 divorce.

In 1936, he married [[Frances Ford Seymour|Frances Ford Seymour Brokaw]], widow of a wealthy industrialist, George Tuttle Brokaw.<ref>Bosworth (2011), ''Jane Fonda'', p. 22</ref> The Brokaws had a daughter, Frances de Villers, nicknamed "Pan," who had been born soon after the Brokaws marriage in 1931.<ref>Bosworth, ''Jane Fonda'', p. 222</ref>

Fonda met his future wife Frances at [[Denham Studios]] in England on the set of ''[[Wings of the Morning (film)|Wings of the Morning]]'',<ref>Christopher Andersen (1990) ''Citizen Jane''</ref> the first British picture to be filmed in technicolor. They had two children, [[Jane Fonda|Jane]] (born December 21, 1937) and [[Peter Fonda|Peter]] (born February 23, 1940), both of whom became successful actors.  They have each had Oscar nominations.
[[File:Henry Fonda and Jane - 1943.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jane Fonda]] with her father in 1943]]
In August 1949, Fonda announced to Frances that he wanted a divorce so he could remarry; their thirteen years of marriage had not been happy ones for him.<ref>Bosworth (2011), ''Jane Fonda'',  p. 65</ref> Devastated by Fonda's confession, and plagued by emotional problems for many years, Frances went into the [[Austen Riggs Center|Austen Riggs Psychiatric Hospital]] in January 1950 for treatment. She committed suicide there on April 14. Before her death she had written six notes to various individuals, but left no final message for her husband. Fonda quickly arranged a private funeral with only himself and his mother-in-law, Sophie Seymour, in attendance.<ref>Bosworth (2011), ''Jane Fonda'', p. 69</ref> Years later Dr. Margaret Gibson, the psychiatrist who had treated Frances at Austen Riggs, described Henry Fonda: "He was a cold, self-absorbed person, a complete [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissist]]." <ref>Bosworth (2011), ''Jane Fonda'', p. 67</ref>

Later in 1950, Fonda married [[Susan Blanchard (socialite)|Susan Blanchard]], with whom he had been having an affair since sometime in 1948.  She was twenty-one years old, the daughter of Australian-born interior designer [[Dorothy Hammerstein]], and the step-daughter of [[Oscar Hammerstein II]].<ref>Bosworth (2011), ''Jane Fonda'', pp. 63-64</ref> Together, they adopted a daughter, Ari Fishman (born 1953).<ref>{{Wayback |date=20051124051938 |url=http://fonda.org/gedtree/1028.html |title=Ari Fonda 1953 - }}  fonda.org, January 16, 2005.  Retrieved on January 11, 2007.</ref> They divorced three years later. Blanchard was in awe of Fonda, and she described her role in the marriage as "a geisha," doing everything she could to please him, dealing with and solving problems he would not acknowledge.<ref>Bosworth, Patricia, "Jane Fonda, The Private Life of a Public Woman," Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011, p. 78</ref>

In 1957, Fonda married the Italian [[baroness]] [[Afdera Franchetti]];<ref>[http://www.grazianoarici.it/oldies/pages/GA016526.htm Graziano Arici Archives / GA016526: Celebrities from '40's to '70's.]  Graziano Arici Photographer. Retrieved on January 11, 2007.</ref> they divorced in 1961. Soon after, in 1965, Fonda married Shirlee Mae Adams, and remained with her until his death in 1982.

Fonda's relationship with his children has been described as "emotionally distant." Fonda loathed displays of feeling in himself or others, and this was a consistent part of his character. Whenever he felt that his emotional wall was being breached, he had outbursts of anger, exhibiting a furious temper that terrified his family.<ref>Bosworth (2011), ''Jane Fonda'', p. 78</ref> In Peter Fonda's 1998 autobiography ''Don't Tell Dad'' (1998), he described how he was never sure how his father felt about him.  He never volunteered to his father that he loved him until he was elderly, and Peter finally heard, "I love you, son."<ref>Araujo, Djalma. [http://www.fumcsd.org/sermons/sr092798.html Sermon of September 27, 1998.] First United Methodist Church of San Diego.  Retrieved on January 11, 2007.</ref> His daughter Jane rejected her father's friendships with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] actors such as [[John Wayne]] and James Stewart.  Their relationship became extremely strained as Jane Fonda became a left-wing activist.

Jane Fonda reported feeling detached from her father, especially during her early acting days. In 1958 she met [[Lee Strasberg]] while visiting her father at Malibu. The Fonda and Strasberg families were neighbors, and she had developed a friendship with Strasberg's daughter, [[Susan Strasberg|Susan]]. Jane Fonda began studying acting with Strasberg, learning the techniques of "[[method acting|The Method]]" of which Strasberg was a renowned proponent. This proved to be a pivotal point in her career.  As Jane Fonda developed her skill as an actress, she became frustrated with her father's talent that, to her, appeared a demonstration of effortless ability.<ref>Bosworth (2011), ''Jane Fonda'', pp. 107-108</ref>

===Politics===
Fonda was an ardent supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and "an admirer" of U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].<ref name=JFK>[http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1960/henry-fonda 1960 Kennedy campaign ad]</ref> In [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]], Fonda appeared in a campaign commercial for presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]]. The ad focused on Kennedy's [[United States Navy|naval]] service during [[World War II]], specifically the famous [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]] incident.<ref name=JFK/>

===On acting===
In the late 1950s, when Jane Fonda asked her father how he prepared before going on stage, she was baffled by his answer, "I don't know, I stand there, I think about my wife, Afdera, I don't know."

The writer Al Aronowitz, while working on a profile of Jane Fonda for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in the 1960s, asked Henry Fonda about Method acting: "I can't articulate about the Method", he told me, "because I never studied it. I don't mean to suggest that I have any feelings one way or the other about it...I don't know what the Method is and I don't care what the Method is. Everybody's got a method. Everybody can't articulate about their method, and I can't, if I have a method—and Jane sometimes says that I use the Method, that is, the capital letter Method, without being aware of it. Maybe I do; it doesn't matter."{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Aronowitz reported Jane saying, "My father can't articulate the way he works. He just can't do it. He's not even conscious of what he does, and it made him nervous for me to try to articulate what I was trying to do. And I sensed that immediately, so we did very little talking about it...he said, 'Shut up, I don't want to hear about it.' He didn't want me to tell him about it, you know. He wanted to make fun of it."{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Henry Fonda in Slim.JPG|thumb|right|Fonda as ''[[Slim (film)|Slim]]'' (1937)]]
Fonda died at his [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] home on August 12, 1982, from [[heart disease]]. Fonda's wife, Shirlee, his daughter Jane and his son Peter were at his side when he died.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=13&prgDate=16-Aug-07 Interview with Peter Fonda, NPR's "Fresh Air].</ref> He suffered from [[prostate cancer]], but this did not directly cause his death and was noted only as a concurrent ailment on his death certificate.

Fonda requested that no funeral be held, and he was promptly cremated. President [[Ronald Reagan]], a former actor himself, hailed Fonda as "a true professional dedicated to excellence in his craft. He graced the screen with a sincerity and accuracy which made him a legend."<ref>"Fonda is cremated, no funeral", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', August 13, 1982, p. 1</ref>

Fonda is widely recognized as one of the Hollywood greats of the classic era. On the [[centenary]] of his birth, May 16, 2005, [[Turner Classic Movies]] honored him with a marathon of his films. Also in May 2005, the [[United States Post Office]] released a 37-cent [[postage stamp]] with an artist's drawing of Fonda as part of their "Hollywood legends" series.<ref name="usps"/>  [[The Fonda Theatre]] in Hollywood, California, originally known as the Carter DeHaven Music Box, was named for the actor in 1985 by the [[Nederlander Organization]].
