'''Robert Bernard Altman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|l|t|m|ən}}; February 20, 1925 – November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. A five-time nominee of the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and an enduring figure from the [[New Hollywood]] era, Altman was considered a "maverick" in making [[Cinema of the United States|films]] that are highly [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]], but with a stylized perspective unlike most Hollywood films. He is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in history.

His style of filmmaking was unique among directors in that his subjects covered most genres but with a "[[subversion|subversive]]" twist, typically relying on satire and humor to express his personal vision. Altman developed a reputation for being "anti-Hollywood" and non-conformist in both his themes and directing style. However, actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise, thereby inspiring their own creativity.

He preferred large casts for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic [[Pauline Kael]], writing about his directing style, said that Altman could "make film fireworks out of next to nothing."<ref name=Wakeman/>

In 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] recognized Altman's body of work with an [[Academy Honorary Award]]. He never won a competitive Oscar despite five nominations. His films ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) have been selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. Altman is one of the few filmmakers whose films have won the [[Golden Bear]] at [[Berlin Film Festival|Berlin]], the [[Golden Lion]] at [[Venice Film Festival|Venice]], and the [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]].

==Early life and career==
Altman was born on February 20, 1925 in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the son of Helen (née Matthews), a ''[[Mayflower]]'' descendant from [[Nebraska]], and Bernard Clement Altman, a wealthy insurance salesman and amateur gambler, who came from an upper-class family. Altman's ancestry was German, English and Irish;<ref name="altman3">{{Cite news |last=Lemons |first=Stephen |title=Robert Altman |page=2 |publisher=Salon.com |url =http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2000/08/15/altman/index.html |accessdate=November 22, 2006 }}</ref><ref name="altman1">{{Cite news |last=The Daily Telegraph |title=Robert Altman, 81, Mercurial Director of Masterworks and Flops |publisher=The New York Sun |date=November 22, 2006 |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/44018 |accessdate=November 22, 2006 }}</ref> his paternal grandfather, Frank Altman, Sr., anglicized the spelling of the family name from "Altmann" to "Altman".<ref name="altman1"/> Altman had a Catholic upbringing,<ref name="altman2">{{cite web |title=The Religious Affiliation of Robert Altman |publisher=Adherents.com |date=July 28, 2005 |url =http://www.adherents.com/people/pa/Robert_Altman.html |accessdate=November 22, 2006 }}</ref> but he did not continue to practice as a Catholic as an adult,<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/may/01/features.weekend "Interview: Robert Altman"], ''The Guardian''</ref> although he has been referred to as "a sort of Catholic" and a Catholic director.<ref name="altman2"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholichistory.net/Spotlights/SpotlightMovies.htm |title=Spotlight: Catholics at the Movies |publisher=Catholichistory.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref> He was educated at [[Jesuit]] schools, including [[Rockhurst High School]], in Kansas City.<ref>{{cite news |author=Butler, Robert W. |date=March 5, 2006 |title=Finally, An Attitude Adjustment: Hollywood's Establishment Now Embraces Rebel Director Altman  |newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star]] |page=5 |accessdate=November 25, 2011 }}</ref> He graduated from [[Wentworth Military Academy]] in [[Lexington, Missouri]] in 1943.

In 1943 Altman joined the [[United States Army Air Forces]] at the age of 18.  During World War II, Altman flew more than 50 bombing missions as a crewman on a [[B-24 Liberator]] with the 307th Bomb Group in [[Borneo]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name="altm">{{cite web |year=2011 |url=http://www.b24bestweb.com/b24bestweb-Famous.htm|title = Famous B-24/PB4Y Crew Members |publisher=B-24 Best Web |accessdate=July 25, 2011 }}</ref>

Upon his discharge in 1946, Altman moved to California. He worked in publicity for a company that had invented a [[tattoo]]ing machine to identify dogs. He entered filmmaking on a whim, selling a script to [[RKO]] for the 1948 picture ''[[Bodyguard (1948 film)|Bodyguard]]'', which he co-wrote with George W. George. Altman's immediate success encouraged him to move to New York City, where he attempted to forge a career as a writer.  Having enjoyed little success, in 1949 he returned to Kansas City, where he accepted a job as a director and writer of industrial films for the [[Calvin Company]]. In February 2012, an early Calvin film directed by Altman, ''Modern Football'' (1951), was found by filmmaker Gary Huggins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2012/03/fan-uncovers-robert-altmans-first-film/1 |title=Fan uncovers Robert Altman's first film |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2012-03-14 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2012/03/13/robert-altmans-lost-classic-modern-football/ |title=Robert Altman's Lost Classic: 'Modern Football' |publisher=Forbes |date=2012-03-13 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref>

Altman directed some 65 industrial films and documentaries before being hired by a local businessman in 1956 to write and direct a feature film in Kansas City on [[juvenile delinquency]]. The film, titled ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', made for $60,000, was purchased by [[United Artists]] for $150,000, and released in 1957. While primitive, this teen [[exploitation film]] contained the foundations of Altman's later work in its use of casual, naturalistic dialogue. With its success, Altman moved from Kansas City to California for the last time. He co-directed ''[[The James Dean Story]]'' (1957), a documentary rushed into theaters to capitalize on the actor's recent death and marketed to his emerging cult following.

==Television work==
Altman's first forays into TV directing were on the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] drama series ''[[Pulse of the City]]'' (1953–1954), and an episode of the 1956 western series ''[[The Sheriff of Cochise]]''. After [[Alfred Hitchcock]] saw Altman's early features ''The Delinquents'' and ''The James Dean Story'', he hired him as a director for his [[CBS]] anthology series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''. After just two episodes, Altman resigned due to differences with a producer, but this exposure enabled him to forge a successful TV career. Over the next decade Altman worked prolifically in television (and almost exclusively in series dramas) directing multiple episodes of ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', ''[[The Millionaire (TV series)|The Millionaire]]'', ''[[U.S. Marshal (TV series)|U.S. Marshal]]'', ''[[The Troubleshooters (1959 TV series)|The Troubleshooters]]'', ''[[The Roaring 20s (TV series)|The Roaring 20s]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'', ''[[Kraft Mystery Theater]]'', ''[[Combat!]]'', and ''[[Kraft Suspense Theatre]]'', as well as single episodes of several other notable series including ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Surfside 6]]'', ''[[Peter Gunn]], and ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]''.

Through this early work on industrial films and TV series, Altman experimented with narrative technique and developed his characteristic use of overlapping dialogue.  He also learned to work quickly and efficiently on a limited budget. During his TV period, though frequently fired for refusing to conform to network mandates, as well as insisting on expressing political subtexts and antiwar sentiments during the Vietnam years, Altman always was able to gain assignments. In 1964, the producers decided to expand "Once Upon a Savage Night", one of his episodes of ''[[Kraft Suspense Theatre]]'', for theatrical release under the name, ''Nightmare in Chicago''.

Two years later, Altman was hired to direct the low-budget space travel feature ''[[Countdown (1968 film)|Countdown]]'', but was fired within days of the project's conclusion because he had refused to edit the film to a manageable length. He did not direct another film until ''[[That Cold Day in the Park]]'' (1969), which was a critical and box-office disaster.

==Mainstream success==
In 1969 Altman was offered the script for ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'', an adaptation of a little-known [[Korean War]]-era novel satirizing life in the armed services; more than a dozen other filmmakers had passed on it. Altman had been hesitant to take the production, and the shoot was so tumultuous that [[Elliott Gould]] and [[Donald Sutherland]] tried to have Altman fired over his unorthodox filming methods. Nevertheless, ''MASH'' was widely hailed as an immediate classic upon its 1970 release. It won the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' at the 1970 [[Cannes Film Festival]] and netted five [[Academy Award]] nominations. It was Altman's highest-grossing film, released during a time of increasing anti-war sentiment in the United States.

Now recognized as a major talent, Altman notched critical successes with ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), a [[Western movie|Western]] known for its gritty portrayal of the American frontier; ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), a controversial adaptation of the [[Raymond Chandler]] novel (scripted by [[Leigh Brackett]]) now ranked as a seminal influence on the [[neo-noir]] subgenre; ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1974), an adaptation of the Edward Anderson novel previously filmed by [[Nicholas Ray]] as ''[[They Live by Night]]'' (1949); and ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), which had a strong political theme set against the world of [[country music]]. The stars of the film wrote their own songs; [[Keith Carradine]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for the song "[[I'm Easy]]". None of these films grossed in excess of $10 million, but most were profitable; ''Nashville'' grossed over $9.9 million on a $2.2 million budget, a strategy that Altman would depend upon for funding for much of his career. Although his films were often met with divisive notices, many of the prominent film critics of the era (including [[Pauline Kael]], [[Vincent Canby]] and [[Roger Ebert]]) remained steadfastly loyal to his oeuvre throughout the decade.

Audiences took some time to appreciate his films, and he did not want to have to satisfy studio officials. In 1970, following the release of ''MASH,'' he founded Lion's Gate Films to have independent production freedom. Altman's company is not to be confused with the current [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]], a Canada/U.S. entertainment company.<ref>Cook (2000), p. 97.</ref> The films he made through his company included ''[[Brewster McCloud]]'', ''[[A Wedding]]'', ''[[3 Women]]'', and ''[[Quintet (film)|Quintet]]''.

==Later career and renaissance==
[[File:Robert Altman - 1976.jpg|thumb|left|with [[Lillian Gish]] and [[Lily Tomlin]] at ''Nashville'' awards ceremony in 1976]]
In 1980, he directed the musical ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]''. Produced by [[Robert Evans (film producer)|Robert Evans]] and written by [[Jules Feiffer]], the film was based on the comic strip/cartoon [[Popeye|of the same name]] and starred the comedian [[Robin Williams]] in his film debut. Designed as a vehicle to increase Altman's commercial clout following a series of critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful low-budget films in the late 1970s (including ''3 Women'', ''A Wedding'' and ''Quintet''), the production (filmed on location in [[Malta]]) was beleaguered by heavy drug and alcohol use among most of the cast and crew, including the director; Altman reportedly clashed with Evans, Williams (who threatened to leave the film) and songwriter [[Harry Nilsson]] (who departed midway through the shoot, leaving [[Van Dyke Parks]] to finish the orchestrations). Though critically unsuccessful, the film grossed $60 million worldwide on a $20 million budget and was the second highest-grossing film Altman had directed to that point.

In 1981, the director sold Lion's Gate to producer [[Jonathan Taplin]] after his political satire ''[[Health (film)|Health]]'' shot in 1979 was still shelved in 1980 by longtime distributor [[20th Century Fox]] following tepid test screenings in the wake of the departure of his avowed partisan [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] from the studio. Unable to secure major financing in the post-New Hollywood [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] era because of his long-established mercurial reputation and the particularly tumultuous events surrounding the production of ''Popeye'', Altman began to "direct literate dramatic properties on shoestring budgets for stage, home video, television, and limited theatrical release," including the acclaimed ''[[Secret Honor]]'' and ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', an adaptation of a play that Altman had directed on Broadway.<ref name=McGilligan>McGilligan, Patrick.''Robert Altman: Jumping Off the Cliff'', Macmillan (1989)</ref>{{rp|115}} An abortive return to Hollywood filmmaking, the [[buddy film]] ''[[O.C. and Stiggs]]'' was shelved by [[MGM]] for nearly two years and received a belated limited commercial release in 1987. He also garnered a good deal of acclaim for his TV "[[mockumentary]]" ''[[Tanner '88]]'', based on a presidential campaign, for which he earned an [[Emmy Award]] and regained critical favor. Still, widespread popularity with audiences continued to elude him. Altman also co-wrote [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s 1983 hit single "[[Black Sheep (John Anderson song)|Black Sheep]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1546370/nashville-director-robert-altman-dies.jhtml|title=Nashville Director Robert Altman Dies|date=21 November 2006|work=[[Country Music Television]]|accessdate=5 November 2014}}</ref>

He revitalized his career with ''[[The Player (film)|The Player]]'' (1992), a satire of Hollywood. Co-produced by the influential [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] (''[[The Sting]]'', ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''), the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].  While he did not win the Oscar, he was awarded Best Director by the [[Cannes Film Festival]], [[BAFTA]], and the [[New York Film Critics Circle]].

Altman then directed ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993), an ambitious adaptation of several short stories by [[Raymond Carver]], which portrayed the lives of various citizens of Los Angeles over the course of several days. The film's large cast and intertwining of many different storylines were similar to his large-cast films of the 1970s; he won the [[Golden Lion]] at the 1993 [[Venice International Film Festival]] and another Oscar nomination for Best Director. In 1996, Altman directed ''[[Kansas City (1996 film)|Kansas City]]'', expressing his love of 1930s jazz through a complicated kidnapping story. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1999.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref>

Altman directed ''[[Gosford Park]]'' (2001), and his portrayal of a large-cast, British country house mystery was included on many critics' lists of the ten best films of that year. It won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay ([[Julian Fellowes]]) plus six more nominations, including two for Altman, as Best Director and Best Picture.

Working with independent studios such as the now-shuttered Fine Line, Artisan (which was absorbed into today's [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]), and USA Films (now [[Focus Features]]), gave Altman the edge in making the kinds of films he has always wanted to make without studio interference.  A [[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|film version]] of [[Garrison Keillor]]'s public radio series ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' was released in June 2006.  Altman was still developing new projects up until his death, including a film based on ''[[Hands on a Hard Body: The Documentary]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=19678|title=Robert Altman Has A Hard Body|publisher=Empire}}</ref>

In 2006, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded Altman an [[Academy Honorary Award]] for Lifetime Achievement.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=16729954|title= Robert Altman|publisher= Find A Grave|accessdate= September 29, 2012}}</ref> During his acceptance speech, he revealed that he had received a heart transplant approximately ten or eleven years earlier. The director then quipped that perhaps the Academy had acted prematurely in recognizing the body of his work, as he felt like he might have four more decades of life ahead of him.

==Death==
Altman died on November 20, 2006, at age 81 at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in West Hollywood. According to his production company in New York, Sandcastle 5 Productions, he died of complications from [[leukemia]].

Altman was survived by his wife, Kathryn Reed Altman; six children or step-children: Christine Westphal, [[Mike Altman|Michael Altman]], Stephen Altman (his [[production designer]] of choice for many films), Konni Reed Corriere, [[Robert Reed Altman]], and Matthew Altman; 12 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15831581 |title=Director Robert Altman dies at 81 – More news and other features – MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=November 22, 2006 |accessdate=September 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/11/21/obit.altman.ap/index.html ]{{Dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>

The film director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] dedicated his 2007 film ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'' to Altman.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Smith|editor-first=Ian Haydn|title=International Film Guide: The Definitive Annual Review of World Cinema|page=316|isbn=978-1-905674-61-9|year=2008|accessdate=May 11, 2010|location=London|publisher=Wallflower Press}}</ref> Anderson had worked as a standby director on ''[[A Prairie Home Companion (film)|A Prairie Home Companion]]'' for insurance purposes, in the event the ailing 80-year-old Altman was unable to finish shooting.

==Legacy==
During a celebration tribute to Altman a few months after his death, he was described as a "passionate filmmaker" and [[auteur]] who rejected convention, creating what director [[Alan Rudolph]] called an "Altmanesque" style of films.<ref name=NYT-07/> He preferred large casts of actors, natural overlapping conversations, and encouraged his actors to improvise and express their innate creativity, but without fear of failing. [[Lily Tomlin]] compared him to "a great benign patriarch who was always looking out for you as an actor," adding that "you're not afraid to take chances with him."<ref name=EW>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1562700,00.html "Remembering Robert Altman"], ''Entertainment Weekly'', November 24, 2006</ref>

Many of his films are described as "acid satires and counterculture character studies that redefined and reinvigorated modern cinema."<ref name=EW/> Although his films spanned most film genres, such as Westerns, musicals, war films, or comedies, he was considered "anti-genre," and his films were "candidly subversive." He was known to hate the "phoniness" he saw in most mainstream films, and "he wanted to explode them" through satire.<ref name=NYT-06>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/21/movies/22altmancnd.html?pagewanted=all "Robert Altman, Iconoclastic Director, Dies at 81"], ''New York Times'', November 21, 2006</ref>

Actor [[Tim Robbins]], who starred in a number of Altman's films, describes some of the unique aspects of his directing method:

{{quote|He created a unique and wonderful world on his sets, . . . where the mischievous dad unleashed the "children actors" to play. Where your imagination was encouraged, nurtured, laughed at, embraced and Altman-ized. A sweet anarchy that many of us hadn't felt since the schoolyard, unleashed by Bob's wild heart.<ref name=Indiewire>[http://www.indiewire.com/article/an_altmanesque_celebration_for_a_maverick_american_director_robert_altman_1 "An Altmanesque Celebration For A Maverick American Director: Robert Altman, 1925 – 2006"], ''Indiewire'', Feb. 21, 2007</ref>}}

Altman's personal archives are located at the [[University of Michigan]], which include about 900 boxes of personal papers, scripts, legal, business and financial records, photographs, props and related material. Altman had filmed ''Secret Honor'' at the university, as well as directed several operas there.<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/news/columnists/mike_hendricks/story/1155383.html KC native Altman's papers heading for Michigan, not KC – Kansascity.com – April 21, 2009]{{Dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>

==Directing style and technique==

===Maverick and auteur===
Following his successful career in television, Altman began his new career in the movie industry when he was in middle-age. He understood the creative limits imposed by the television genre, and now set out to direct and write films which would express his personal visions about American society and Hollywood. His films would later be described as "[[auteur]]istic attacks" and "idiosyncratic variations" of traditional films, typically using subtle comedy or satire as a way of expressing his observations.<ref name=Wakeman>John Wakeman, ed. ''World Film Directors – Vol. 2'', H.W. Wilson Co., N.Y. (1988) pp. 29–39</ref>

His films were typically related to political, ideological, and personal subjects, and Altman was known for "refusing to compromise his own artistic vision."<ref name=Hillstrom/> He has been described as "anti-Hollywood," often ignoring the social pressures that affected others in the industry, which made it more difficult for him to get many of his films seen. However, he still felt that his independence as a filmmaker did him little harm overall:

{{quote|I don't think there's a filmmaker alive, or who ever lived, who's had a better shake than I've had. I've never been without a project and it's always been a project of my own choosing. So I don't know how much better it could be. I have not become a mogul, I don't build castles and I don't have a vast personal fortune, but I have been able to do what I've wanted to do and I've done it a lot.<ref name=Stevens/>}}

"Altman was a genuine movie maverick," states author [[Ian Freer]], because he went against the commercial conformity of the movie industry: "He was the scourge of the film establishment, and his work generally cast an astute, scathing eye over the breadth of American culture, often exploding genres and character archetypes; Altman was fascinated by people with imperfections, people as they really are, not as the movies would have you believe."<ref name=Freer>Freer, Ian. ''Moviemakers'', Quercus, London, (2009) pp. 106–109</ref> Director [[Alan Rudolph]], during a special tribute to Altman, refers to his moviemaking style as "Altmanesque."<ref name=NYT-07>Carr, David. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/movies/21altman.html?_r=0 "A Very Altmanesque Tribute to Altman"], ''New York Times'', February 21, 2007</ref>

With his independent style of directing, he developed a bad reputation among screenwriters and those on the business side of films. He admits, "I have a bad reputation with writers, developed over the years: 'Oh, he doesn't do what you write, blah blah blah.' . . . . [[Ring Lardner, Jr.|Ring Lardner]] was very pissed off with me," for not following his script.<ref name=Thompson/>{{rp|18}} Nor did Altman get along well with studio heads, once punching an executive in the nose and knocking him into a swimming pool because he insisted he cut six minutes from a film he was working on.<ref name=Armstrong/>{{rp|9}}

His reputation among actors is quite different, however. With them, his independence sometimes extended to his choice of actors, often going against consensus. [[Cher]], for instance, credits him for launching her career with both the stage play and film, ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'' (1982). "Without Bob I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me. Everyone. . . . Nobody would give me a break. I am convinced that Bob was the only one who was brave enough to do it." Others, like [[Julianne Moore]], describes working with him:

{{quote|You know, all this talk about Bob being this kind of irascible, difficult kind of person? Well, he was never that way with an actor or with a creative person that I saw. Never, never, never. He saved all that for the money people.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|431}}}}

However, director [[Robert Dornhelm]] states, Altman "looked at film as a pure, artistic venue." With ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993), for instance, the distributor "begged him" to cut a few minutes from the length, to keep it commercially viable: "Bob just thought the Antichrist was trying to destroy his art. They were well-meaning people who wanted him to get what he deserved, which was a big commercial hit. But when it came down to the art or the money, he was with the art."<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|438}}

[[Sally Kellerman]], noting Altman's willful attitude, still looks back with regret at giving up a chance to act in one of his films:

{{quote|I had just finished filming ''[[Last of the Red Hot Lovers]]'' when Bob called me one day at home. "Sally, do you want to be in my picture after next?" he asked. "Only if it's a good part," I said. He hung up on me.<br>
Bob was as stubborn and arrogant as I was at the time, but the sad thing is that I cheated myself out of working with someone I loved so much, someone who made acting both fun and easy and who trusted his actors. Bob loved actors. Stars would line up to work for nothing for Bob Altman.<ref>Kellerman, Sally. ''Read My Lips: Stories of a Hollywood Life'', Weinstein Books (2013) p. 146</ref>}}

===Themes and subjects===
Unlike directors whose work fits within various [[film genre]]s, such as Westerns, musicals, war films, or comedies, Altman's work has been defined as more "anti-genre" by various critics.<ref name=Hillstrom/> This is partly due to the satirical and comedy nature of many of his films. [[Geraldine Chaplin]], daughter of [[Charlie Chaplin]], compared the humor in his films to her father's films:

{{quote|They're funny in the right way. Funny in a critical way—of what the world is and the world we live in. They were both geniuses in their way. They alter your experience of reality. They have their world and they have their humor. That humor is so rare.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|287}}}}

Altman made it clear that he did not like "storytelling" in his films, contrary to the way most television and mainstream movies are made. According to Altman biographer [[Mitchell Zuckoff]], "he disliked the word 'story,' believing that a plot should be secondary to an exploration of pure (or, even better, impure) human behavior."<ref name=Zuckoff>Zuckoff, Mitchell. ''Robert Altman: the Oral Biography'', Alfred A. Knopf (2009)</ref>{{rp|xiii}} Zuckoff describes the purposes underlying many of Altman's films: "He loved the chaotic nature of real life, with conflicting perspectives, surprising twists, unexplained actions, and ambiguous endings. He especially loved many voices, sometimes arguing, sometimes agreeing, ideally overlapping, a cocktail party or a street scene captured as he experienced it.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|xiii}} [[Julianne Moore]], after seeing some of his movies, credits Altman's style of directing for her decision to become a film actress, rather than a stage actress:

{{quote|I felt it really strongly. And I thought, "I don't know who this guy is, but that's what I want to do. I want to do that kind of work." From then on I'd see his films whenever I could, and he was always my absolute favorite director, for what he said thematically and emotionally and how he felt about people.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|324}}}}

Film author Charles Derry writes that Altman's films "characteristically contain perceptive observations, telling exchanges, and moments of crystal clear revelation of human folly."<ref name=Hillstrom/> Because Altman was an astute observer of society and "especially interested in people," notes Derry, many of his film characters had "that sloppy imperfection associated with human beings as they are, with life as it is lived."<ref name=Hillstrom/> As a result, his films are often an indirect critique of American society.

For many of Altman's films, the satirical content is evident: ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), for example, is a satirical black comedy set during the Korean War; ''[[McCabe & Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971) is a satire on Westerns;<ref name=Wood>Wood, Robin. [http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/film/movie/contents/mashed_marlowe_wood.pdf ''Movie: A Journal of Film Criticism''] 2, November 23, 1973</ref> author [[Matthew Kennedy (author)|Matthew Kennedy]] states that ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) is a "brilliant satire of America immediately prior to the Bicentennial";<ref>Kennedy, Matthew. [http://brightlightsfilm.com/32/nashville.php#.UilBRNJJOSo ''The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman’s Masterpiece''], book review, April 2001</ref> ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978) is a satire on American marriage rituals and hypocrisy;<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1023299-wedding/ ''A Wedding''], review by Rotten Tomatoes;</ref> Altman himself said that [[The Player (film)|''The Player'']] (1992) was "a very mild satire" about the Hollywood film industry, and [[Vincent Canby]] agreed, stating that "as a satire, ''The Player'' tickles. It doesn't draw blood."<ref>Canby, Vincent. [http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CE5DE1538F933A25757C0A964958260 "The Player" movie review], ''New York Times'', April 10, 1992</ref> However, the satire of his films sometimes led to their failure at the box office if their satirical nature was not understood by the distributor. Altman blames the box office failure of [[The Long Goodbye (film)|''The Long Goodbye'']] (1973), a detective story, on the erroneous marketing of the film as a thriller:

{{quote|When the picture opened, it was a big, big flop. . . I went to David Picker and said, "You can't do this. No wonder the fucking picture is failing. It's giving the wrong impression. You make it look like a thriller and it's not, it's a satire.<ref name=Thompson/>}}

Similarly, Altman also blames the failure of ''[[O.C. & Stiggs]]'' on its being marketed as a typical "teenage movie," rather than what he filmed it as, a "satire of a teenage movie," he said.<ref name=Thompson/>

===Improvisation and natural dialogue===
Altman favored stories expressing the interrelationships among several characters, being more interested in character motivation than in intricate plots. He therefore tended to sketch out only a basic plot for the film, referring to the screenplay as a "blueprint" for action. By encouraging his actors to improvise dialogue, Altman thus became known as an "actor's director," a reputation that attracted many notable actors to work as part of his large casts. Performers enjoy working with Altman in part because "he provides them with the freedom to develop their characters and often alter the script through improvisation and collaboration," notes Derry. [[Richard Baskin]] says that "Bob was rather extraordinary in his way of letting people do what they did. He trusted you to do what you did and therefore you would kill for him."<ref name=Hillstrom/>

<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|282}} [[Geraldine Chaplin]], who acted in ''Nashville'', recalls one of her first rehearsal sessions:

{{quote|He said, "Have you brought your scripts?" We said yes. He said, "Well, throw them away. You don't need them. You need to know who you are and where you are and who you're with." . . . It was like being onstage with a full house every second. All the circus acts you had inside your body you'd do just for him.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|282}}}}

Altman regularly let his actors develop a character through improvisation during rehearsal or sometimes during the actual filming.<ref name=Armstrong>Armstrong, Rick, editor, ''Robert Altman: Critical Essays'', McFarland (2011) pp. 12, 21</ref> Such improvisation was uncommon in film due to the high cost of movie production which requires careful planning, precise scripts, and rehearsal, before costly film was exposed. Nevertheless, Altman preferred to use improvisation as a tool for helping his actors develop their character.<ref>Sterritt, David. ''Screening the Beats: Media Culture and the Beat Sensibility'', Southern Illinois University Press (2004) p. 70</ref> Altman said that "once we start shooting it's a very set thing. Improvisation is misunderstood. We don't just turn people loose."<ref name=Stevens>Stevens, George Jr. ''Conversations at the American Film Institute with the Great Moviemakers'', Random House (2012) pp. 3–16</ref> Although he tried to avoid dictating an actor's every move, preferring to let them be in control:

{{quote|When I cast a film, most of my creative work is done. I have to be there to turn the switch on and give them encouragement as a father figure, but they do all the work. . . . All I'm trying to do is make it easy on the actor, because once you start to shoot, the actor is the artist. . . . I have to give them confidence and see that they have a certain amount of protection so they can be creative. . . . I let them do what they became actors for in the first place: to create.<ref name=Stevens/>}}

[[Carol Burnett]] remembers Altman admitting that many of the ideas in his films came from the actors. "You never hear a director say that. That was truly an astonishing thing," she said.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|328}} Others, such as [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], became creatively driven:

{{quote|He would inspire you out of sheer necessity to come up with stuff that you didn't know you were capable of, that you didn't know you had in you. He was so genuinely mischievous and so damn funny.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|435}}}}

He liked working with many of the same performers for other films, including [[Elliott Gould]], [[Sally Kellerman]], [[Keith Carradine]], [[Shelley Duvall]] and [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]. Krin Gabbard adds that Altman enjoyed using actors "who flourish as improvisers," such as Elliott Gould, who starred in three of his films, ''MASH'', ''The Long Goodbye'' and ''California Split''.<ref name=Armstrong/> Gould recalls that when filming ''MASH'', his first acting job with Altman, he and costar [[Donald Sutherland]] didn't think Altman knew what he was doing. He wrote years later, "I think that in hindsight, Donald and I were two elitist, arrogant actors who really weren't getting Altman's genius."<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|174}} Others in the cast immediately appreciated Altman's directing style. [[René Auberjonois]] explains:

{{quote|We thought that's the way movies were. That they were that joyous an experience. If you had any kind of career, you quickly saw that most directors don't really trust actors, don't really want to see actors acting. That was the difference with Bob Altman. He loved actors and wanted to see acting.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|175}}}}

Unlike television and traditional films, Altman also avoided "conventional storytelling," and would opt for showing the "busy confusion of real life," observes Albert Lindauer.<ref name=Wakeman/> Among the various techniques to achieve this effect, his films often include "a profusion of sounds and images, by huge casts or crazy characters, multiple plots or no plots at all, . . . and a reliance on improvisation."<ref name=Wakeman/> A few months before he died, Altman tried to summarize the motives behind his filmmaking style:

{{quote|I equate this work more with painting than with theater or literature. Stories don't interest me. Basically, I'm more interested in behavior. I don't direct, I watch. I have to be thrilled if I expect the audience to be thrilled. Because what I really want to see from an actor is something I've never seen before, so I can't tell them what it is. I try to encourage actors not to take turns. To deal with conversation as conversation. I mean, that's what the job is, I think. It's to make a comfort area so that an actor can go beyond what he thought he could do.<ref name=Zuckoff/>{{rp|8}}}}

===Realistic sound and large casts===
Altman was one of the few filmmakers who "paid full attention to the possibilities of sound" when filming.<ref name=Freer/> He tried to replicate natural conversational sounds, even with large casts, by wiring hidden microphones to actors, then recording them talking over each other with multiple soundtracks.<ref name=Freer/> During the filming, he wore a headset to ensure that important dialogue could be heard, without emphasizing it. This produced a "dense audio experience" for viewers, allowing them to hear multiple scraps of dialogue, as if they were listening in on various private conversations. Altman recognized that although large casts hurt a film commercially, "I like to see a lot of stuff going on."<ref name=Stevens/>

Altman first used overlapping soundtracks in [[MASH (film)|''MASH'']] (1970), a sound technique which movie author Michael Barson describes as "a breathtaking innovation at the time."<ref name=Barson>Barson, Michael. ''The Illustrated Who's Who of Hollywood Directors'', Noonday Press (1995) pp.12–15</ref> He developed it, Altman said, to force viewers to pay attention and become engaged in the film as if they were an active participant.<ref name=Wakeman/> According to some critics, one of the more extreme uses of the technique is in ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), also considered among his finest films.<ref name=Hillstrom>Hillstrom, Laurie Collier. ed. ''International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers – vol. 2'', St. James Press (1997) pp. 12–17</ref>

However, overlapping dialogue among large groups of actors adds complexity to Altman's films, and they were often criticized as appearing haphazard or disconnected on first viewing. Some of his critics, however, changed their mind after seeing them again. British film critic, [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]], gave [[Nashville (film)|''Nashville'']] (1975) a bad review after watching it the first time, but later wrote, "But going back to ''Nashville'' and some of the earlier films, . . . made me reflect: It remains enigmatic how organized or purposeful ''Nashville'' is. . . . The mosaic, or mix, permits a freedom and a human idiosyncrasy that [[Jean Renoir|Renoir]] might have admired."<ref name=Thomson>Thomson, David. ''The New Biographical Dictionary of Film'', Alfred A. Knopf, N.Y. (2002) pp. 13–14</ref> During the making of the film, the actors were inspired, and co-star [[Ronee Blakley]] was convinced of the film's ultimate success:

{{quote|Yes, I did think it was going to be great, all the work was so good, every actor was inspired, and Altman's team was intensely competent, and he was that rare kind of genius who knows what works and what doesn't at the moment it is happening.<ref>[http://blogs.indiewire.com/mediamatrix/00000142-1f59-d3e8-a77e-1ffb2ab80000 "Ronee Blakley Reflects About Robert Altman's epic film 'Nashville'"], ''Indiewire'', Nov. 3, 2013</ref>}}

Thomson later recognized those aspects as being part of Altman's style, beginning with [[MASH (film)|''MASH'']] (1970): "''MASH'' began to develop the crucial Altman style of overlapping, blurred sound and images so slippery with zoom that there was no sense of composition. That is what makes ''Nashville'' so absorbing."<ref name=Thomson/> Altman explained that to him such overlapping dialogue in his films was closer to reality, especially with large groups: "If you've got fourteen people at a dinner table, it seems to me it's pretty unlikely that only two of them are going to be talking."<ref name=Stevens/> [[Pauline Kael]] writes that Altman, "the master of large ensembles, loose action, and overlapping voices, demonstrates that . . . he can make film fireworks out of next to nothing."<ref name=Wakeman/>

===Photography===
Altman's distinctive style of directing carried over into his preferences for camerawork. Among them was his use of widescreen compositions, intended to capture the many people or activities taking place on screen at the same time. For some films, such as ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'', he created a powerful visual atmosphere with cinematographer [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], such as scenes using fluid camerawork, zoom lenses, and a smoky effect using special fog filters.<ref name=Frost>Frost, Jacqueline B. ''Cinematography for Directors: A Guide for Creative Collaboration'', Michael Wiese Productions (2009) pp. 46, 221</ref> Director [[Stanley Kubrick]] told Altman that "the camerawork was wonderful," and asked, "How did you do it?"<ref name=Rogers/>

In ''Nashville'', Altman used sets with noticeable colors of reds, whites and blues. For ''The Long Goodbye'', he insisted that Zsigmond keep the camera mobile by mounting it to moving objects.<ref name=Hillstrom/> Zsigmond states that Altman "wanted to do something different" in this film, and told him he "wanted the camera to move—all the time. Up. down. In and out. Side to side."<ref name=Rogers/> Cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]], discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, "I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a zoom lens if it was that observational, roving kind of look that Robert Altman was known for. He'd put the camera on a jib arm and float across the scene and pick out these shots as he went along – quite a nice way of working."<ref name=Frost/>

Zsigmond also recalls that working with Altman was fun:

{{quote|We rather enjoyed doing things "improv." Altman is a great improviser. During the first few days of the shoot, he would "create" different approaches on a moment's notice. He would show me how he wanted the camera to move—always move. Which was fun. The actors loved it, and I was always challenged to find ways to shoot what Altman came up with.<ref name=Rogers>Rogers, Pauline S. ''More Contemporary Cinematographers on Their Art'', Focal Press (2000) pp. 178–179</ref>}}

Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography in ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' received a nomination by the [[British Academy Film Awards]].

===Music scores===
When using music in his films, Altman was known to be highly selective, often choosing music that he personally liked. Director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], who worked with him, notes that "Altman's use of music is always important, adding, "Bob loved his music, didn't he? My God, he loved his music".<ref name=Armstrong/> Since he was a "great fan" of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s music, for example, saying he would "just get stoned and play that stuff" all the time<ref name=Thompson>Thompson, David. ''Altman on Altman'', Faber & Faber (2010) ebook</ref> he used three of his songs in ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971), and another for the final scene in ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978).<ref>Simmons, Sylvie. ''I'm Your Man: The Life of Leonard Cohen'', Random House  (2012) Ch. 13</ref>

For ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), Altman had numerous new country music songs written by his cast to create a realistic atmosphere. He incorporated a "hauntingly repeated melody" in ''[[The Long Goodbye (film)|The Long Goodbye]]'' (1973), and employed [[Harry Nilsson]] and [[Van Dyke Parks]] to score ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980).<ref>McGilligan, Patrick. ''Robert Altman: Jumping Off the Cliff'', Macmillan (1989) p. 347</ref>

A number of music experts have written about Altman's use of music, including Richard R. Ness, who wrote about the scores for many of Altman's films in an article, considered to be a valuable resource for understanding Altman's filmmaking technique.<ref>Ness, Richard R. "Doing Some Replacin", in ''Robert Altman: Critical Essays'', ed. Rick Armstrong, McFarland, (2011) pp. 38–59</ref> Similarly, cinema studies professor Krin Gabbard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cat/people/cat_faculty/KrinGabbard.html |title=Krin Gabbard: Stony Brook University |publisher=Stonybrook.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}</ref> wrote an analysis of Altman's use of Jazz music in ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993), noting that few critics have considered the "importance of the music" in the film.<ref name=Armstrong/>

[[File:Robert Altman Cannes.jpg|thumb|upright|Altman at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival]]
Jazz was also significant in ''[[Kansas City (1996 film)|Kansas City]]'' (1996). In that film, the music is considered to be the basis of the story. Altman states that "the whole idea was not to be too specific about the story," but to have the film itself be "rather a sort of jazz."<ref name=Self>Self, Robert T. ''Robert Altman's Subliminal Reality'', Univ. of Minnesota Press (2002) p. 9</ref> Altman's technique of making the theme of a film a form of music, was considered "an experiment nobody has tried before," with Altman admitting it was risky. "I didn't know if it would work. . . . If people 'get it,' then they really tend to like it."<ref name=Altman>Altman, Robert. ''Robert Altman: Interviews'', Univ. Press of Mississippi (2000) p. 212</ref>

==Personal life==
In the 1960s, Altman lived for years in [[Mandeville Canyon]] in [[Brentwood, Los Angeles, California|Brentwood, California]].<ref>Peter Biskind, ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', New York: Touchstone Books, 1998</ref>  He resided in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] throughout the 1970s but sold that home and the Lion's Gate production company in 1981. "I had no choice", he told the ''[[New York Times]]''. "Nobody was answering the phone" after the flop of ''Popeye''.  He moved his family and business headquarters to New York City, but eventually moved back to Malibu, where he lived until his death. Altman despised the phenomenally popular television series ''[[M*A*S*H]]'' which followed his popular 1970 film, citing it as being the antithesis for what his movie was about, and citing its anti-war messages as being "racist." He stated very clearly in the 2001 DVD commentary of ''MASH'' his disapproval and the reasons why for the series.

In November 2000, he claimed that he would move to Paris if [[George W. Bush]] were elected, but joked that he had meant [[Paris, Texas]] when it came to pass. He noted that "the state would be better off if he (Bush) is out of it."<ref>http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/outrage/leave.htm</ref> Altman was an outspoken [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] user, and served as a member of the [[NORML]] advisory board. He was also an atheist and an anti-war activist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Still up to mischief (Suzie Mackenzie interviewing Altman)|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/may/01/features.weekend|work=The Guardian|accessdate=May 1, 2013|author=Suzie Mackenzie|date=May 1, 2004|quote=Still, it's worth noting that by the age of 20 this whistle- blower had resisted two of the most powerful institutions – church and army, both.
