Egoyan was born to [[Armenians|Armenian]] parents in Egypt.  His family moved to Canada when he was two years old. His work often explores themes of [[social alienation|alienation]] and [[solitude|isolation]], featuring characters whose interactions are mediated through technology, bureaucracy or other power structures. Egoyan's films often follow non-linear plot structures, in which events are placed out of sequence in order to elicit specific emotional reactions from the audience by withholding key information.<ref name="faculty"/>

Egoyan's most critically acclaimed film is the drama ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'' (1997),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/jan/21/atom-egoyan-adoration-chloe | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Cath | last=Clarke | title=The double life of Atom Egoyan | date=January 21, 2010}}</ref> and his biggest commercial success is the erotic thriller ''[[Chloe (film)|Chloe]]'' (2009).<ref name="Pevere">{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/article/901059--the-digital-revolution-film | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Geoff | last=Pevere | title=The Digital Revolution: Part 1 | date=December 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>http://lci.tf1.fr/cinema/news/atom-egoyan-ryan-reynolds-m-a-semble-une-evidence-8542522.html</ref>  Egoyan has been nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]: Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, both for ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]''.

In 2008 Egoyan received the [[Dan David Prize]] for "Creative Rendering of the Past".<ref>[http://www.dandavidprize.org/index.php/laureates/laureates-2008/56-2008-past-creative-rendering-of-the-past-literature-theater-film/72-past-2008-creative-rendering-of-the-past-literature-theater-film.html Dan David Prize Official site, Atom Egoyan]</ref>

==Life and career==
Egoyan was born '''Atom Yeghoyan''' ([[Western Armenian|Western]] {{lang-hy|Աթոմ Եղոյեան}}) in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], the son of Shushan (née Devletian) and Joseph Yeghoyan, artists who operated a furniture store.<ref>http://www.filmreference.com/film/5/Atom-Egoyan.html</ref> His parents were [[Armenians|Armenian]]-Egyptians, and he was named Atom to mark the completion of Egypt's first nuclear reactor.<ref>{{cite book|title=Toronto|year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|location=Footscray, Vic., Australia|isbn=9781740598354|page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=0twBxkXe5DsC&pg=PA28&dq=atom+egoyan+egypt+reactor&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zp8ZUoLDNofu9AT-w4CYBg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=atom%20egoyan%20egypt%20reactor&f=false 28]|author=Charles Rawlings-Way, Natalie Karneef|edition=3rd ed.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ATOM EGOYAN - BIOGRAPHY|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/atom-egoyan/biography/|publisher=[[European Graduate School]]|accessdate=25 August 2013|quote=Atom Egoyan’s name was a symbolic choice by his parents, named after the new nuclear reactor in Egypt.}}</ref> In 1962, however, his parents left Egypt for Canada, where they settled in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]] and changed their last name to Egoyan. Atom and his sister, Eve, now a concert pianist based in Toronto, were raised by their parents in [[British Columbia]].

As a boy, Egoyan wished for assimilation into Canadian society and his struggle with his father led him to reject his family's Armenian culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  However, years later, when he attended the University of Toronto, he began to study Armenian history.<ref>Interview with [[Eleanor Wachtel]] on [[CBC Radio One]]'s programme ''[[Ideas (radio show)|Ideas]]'' on February 9, 2010. cf. http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/. Retrieved 2010-02-14.</ref>

As a teenager, he became interested in reading and writing plays.  Significant influences included [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Harold Pinter]]. Egoyan also attributes his future in the film industry to [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s film [[Persona (film)|''Persona'']], which he viewed at age fourteen, according to an interview he had with journalist [[Robert K. Elder]] for ''[[The Film That Changed My Life]]''.

<blockquote>It gave me an incredible respect for the medium and its possibilities. To me, Persona marries a pure form and a very profound vision with absolute conviction. It’s very inspiring. I felt that it was able to open a door that wasn’t there before.<ref>Egoyan, Atom. Interview by Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life. By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p179. Print.</ref></blockquote>

He graduated from [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. It was at Trinity College that Egoyan came into contact with Harold Nahabedian, the Armenian-Canadian Anglican Chaplain of Trinity College. In interviews Egoyan credited Nahabedian for introducing him to the language and history of his ethnic heritage. Egoyan also wrote for the University of Toronto's independent weekly, ''[[The Newspaper]]'', during his time at the school.

Egoyan is now based in [[Toronto]], where he lives with his wife [[Arsinée Khanjian]], a trilingual (English, French and Armenian) Armenian-Canadian actress who appears in many of Egoyan's films, and their son, Arshile (named after the Armenian-American painter [[Arshile Gorky]]), who attends the [[Toronto French School]]. In 1999, Egoyan was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].

Egoyan has directed a dozen full-length films, several television episodes, and a few shorter pieces. His early work was based on his own material. In 1984, his debut film  "Next of Kin" worldpremiered at the [[International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg]] and won a major prize. He received some notice for the film ''[[Exotica (movie)|Exotica]]'' (1994). He received the [[Grand Prix (Belgian Film Critics Association)]] in [[Brussels]] and held on this occasion a conference at    [[Ric's Art Boat]].  But it was Egoyan's first attempt at adapted material that resulted in his best-known work, ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'' (1997), which earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Adapted Screenplay]].

He also directed ''[[Inspired by Bach|Sarabande]]'' featuring Khanjian, [[Lori Singer]], and cellist [[Yo-Yo Ma]]'s performance of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach's]] ''[[Cello Suites (Bach)#Suite No. 4 in E-flat major.2C BWV 1010|Fourth Suite for Unaccompanied Cello]]'', as part of the latter's ''[[Inspired by Bach]]'' film series for Sony Classical.

The film ''[[Ararat (movie)|Ararat]]'' (2002) generated much publicity for Egoyan. After [[Henri Verneuil]]'s French-language film ''[[Mayrig]]'' (1991), it was the first major motion picture to deal directly with the [[Armenian Genocide]]. ''[[Ararat (movie)|Ararat]]'' later won the Best Picture prize at the [[Genie Awards]].

In 2004 Egoyan opened Camera Bar, a 50-seat cinema-lounge on [[Queen Street West]] in Toronto.

In 2005 Egoyan joined the faculty of the media and communications division at [[European Graduate School]] (EGS) in [[Saas-Fee]], Switzerland, where he conducts intensive summer seminars.<ref name="faculty"/> Beginning in September 2006, Egoyan taught at the [[University of Toronto]] for three years.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/2006/08/17/egoyan-teaching.html Teaching gig just another way to be creative, Egoyan says], August 17, 2006, CBC Arts</ref> He joined the faculty of arts and science as the dean's distinguished visitor in theatre, film, music and visual studies.

In 2006, he received the Master of Cinema Award of the [[International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg]].

Later, he directed the erotic thriller ''[[Chloe (film)|Chloe]]'' (2009), theatrically released by [[Sony Pictures Classics]] on March 26, 2010. This film grossed $3 million in the [[United States]] theatrically and became one of the higher-grossing [[specialty films]] in the United States in 2010<ref>http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=chloe.htm</ref>(according to [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]],  "$3 million is the new $10 million" for specialty films' box office in 2010<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118018219.html?categoryid=3768&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Specialty pics face reduced expectations | first=Andrew | last=Stewart | date=April 24, 2010}}</ref>). Several months after the [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray]] release of ''Chloe'', Atom Egoyan said that ''Chloe'' had made more money than any of his previous films.<ref name="Pevere"/>  The success of ''Chloe'' led Egoyan to receive many scripts of erotic thrillers.<ref>http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100713/100713_chloe_DVD/20100713/</ref> As of 2011 after the release of the  [[West Memphis Three]] from 18 years in prison, Egoyan is to direct a movie about the case called ''[[Devil's Knot (film)|Devil's Knot]]'' starring [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Colin Firth]], based on a book on the case, ''[[Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three]]'' by [[Mara Leveritt]].

Egoyan has won four awards each at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].

In 2012, he directed a production of [[Martin Crimp]]'s ''Cruel and Tender'', starring Khanjian, at [[Canadian Stage]] in Toronto.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2012/01/25/filmmaker_atom_egoyan_loving_his_return_to_directing_live_theatre.html "Filmmaker Atom Egoyan loving his return to directing live theatre"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', January 25, 2012.</ref>

Egoyan appeared at [[Luminato]] Festival in June 2013 for TimesTalks [[Luminato]], and directed the Chinese opera ''Feng Yi Ting'', which had its Canadian premiere at the festival.
