'''Johnny Western''' (born October 28, 1934) is an [[United States|American]] [[Country music|country]] singer-songwriter, musician, actor, and radio show host.  He is a member of the [[Western Music Association Hall of Fame]] and the Country Music Disc Jockey Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

Johnny Western was born Johnny Westerlund in [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]] in [[Lake County, Minnesota|Lake County]] in northeastern [[Minnesota]] but was primarily reared in [[Northfield, Minnesota|Northfield]] in south central Minnesota.<ref name=kfdi5>{{cite web|url=http://www.kfdi.com/get/theranch/page5.asp|title=Country Music & Western Heroes|publisher=KFDI|accessdate=2008-01-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071231083331/http://www.kfdi.com/get/theranch/page5.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-31}}</ref>

His father was an instructor and officer in several [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camps, where Western spent some his earlier years.  He also lived on [[Indian reservations]] along the [[Canada–United States border]].<ref name=cmtbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/western_johnny/bio.jhtml|title=Artists: Biography, Johnny Western|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>

When he was five years old, Western's parents took him to see the western film ''Guns and Guitars'', which starred the actor/singer [[Gene Autry]]. The young boy decided he wanted to be a singing cowboy. At the age of twelve, he received a guitar. Within a year, he was performing professionally.<ref name="cmtbio" />

==Musical career==
Johnny Western's professional career began as a young teenager, singing and playing [[rhythm guitar]] with a collegiate singing trio. He got a job on radio at the age of thirteen,<ref name=boothill>{{cite web|url=http://www.boothill.org/hof_western.html|title=Johnny Western, Cowboy Entertainer|publisher=Boot Hill Museum & Front Street|accessdate=2008-01-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080123163512/http://www.boothill.org/hof_western.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-23}}</ref> a feat publicized in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the youngest disc jockey and singer on American radio.<ref name="cmtbio" /> At age sixteen, Western began performing with the [[Sons of the Pioneers]].

He made his first professional recordings in the summer of 1952 in the studio of WCAL Radio station of St. Olaf College of Northfield, Minnesota. The six songs which resulted from those sessions were released on three singles on the local J-O-C-O label.<ref>All information pertaining to Johnny Western's discography is taken from a discography compiled by John L. Smith and Richard Weize, as it was published in the booklet accompanying the Heroes & Cowboys boxed set by Bear Family Records, Germany, 1991.</ref> After having played a supporting role in an episode of "Have Gun, Will Travel," Western wrote "[[The Ballad of Paladin]]" as a musical "Thank-you-card" to Richard Boone. This landed him a deal with Columbia records.

Between August 1958 and May 1963, Western recorded seven singles and one album (''Have Gun Will Travel'', released in May 1962) for Columbia, until he was dropped from their roster. He then signed a contract with the Philipps-label, but only one single resulted ("Light The Fuse" b/w "Tender Years").

''Have Gun Will Travel'' included the haunting [[Stan Jones (songwriter)|Stan Jones]] song "Cowpoke", which members of the [[Western Writers of America]] chose as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.<ref name="Top100">{{Cite web|title=The Top 100 Western Songs |author=Western Writers of America |year=2010|authorlink=Western Writers of America |publisher=American Cowboy|url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6RjFQXqGy|archivedate=10 August 2014|deadurl=yes}}</ref>  The album was a mature work, redolent of Western lore. It also included Western's third version of "The Ballad of Paladin", a fine and introspective performance of "The Lonely Man", the gallows ballad "Hannah Lee", "[[The Streets of Laredo]]", "The Searchers" and "The Last Roundup".<ref name="allmisiccountry">{{cite book |last=Erlewine |first1=Michael |authorlink=Michael Erlewine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C&pg=PA501&lpg=PA501&dq=johnny+western+cowpoke&source=bl&ots=YVz1Yx5gWO&sig=88HLo1Tcbgj3Kcg1UMd9PXcTN7c&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jPzPVPCFCsSqgwSfh4CIDA&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBzgo#v=onepage&q=johnny%20western%20cowpoke&f=false |title=All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Recordings in Country Music |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=1997 |page=501 |accessdate=2015-02-06 }}</ref>

After this, Western was left without a recording contract. Over the years, he recorded various songs for small local labels such as Hep in Missouri or a promo-single for Dodge City. It was not until Johnny Cash invited him to record at his House Of Cash recording studio that Western was able to compile enough material for another LP, which was released under the simple title of "Johnny Western" in 1981. Apart from the House of Cash recordings, it contained some unreleased songs Western had recorded for the Hep-label.

Western's third album was recorded September 17–20, 1984 at Jack Clement Studio in Nashville, with Art Sparer producing. It was released under the title "Johnny Western sings 20 Great Classics & Legends". Amongst others, it contained a new version of Western's own composition "The Gunfighter," featuring Harold Bradley on gut string guitar, imitating the original "El Paso" sound, since Western had originally written that song with Marty Robbins in mind.

His scarce recording output notwithstanding, Johnny Western remained a consistent performer for over sixty years and so his name was never lost on the general public.

He performed with Gene Autry and was a part of the [[Johnny Cash]] road show from 1958 until 1997.  He wrote and performed the theme song "[[The Ballad of Paladin]]" for the [[CBS]] television program ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'', with [[Richard Boone]]. In collaboration with Johnny Cash, he re-wrote the lyrics of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Bonanza]]'' and the theme song, "The Rebel - Johnny Yuma", from the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'', starring [[Nick Adams (actor)|Nick Adams]].<ref name="boothill" />

In October 2013, Johnny Western announced that he would stop touring and giving concerts.<ref>cf. information on: www.johnnywesterntouring.com, retrieved December 23, 2013.</ref>
