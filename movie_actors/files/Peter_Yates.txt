'''Peter James Yates''' (24 July 1929<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Baxter |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jan/10/peter-yates-obituary |title=Peter Yates obituary |date=10 January 2011 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> – 9 January 2011) was an English film director and producer. He was born in [[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Sheldon |last=Hall |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/827219/ |title=Yates, Peter (1928<nowiki>[sic]</nowiki>–2011) |work=BFI screenonline |accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref>

==Life and career==
The son of an army officer, he attended [[Charterhouse School]] as a boy, graduated from the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] and worked for some years as an actor, director and stage manager. In the 1950s he started in the [[film industry]] as a dubbing assistant and later an assistant director for [[Tony Richardson]] and [[J. Lee Thompson]] (his 1961 ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]''<ref name="Three Peter Yates Films Every Movie Fan Should See">{{cite web |url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2011/01/peter-yates-1929-2011 |title=Three Peter Yates Films Every Movie Fan Should See |accessdate=28 December 2013 |work=ifc.com}}</ref>).

''[[Summer Holiday (1963 film)|Summer Holiday]]'' (1963), his first film as director, was a "lightweight"<ref>{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Child |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jan/10/peter-yates-bullitt-director-dies |title=Bullitt director Peter Yates dies aged 82 |work=The Guardian |date=10 January 2011}}</ref> vehicle for [[Cliff Richard]]. Yates had directed the original [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]] production of [[N.F. Simpson]]'s play ''[[One Way Pendulum]]'' and was chosen to make the [[One Way Pendulum|film version]] released in 1964. ''[[Robbery (1967 film)|Robbery]]'' (1967), a crime thriller, is a fictionalised version of the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbery]] of 1963. This led to ''[[Bullitt]]'' (1968), of which Bruce Weber has written, "Mr. Yates’s reputation probably rests most securely on “Bullitt” (1968), his first American film – and indeed, on one particular scene, an extended car chase that instantly became a classic."<ref name=Weber>{{cite news |last=Weber |first=Bruce |title=Peter Yates, Filmmaker, Is Dead at 81 |date=11 January 2011 |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/movies/11yates.html }}</ref> [[Frank P. Keller]] won the Academy Award for film editing on ''Bullitt''. After ''[[Bullitt]]'', Yates would do action films, but would intermix them with comedy and drama films.

In 1970 Yates said he would make ''[[Don Quixote]]'' with [[Richard Burton]] but the project stalled.<ref>Peter Waymark. "Burton as Quixote under 'Bullitt' director." Times [London, England] 15 Dec. 1970: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 12 July 2012.</ref> He did finally make a [[Don Quixote (2000 film)|television film]] of the Cervantes novel in 2000, with [[John Lithgow]] as Don Quixote.

Yates was nominated for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction]] for ''Bullitt'' (1968). Yates produced and directed ''[[Breaking Away]]'' (1979), which was nominated for five Academy Awards ("Oscars") including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film|Best Film]] for Yates. Yates also produced and directed ''[[The Dresser]]'' (1983), which was an adaptation of the [[Ronald Harwood]] stage play. The film received seven BAFTA and five Oscar nominations, including the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]] and for Best Direction and the Academy Award for Best Film and for Best Director for Yates. ''[[The Dresser]]'' was also entered into the [[34th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1984/02_programm_1984/02_Programm_1984.html |title=Berlinale: 1984 Programme |accessdate=26 November 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> Other notable films directed by Yates include ''[[Krull (film)|Krull]]'', ''[[The House on Carroll Street]]'', ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]'', ''[[Suspect (1987 film)|Suspect]]'' and ''[[For Pete's Sake (film)|For Pete's Sake]]''.

Yates has two distinct styles — one used for his thriller, action and drama projects which frequently reflects on the principal character's state of alienation with a humanistic perspective — and his expressive and sentimental style which focuses on the moral dilemmas of the characters, predominantly seen in his coming-of-age and other dramatic films.<ref>http://www.theyshootpictures.com</ref>
