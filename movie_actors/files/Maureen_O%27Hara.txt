'''Maureen O'Hara''' (born 17 August 1920) is an Irish film actress and singer. She was first educated at the John Street West Girls' School near [[Thomas Street, Dublin|Thomas Street]] in Dublin's [[The Liberties, Dublin|Liberties Area]]. From the age of 6–17 she trained in drama, music and dance, and at the age of 10 joined the [[Rathmines]] Theatre Company and worked in amateur theatre in the evenings, after her lessons.<ref name="Maureen O'Hara, 'Tis Herself, p.17">Maureen O'Hara, 'Tis Herself, p.17</ref> The famously [[red hair|red-headed]] O'Hara has been noted for playing fiercely passionate heroines with a highly sensible attitude. She often worked with director [[John Ford]] and longtime friend [[John Wayne]]. Her autobiography, '' 'Tis Herself'', was published in 2004 and was a [[New York Times Bestseller]]. She is one of the last living actresses from the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].

Although O'Hara was never nominated for a competitive [[Academy Award]], in November 2014 she was presented with an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Academy Award]] with the inscription "''To Maureen O'Hara, one of Hollywood's brightest stars, whose inspiring performances glowed with passion, warmth and strength''". O'Hara joined [[Myrna Loy]] in being the only actresses to ever receive an Academy Award for acting without having been nominated previously. <ref>[http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/063-25/ "Honorary Award: Maureen O'Hara."] ''Academy Award Acceptance Speech Database.''

==Early life and career==
O'Hara was born as '''Maureen FitzSimons''' on Beechwood Avenue in the Dublin suburb of [[Ranelagh]]<ref>'Tis Herself, p.12 ISBN 978-0-7434-9535-6</ref> and attended school in [[Milltown, Dublin]]. She was the second oldest of the six children of Charles Stewart Parnell FitzSimons and Marguerita Lilburn FitzSimons. Her father was in the clothing business and also bought into [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers Football Club]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=143374|title=Maureen O'Hara|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=5 February 2009}}</ref> a team O'Hara has supported since childhood.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Eoghan|title=We Are Rovers|publisher=Nonsuch|year=2005|chapter=The Converted|page=21/22|quote=A self-confessed tomboy in her youth, Maureen never missed a game. "I was mad about Rovers; I never missed a game. When I was young all I wanted to do was play for Rovers"|isbn=1-84588-510-4}}</ref> Her mother, a former operatic contralto, was a successful women's clothier.  Her siblings were Peggy, the oldest, and younger Charles, Florrie, Margot and Jimmy.  Peggy dedicated her life to a religious order, the Sisters of Charity, and the younger children all went on to receive training at the [[Abbey Theatre]] and the Ena Mary Burke School of Drama and Elocution in Dublin. O'Hara's dream at this time was to be a stage actress. She was first educated at the John Street West Girls' School near [[Thomas Street (Dublin)|Thomas Street]] in Dublin's [[The Liberties|Liberties Area]]. From the age of 6–17 she trained in drama, music and dance, and at the age of 10 joined the [[Rathmines]] Theatre Company and worked in amateur theatre in the evenings, after her lessons.<ref name="Maureen O'Hara, 'Tis Herself, p.17"/>

O'Hara's father was a very practical man and did not entirely support her theatrical aspirations. He insisted that she learn a skill so that she would have something to fall back on to earn a living with in case her experience in the performing arts was not successful. She enrolled in a business school and became a proficient bookkeeper and typist. Those skills proved helpful many years later when she was able to take and transcribe production notes dictated by [[John Ford]] for the screen adaptation of [[Maurice Walsh]]'s short story ''The Quiet Man''.

She did well in her Abbey training and was given an opportunity for a screen test in London. The studio adorned her in a "gold lamé dress with flapping sleeves like wings"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sigillito|first=Gina|title=Daughters of Maeve: 50 Irish Women Who Changed the World|publisher=Citadel|year=2007|chapter=Maureen Fitzsimons O'Hara|page=206/207|quote=While at the Abbey, Maureen was offered a screen test in London at Elstree Studios, which required that she dress in a "gold lamé dress with flapping sleeves like wings."|isbn=1-84588-510-4}}</ref> and heavy makeup with an ornate hair style. Reportedly, her thoughts concerning the incident were, "If this is the movies, I want nothing to do with them!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.users.qwest.net/~aknot/filmbio.htm|title=Maureen O'Hara|publisher=Qwest.net|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> The screen test was deemed to be far from satisfactory; however, actor [[Charles Laughton]] later saw the test and, despite the overdone makeup and costume, was intrigued, paying particular notice to her large and expressive eyes.

[[File:Tyrone Power Maureen O'Hara Black Swan 6.jpg|thumb|230px|With [[Tyrone Power]] in the trailer for ''[[The Black Swan (film)|The Black Swan]]'' (1942)]]

Laughton subsequently asked his business partner [[Erich Pommer]] to see the film clip. Pommer agreed with Laughton and O'Hara was offered an initial seven-year contract with their new company, Mayflower Pictures. Her first major film was ''[[Jamaica Inn (film)|Jamaica Inn]]'' (1939) directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Laughton was so pleased with O'Hara's performance that he cast her in the role of [[Esméralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]] opposite him in ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1939), which was to be filmed at RKO Studios in Hollywood that same year.
After the successful completion of ''Hunchback'', [[World War II]] began, and Laughton, realising that their studio could no longer film in London, sold O'Hara's contract to [[RKO]]. That studio cast her in low-budget films until she was rescued by director [[John Ford]], who cast her as Angharad in ''[[How Green Was My Valley (film)|How Green Was My Valley]]'', which won the 1941 [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Six years later, in 1947, she made what is perhaps her best-remembered film, starring as Doris Walker and the mother of a young [[Natalie Wood]] in [[20th Century Fox]]'s ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'', which, despite being released in May, has become a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] on [[NBC]]. The film also helped to further establish O'Hara's career after the film garnered several awards, including an [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Academy Award Nomination for Best Picture]].

In 1946, she became a [[naturalised]] citizen of the United States and now holds dual citizenship with the US and her native Ireland.

In addition to her acting skills, O'Hara had a soprano voice and described singing as her first love. The studio heads never capitalised on her musical talent, as she was already big box office in other genres of film.  However, she was able to channel her love of singing through television.  In the late '50s and early '60s, she was a guest on musical variety shows with [[Perry Como]], [[Andy Williams]], [[Betty Grable]] and [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]. In 1960, she starred on Broadway in the musical ''Christine'' which ran for 12 performances.  That year she released two successful recordings, ''Love Letters from Maureen O'Hara'' and ''Maureen O'Hara Sings her Favorite Irish Songs''. ''Love Letters from Maureen O'Hara'' has been released on CD in Japan and is now out of print.

An icon of Hollywood's Golden Age, at the height of her career, O'Hara was considered one of the world's most beautiful women. She is often remembered for her onscreen chemistry with [[John Wayne]]. They made five films together between 1948 and 1972: ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]'', ''[[The Quiet Man]]'', ''[[The Wings of Eagles]]'', ''[[McLintock!]]'' and ''[[Big Jake (film)|Big Jake]]''.

==Marriage, retirement and comeback==

In 1939, at the age of 19, O'Hara secretly married Englishman George H. Brown,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010109/ai_n9664815 |title=Obituary: George H. Brown |last=Vallance |first=Tom |date=9 January 2001 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=27 March 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> a film producer, production assistant and occasional scriptwriter whose best known work is the first of Margaret Rutherford's 1960s [[Miss Marple]] mysteries, ''[[Murder She Said]]''. The marriage was annulled in 1941. Later that year, O'Hara married American film director William Houston Price (dialogue director in ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''), but the union ended in 1953, reportedly as a result of his alcohol abuse. They had one child in 1944, a daughter named Bronwyn FitzSimons Price. Bronwyn has one son, Conor Beau FitzSimons, who was born on 8 September 1970. From 1953 until 1967 O'Hara had a relationship with [[Enrique Parra]], a Mexican politician and banker. She wrote in her autobiography; "Enrique saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and brought me back into the warm light of life again. Leaving him was one of the most painful things I have ever had to do."<ref>'' 'Tis Herself'', p.302 ISBN 978-0-7434-9535-6</ref>

She married her third husband, [[Charles F. Blair, Jr.]], on 12 March 1968. Blair was a pioneer of transatlantic aviation, a former Brigadier General of the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]], a former Chief Pilot at [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], and founder and head of the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] airline [[Antilles Air Boats]]. A few years after her marriage to Blair, O'Hara for the most part retired from acting (in the [[special features]] section to the DVD release of ''[[The Quiet Man]]'', a story is recounted that O'Hara retired after longtime collaboraters [[John Wayne]] and [[John Ford]] teased her about being married but not being a good, stay-at-home housewife). Blair died in 1978 while flying a [[Grumman Goose]] for his airline from [[St. Croix]] to [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], crashing after an engine failure. O'Hara was elected CEO and president of the airline, with the added distinction of becoming the first woman president of a scheduled airline in the U.S. Later she sold the airline with the permission of the shareholders.

O'Hara remained retired from acting until 1991, when she starred in the film ''[[Only the Lonely (film)|Only the Lonely]]'', playing Rose Muldoon, the domineering mother of a Chicago cop played by [[John Candy]]. In the following years, she continued to work, starring in several made-for-TV movies, including ''[[The Christmas Box]]'', ''Cab for Canada'' and ''The Last Dance,'' the latter her last film to date, released in 2000.

Now retired, she has homes in [[Arizona]] and the [[Virgin Islands]], but lived mainly in [[Glengarriff]], [[County Cork]], after suffering a stroke in 2005.<ref name="irishexaminer1">{{cite web|last=Ryan |first=Conor |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/oharas-former-aide-fears-for-stars-wellbeing-208398.html |title=O'Hara's former aide fears for star's wellbeing |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=21 September 2012 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> In June 2011, she participated at the Maureen O'Hara Film Festival in Glengarriff.<ref>[http://meathtoday.com/maureen-o-hara-film-festival-a-must-see/ Maureen O’ Hara Film Festival, A Must See!]</ref>

In May 2012, O'Hara's family contacted [[social workers]] regarding claims that O'Hara, who has short-term memory loss, was a victim of [[elder abuse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Actress-Maureen-OHara-a-victim-of-elder-abuse-family-claim-150741045.html |title=Actress Maureen O'Hara a victim of elder abuse family claim &#124; Irish News |publisher=IrishCentral |date= |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> In September 2012, O'Hara flew to the US after receiving doctor's permission to fly. She lives with her grandson, Conor Beau FitzSimons, in Idaho.<ref name="irishexaminer1"/>

On 24–25 May 2013, O'Hara made a public appearance at the 2013 John Wayne Birthday "Tribute to Maureen O'Hara" celebration in [[Winterset, Iowa]]. The occasion was the ground breaking for the new John Wayne Birthplace Museum; the festivities included an official proclamation from Iowa Governor Terry Branstad declaring 25 May 2013, as "Maureen O'Hara Day" in Iowa. The appearance included a performance by the [[Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band]], who travelled from Chicago for the event. About Wayne, O'Hara said; "I was tough. I was tall. I was strong. I didn't take any nonsense from anybody. He was tough, he was tall, he was strong and he didn't take any nonsense from anybody. As a man and a human being, I adored him."<ref name=CTtribute>{{cite news|last=Kogan|first=Rick|title=John Wayne celebration a tribute to co-star Maureen O'Hara|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-05-22/entertainment/chi-kogan-john-wayne-20130521_1_john-wayne-birthplace-glenn-frankel-south-side-home|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=22 May 2013}}</ref>

In 2004, she was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Irish Film and Television Academy]] in her native Dublin. The same year, O'Hara released her autobiography ''{{'}}Tis Herself'', co-authored with Johnny Nicoletti and published by [[Simon & Schuster]].

A significant portion of the museum is dedicated to her late husband Charles.

O'Hara donated her late husband's seaplane, the ''Excambian'' (a [[Sikorsky VS-44]]A), to the [[New England Air Museum]]. The restoration of the plane took eight years and time was donated by former pilots and mechanics in honour of Charles Blair. It is the only surviving example of this type of plane.

In 2011, O'Hara was formally inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame at an event in [[New Ross]], [[County Wexford]].<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/0729/maureenohara.html "Maureen O'Hara honoured in New Ross"].

I was to play a young woman named Eiléen O'Shea who helps rescue a little orphan named Molly.

| "My character was the innkeeper's niece, the heroine who is torn between the love of her family and her love for a lawman in disguise." Laughton decided that the actress's name had to be changed since it was 'too long for the marquee' and gave her the choice between O'Mara and O'Hara. Since she rejected both he dismissed her protest and himself decided on O'Hara. O'Hara liked Hitchcock and wrote later that she "never experienced the strange feeling of detachment with Hitchcock that many other actors claimed to have felt while working with him."<ref>'' 'Tis Herself'', p. 30</ref>

I play Claire, the daughter of Athos. [[Cornel Wilde]] was cast as my leading man, (D'Artagnan). I trained rigorously for six weeks with Fred Cavens and his son to perfect my stunt sequences. Fred Cavens was an outstanding Belgian military fencing master and had trained all the great swashbucklers in Hollywood. Physically, I've never worked harder for a role."

| ''[[Kangaroo (1952 film)|Kangaroo]]''
| Dell McGuire
| An Irish immigrant, Michael McGuire ([[Finlay Currie]]), and his daughter Dell (O'Hara) are Australian cattle pastoralists who face poverty and death during the drought of 1900. O'Hara: "The director [[Lewis Milestone]] rewrote Martin Berkeley's story. He destroyed a good, straightforward western. Though I hated every minute of the work, I absolutely loved Australia and the Australian people... most of the film was shot in the desert near [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]]."

| {{sort|Quiet Man|''[[The Quiet Man]]''}}
| Mary Kate Danaher
| O'Hara: "I have often said that ''The Quiet Man'' is my personal favourite of all the pictures I have made. It is the one I am most proud of, and I tend to be very protective of it. I loved Mary Kate Danaher. I loved the hell and fire in her. As I readied to begin playing her, I believed that my most important scene in the picture was when Mary Kate is in the field herding the sheep and Sean Thornton sees her for the very first time. It's a moment captured in time, and it's love at first sight. I felt very strongly that if the audience believed it was love at first sight, then we would have lightning in a bottle. But if they didn't, we would have just another lovely romantic comedy on our hands. The scene comes off beautifully."

| ''[[Against All Flags]]''
| Prudence "Spitfire" Stevens
| With [[Errol Flynn]]. O'Hara: "I respected him professionally and was quite fond of him personally. Of course there was one glaring inconsistency with his professionalism. Errol also drank on the set, something I greatly disliked. You couldn't stop him; Errol did whatever he liked. If the director prohibited alcohol on the set, then Errol would inject oranges with booze and eat them during breaks."

| Karen Harrison
| With [[Anthony Quinn]]. "Critics disliked it, and found it dull."
|-
| ''[[Lady Godiva of Coventry]]''
| [[Lady Godiva]]
| "I was not in the nude, as the studio claimed to the press. I wore a full-length body leotard and underwear that was concealed by my long tresses. An unexpected pleasure on the film was watching a promising young actor named [[Clint Eastwood]] cut his teeth on it."

| "A [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] melodrama, full of mystery, international intrigue, and murder. For the first time in my career I got to play the villain, and [[Bette Davis]] was right – bitches ''are'' fun to play."
|-

| Beatrice Severn
| "When we arrived in [[Havana]] on April 15, 1959, Cuba was a country experiencing revolutionary change. Only four months before , [[Fidel Castro]] and his supporters had toppled [[Fulgencio Batista]]... [[Che Guevara]] was often at the Capri Hotel. Che would talk about Ireland and all the guerilla warfare that had taken place there. He knew every battle in Ireland and all of its history. And I finally asked, "Che, you know so much about Ireland and talk constantly about it. How do you know so much?" He said, "Well, my grandmother's name was Lynch and I learned everything I know about Ireland at her knee." He was Che Guevara Lynch! That famous cap he wore was an Irish rebel's cap. I spent a great deal of time with Che Guevara while I was in Havana. Today he is a symbol for freedom fighters wherever they are in the world and I think he is a good one."<ref>'' 'Tis Herself'' p.254</ref>

| Kit Tilden
| "About a drifter running from his past. [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s feature-film debut... Peckinpah later reached icon status as a great director of westerns, but I thought he was just awful. I found him to be one of the strangest and most objectionable people I had ever worked with."
|-

| Margaret "Maggie" McKendrick
| "''The Parent Trap'' wouldn't have been as special without the remarkable performances by [[Hayley Mills]]. I use the plural here because she really did bring two different girls to life in the movie. Sharon and Susan were so believable that I'd sometimes forget myself and look for the other one when Hayley and I were standing around the set."

| ''[[Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation]]''
| Peggy Hobbs
| O'Hara: "A simple story about a man and his wife who take a family vacation with their children and grandchildren in an old dilapidated house on the beach... I discovered that in a [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]] picture, every scene revolves around Jimmy Stewart. I was never allowed to really play out a single scene in the picture. He was a remarkable actor, but not a generous one."
|-

| ''[[Spencer's Mountain]]''
| Olivia Spencer
| "On location in [[Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming]]. The picture is loosely based on the novel by [[Earl Hamner, Jr.]] about his life growing up in poverty on Spencer's Mountain, under the roof of God-fearing parents. [[Henry Fonda]] told me that he didn't know what he wanted to do with his life until [[Marlon Brando]]'s mother persuaded him to try his hand at acting. Fonda was the gifted, tough, and classy kind of leading man that I most enjoyed working with."
|-
| ''[[McLintock!]]''
| Katherine Gilhooley McLintock
| "There are so many great scenes in the picture. Audiences always rave about the fight sequence that takes place at the mine dump and ends in the mud. A total of forty-two cast members took part in the brawl, and nearly all of us ended up sliding down the bank into the mud pit below. The most dangerous stunt I perform in the picture was the fall from the ladder into the water trough."

It didn't take long for me to see that he was not only a comedic genius but an actor with an extraordinary dramatic talent. He reminded me a great deal of [[Charles Laughton]]."
