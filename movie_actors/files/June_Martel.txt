'''June Martel''' (November 19, 1909 â€“ November 23, 1978) was a singer and a stage and motion picture actress from [[Chicago, Illinois]]. She was a petite brunette who weighed only a bit more than one hundred pounds.

==Singer and actress==
Her career began as a singer in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. Martel was in the cast of the [[Broadway (Manhattan)]] play, ''Snatch as Snatch Can'', in May 1934. Other actors paired with her included [[Barton MacLane]]. Her first film role was in ''[[Front Page Woman]]'' (1935) followed by ''[[Going Highbrow]]'' (1935). The latter starred [[Guy Kibbee]]. She was the female lead in ''Fighting Youth'' (1935). Playing the part of ''Betty Wilson'', Martel starred opposite [[Charles Farrell]] and [[Andy Devine]].  The movie combined football excitement with the influence of [[communism]] on college athletics.

Martel was signed by [[Harry Warner]] of [[Warner Bros.]] in 1935. Other aspiring Warners' actresses were [[Olivia de Havilland]], June Grabiner, Nan Grey, and Dorothy Dare. By August 1936 she had become the property of [[Paramount Pictures]]. The studio cast her as the [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] in ''American Plan''. The story concerned a girl who inherits a newspaper, adapted from an unpublished play by Manny Seff and Milton Lazarus.  She also appeared in ''[[Sitting on the Moon]]'' in 1936.

Martel's final screen roles came in the late 1930s, in [[western films]]. Among these are ''Forlorn River'' (1937), ''Wild Horse Rodeo'' (1937) and ''[[Santa Fe Stampede]]'' (1938).

==Personal life==
She collected odd pieces of jewelry and had amassed a small trunkload of items by 1937. In February 1941 Martel married screenwriter [[Frank Fenton (writer)|Frank Fenton]]. Fenton was also a scenarist and magazine writer. Her first husband was Walter J. Klavun, a [[Yale University]] graduate, whom she divorced in
[[Mexico]] in 1938.

June Martel died in 1978 in [[Los Angeles County, California]].
