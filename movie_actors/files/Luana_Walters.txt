'''Luana Walters''' (July 22, 1912 - May 19, 1963) was a motion picture actress from [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Luana Walters - Overview  | work=[[Allmovie]] | url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/luana-walters-74517 | accessdate=8 September 2009}}</ref>

Walters was an expert horsewoman which led to her discovery as an actress at a [[rodeo]] in [[Palm Springs, California]]. She won a woman's bucking contest which was being watched by a movie scout, who noticed her.

Her film career began when she visited a friend on a [[United Artists]] lot. [[Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.]] was excited about her screen possibilities and arranged for a film test. However, only three days later Fairbanks went to Europe, and the test was never completed.

Not long afterwards [[Joseph Schenck|Joe Schenck]] saw Walters on the dance floor at the Cocoanut Grove in [[Los Angeles, California]]. After viewing the abbreviated test made by Fairbanks, Schenck offered her a contract with United Artists. The studio did not make a movie in the next six months so Walters' option was not taken up.

Walters' screen credits start with an uncredited role in ''[[Reaching for the Moon (1930 film)|Reaching for the Moon]]'' (1930). Her skill as an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] helped her in parts in westerns like ''[[Ride 'Em Cowboy]]'' (1936), ''[[Where the West Begins (1938 film)|Where the West Begins]]'' (1938), ''[[Mexicali Rose]]'' (1939), and ''[[Law of the Wolf]]'' (1939).

On several occasions Walters made films in which her work was left in the cutting room, from the final edit. This began when she made ''[[Reaching for the Moon (1930 film)|Reaching for the Moon]]'' with Fairbanks. Her parts were also deleted from ''[[Spawn of the North]]'' (1938) and ''[[Souls at Sea]]'' (1937). The former was a [[Henry Fonda]] feature and the latter paired Walters with [[Robert Cummings]].

Walters was the first actress to portray [[Superman]]'s biological mother [[Lara (comics)|Lara]] in a live-action format.  She appeared in "Superman Comes to Earth", the first chapter of the 1948 ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' movie serial starring [[Kirk Alyn]] as [[Superman]].  Portions of this depiction appear in flashback in "At the Mercy of Atom Man!", the seventh chapter of the 1950 serial ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]''.

As a fiery and sensual brunette, she worked in a number of [[movie serials]] and [[B-Movie]]s, especially in Westerns, featuring her riding skills, and [[sci-fi]] or horror genres.<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/mobile/celebrity/luana_walters/</ref>

She plays a female reporter on the trail of a fiend's story in ''[[The Corpse Vanishes]]'' (1942), with [[Bela Lugosi]]. She appears as a cellblock guard in ''[[Girls in Prison]]'' (1956). Her final role came in ''[[The She Creature]]'' (1956).<ref>http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/201518%7C101766/Luana-Walters/filmography.html</ref>
