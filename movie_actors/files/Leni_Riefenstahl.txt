'''Helene Bertha Amalie''' "'''Leni'''" '''Riefenstahl''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁiːfənʃtaːl|lang}}; 22 August 1902 – 8 September 2003) was a German film director, producer, screenwriter, editor, photographer, actress and dancer widely known for directing the [[Nazi propaganda]] film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. Riefenstahl’s prominence in the [[Third Reich]], along with her personal association with [[Adolf Hitler]], destroyed her film career following Germany's defeat in [[World War II]], after which she was arrested but released without any charges.<ref name="muller">{{cite video

''Triumph of the Will'' gave Riefenstahl instant and lasting international fame, as well as infamy. She directed eight films, two of which received significant coverage outside Germany. The propaganda value of her films made during the 1930s repels most modern commentators, but many [[History of cinema|film histories]] cite the aesthetics as outstanding.<ref>Koster, Ron, ''[http://www.riefenstahl.org/actress/1925/film-debut.html Leni Riefenstahl’s Film Début]'', 2004, retrieved 6 January 2008</ref><ref>New York Times, Janet Maslin, ''[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E0DC163DF930A25750C0A962958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 Just What Did Leni Riefenstahl’s Lens See?]'', 13 March 1994, retrieved 6 January 2008</ref><ref>Psymon, ''[http://www.psymon.com/art/leni/ Leni Gallery]'', retrieved 6 January 2008</ref><ref name="nysun">{{cite news | url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/leni-riefenstahl-on-trial/49944/ | title=Leni Riefenstahl on Trial | author=Carl Rollyson | publisher=[[The New York Sun]] | date=7 March 2007 | accessdate=2 November 2008}}</ref> ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that ''Triumph of the Will'' "sealed her reputation as the greatest female filmmaker of the 20th century".<ref name="economist">{{cite news |first= |last= |pages=XX |title=Leni Riefenstahl: Hand-held history |date=September 2003 |publisher=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2051630}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Riefenstahl published her still photography of the [[Nuba]] tribes in Sudan in several books such as ''[[The Last of the Nuba]]''. Active until her death at age 101, she published marine life stills and released the marine-based film ''[[Impressionen unter Wasser]]'' in 2002.

After her death, the [[Associated Press]] described Riefenstahl as an "acclaimed pioneer of film and photographic techniques".<ref>Bulldog News, ''[http://www.bulldognews.net/hitlers_filmmaker.html Hitler’s Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl Dead at 101]'' (after Associated Press), 9 September 2003, retrieved 5 January 2008</ref> ''Der Tagesspiegel'' newspaper in Berlin noted, "Leni Riefenstahl conquered new ground in the cinema".<ref>bbc.com, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3097018.stm Leni Riefenstahl the Devil's Diva]'', 10 September 2003, retrieved 5 January 2008</ref> The [[BBC]] said her [[documentaries]] "were hailed as groundbreaking film-making, pioneering techniques involving cranes, tracking rails, and many cameras working at the same time".<ref>bbc.com, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3093154.stm Film-maker Leni Riefenstahl dies]'', 9 September 2003, retrieved 4 January 2008.

==Early life==

Christened Helene Bertha Amalie, and also known as Leni Riefenstahl, she was born into a prosperous [[Germans|German]] [[Protestant]] family on 22 August 1902.<ref>"Leni Riefenstahl" by Leni Riefenstahl; pages: 11, 104</ref> Her affluent father, [[Alfred Riefenstahl]] owned a successful heating and ventilation company and wanted his daughter Leni to follow him into the world of business. Since Leni was the only child he had at that moment, he wanted her to carry on with the family name, and also to secure the abundant money he had made.<ref>[http://courses.washington.edu/ger371/riefenstahl/biography.html]</ref> However, her mother, [[Bertha Scherlach]], who had been a part-time seamstress before her marriage, had faith in Leni and believed that her future was in show business. Leni had a younger brother, Heinz Riefenstahl, who was killed at the Russian front of Hitler’s war against the [[Soviet Union]] when he was 36 years old.

Leni fell in love with the art field. At the age of 4, she began to paint and write poetry. Leni was also athletic, and at the age of twelve she decided to join a "nixe," a gymnastic and swim club. The more she grew, the more her mother perceived her talents in the artistic world. She knew her daughter would grow up to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Leni’s father who was not interested in any artistic motives in his daughter’s life. In 1918, when she was 16, she attended a presentation of "Snow White" which interested her deeply, and she concluded that she wanted to be a dancer. Her father could not agree less with her idea of becoming a dancer. He instead wanted to provide her with an education that could lead to a more dignified profession rather than being a dancer. His wife continued to support her daughter’s passion. They went behind Alfred’s back to enroll Leni in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Riefenstahl gained a reputation on Berlin's dance circuit and became even more popular with time as she traveled. With more dancing, she began getting foot injuries that led to knee surgery, threatening a future dancing career. It was while going to a doctor's appointment that she first saw a poster for [[Mountain of Destiny|Der Berg des Schicksals: Ein Film von Dr. Arnold Fanck]]. This first inspired her to go into movie making. She began visiting the cinema, watching pictures and also attending shows of films.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

On one of her adventures, she met with Luis Trenker who was one of Arnold Fanck’s actors. She was also able to meet with [[Arnold Fanck]] at a meeting arranged by a friend of hers, [[Gunther Rahn]]. Arnold was working on a film in Berlin, where Leni expressed her love and passion for his works, and was able to convince him of her acting skill, and persuaded him to feature her in one of his movies. She later received a package from Dr. Fanck which was a script to Arnold Fanck’s "Der Heilige Berg." That was a dream come true. She made a series of films for Arnold Fanck. He trained her very well and also taught her ways to go about editing a film. One of Arnold's films that brought her outstandingly into the limelight was, ''[[The White Hell of Pitz Palu]]'' (1929), co-directed by [[G. W. Pabst]]. It saw her fame spread to countries outside of Germany. Riefenstahl produced and directed her own work called [[The Blue Light (1932 film)|''Das Blaue Licht'']] (1932), co-written by [[Carl Mayer]] and [[Béla Balázs]]. This film won the Silver Medal at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. In the film, Riefenstahl played an innocent peasant girl who was hated by the villagers because they had the impression that she was diabolic, hence leading to the death of many beings in their village. She was hated and cast away by so many. She always protected a glowing mountain grotto. The film attracted the attention of Hitler, who believed she epitomized the perfect German female. He saw the tremendous talent in her and the great works that she had done, and invited her for a meeting.

==Career==

===Dancer and actress===
Riefenstahl took dancing lessons and attended dance academies from an early age and began her career as a self-styled and well-known [[interpretive dance]]r, traveling around Europe and working with director [[Max Reinhardt]] in a show funded by Jewish producer [[Harry Sokal]].<ref name="guardian2">{{cite news |first= Richard|last= Falcon|pages=XX |title=Leni Riefenstahl |date=9 September 2003 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/sep/09/world.news1 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="new yorker">{{cite news |first= Judith|last= Thurman|pages=XX |title=Where There's a Will |date=17 March 2007 |publisher=[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/03/19/070319crbo_books_thurman?currentPage=3}}</ref> After injuring her knee while performing in [[Prague]], she saw a film about mountains, entitled ''[[Mountain of Destiny]]'' (''der Berg des Schicksals'', 1924), and became fascinated with the possibilities of this sort of film.<ref name="the independent">{{cite news |first= Val|last= Williams|pages=XX |title=Leni Riefenstahl |date=10 September 2003 |publisher=[[The Independent]] |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/leni-riefenstahl-548728.html |location=London}}</ref> She went to the [[Alps]] to meet the film's director, [[Arnold Fanck]], hoping to secure the lead in his next project.<ref name="the independent"/> Instead, Riefenstahl met [[Luis Trenker]] who had starred in Fanck's films, who wrote to the director about her.

Riefenstahl went on to star in many of Fanck’s [[mountain film]]s as an athletic and adventurous young woman with a suggestive appeal; she became an accomplished mountaineer during the winters of filming on mountains and learned filmmaking techniques.<ref name="the independent"/> Riefenstahl went on to have a prolific career as an actress in [[silent film]]s. She was popular with the German public and highly regarded by directors. In 1930, she lost the lead role in the [[Josef von Sternberg]]-directed ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' to her neighbour, [[Marlene Dietrich]].<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news |first= Charles|last= Moore|pages=XX |title=Leni Riefenstahl |date=10 September 2003 |publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]] |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/main.jhtml?xml=/education/2003/09/24/tehAdb1001.xml | location=London}}</ref> Her last acting role before becoming a director was the 1933 U.S.-German co-productions of the Arnold Fanck-directed, German-language ''[[SOS Eisberg]]'' and the [[Tay Garnett]]-directed, [[English language|English-language]] ''SOS Iceberg''. The movies were filmed simultaneously and produced and distributed by [[Universal Studios]]. ''SOS Iceberg'' was Riefenstahl’s only English-language film role as an actress. One of her fans at this time was [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref name="economist"/> Riefenstahl accompanied Fanck to the [[1928 Winter Olympics|1928 Olympic Games]] in [[St. Moritz]], where she became interested in athletic photography and filming.<ref name="the independent"/>

When presented with the opportunity to direct ''[[Das Blaue Licht]]'' ''(The Blue Light)'' (1932), she took it. Breaking from Fanck's style of setting realistic stories in fairytale mountain settings, Riefenstahl—working with leftist screen writers [[Béla Balázs]] and [[Carl Mayer]]—filmed ''Das Blaue Licht'' as a romantic, wholly mystical tale which she thought of as more fitting to the terrain.<ref name="muller" /> She co-wrote, directed and starred in the film and produced it under the banner of her own company, Leni Riefenstahl Productions.<ref name="the independent"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wallace|first1=Peggy A.|title=The Most Important Factor Was the 'Spirit', Leni Riefenstahl During the Filming of THE BLUE LIGHT|journal=Image|date=March 1974|volume=17|issue=1|pages=16–28|url=http://image.eastmanhouse.org/files/GEH_1974_17_01.pdf|accessdate=15 June 2014|publisher=International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House Inc.|location=Rochester, N.Y.}}</ref> ''Das Blaue Licht'' won the Silver Medal at the [[Venice Biennale]] and played to full audiences all over Europe.<ref name="the independent"/> However, it was not universally well-received, for which Riefenstahl blamed the critics, many of them Jewish.<ref name="nytimes3">{{cite news |first= Clive|last= James|pages=XX |title=Reich Star |date=25 March 2007 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/books/review/James.t.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1}}</ref> Upon its 1938 re-release, the names of co-writer [[Béla Balázs]] and producer [[Harry Sokal]], both Jewish, were removed from the credits; some reports claim this was at Riefenstahl’s behest.

===Propaganda films===

Riefenstahl heard candidate Adolf Hitler speak at a rally in 1932 and was mesmerized by his talent as a public speaker. Describing the experience in her memoir, Riefenstahl wrote: "I had an almost apocalyptic vision that I was never able to forget. It seemed as if the Earth's surface were spreading out in front of me, like a hemisphere that suddenly splits apart in the middle, spewing out an enormous jet of water, so powerful that it touched the sky and shook the earth".<ref name="A Memoir 1993">Leni Riefenstahl – A Memoir, St. Martin's Press, 1993, ISBN 0-312-09843-X</ref>

According to the ''Daily Express'' of 24 April 1934, Leni Riefenstahl had read ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' during the making of her film ''The Blue Light''. This newspaper article quotes her as having commented, "The book made a tremendous impression on me. I became a confirmed National Socialist after reading the first page. I felt a man who could write such a book would undoubtedly lead Germany. I felt very happy that such a man had come". She wrote to Hitler requesting a meeting.

After meeting Hitler she was offered the opportunity to direct ''Sieg des Glaubens'' (''[[The Victory of Faith]]''), an hour-long propaganda film about the fifth Nazi Party rally at Nuremberg in 1933. Riefenstahl agreed to direct the movie after returning from filming a movie in Greenland, and it was funded entirely by the [[Nazi Party]] as the credits to the film show quite clearly.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99035, Adolf Hitler und Leni Riefenstahl crop.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Hitler congratulates Riefenstahl in 1934]]

Impressed with Riefenstahl’s work, Hitler asked her to film the upcoming 1934 Party rally in Nuremberg, the sixth such rally. At first, according to Riefenstahl’s memoir, she resisted and did not want to create further Nazi films; instead, she wanted to direct a feature film based on Hitler’s favourite opera, [[Eugen d'Albert]]'s ''[[Tiefland (opera)|Tiefland]]''.<ref name="A Memoir 1993"/> Riefenstahl received private funding for the production of ''Tiefland'', but the filming in Spain was derailed. Hitler was able to convince her to film ''Triumph'' instead, on the condition that she not be required to make further films for the party. She also told Hitler she wanted the freedom to act again: "I would not be able to go on living if I had to give up acting".
The resulting chronicle of the Nuremberg Rally, ''[[Triumph of the Will|Triumph des Willens]]'' (named by Hitler), was generally recognized as an  epic, innovative work of [[propaganda]] filmmaking.<ref>{{cite book|author=International Skiing History Association|title=Skiing Heritage Journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rVgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA36|date=December 2003|publisher=International Skiing History Association|page=36|id={{ISSN|10822895}}}}</ref> ''Triumph of the Will'' became a rousing success in Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Hear|first=Anthony|title=Philosophy, the Good, the True and the Beautiful|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ybp9MDhOD9kC&pg=PA251|date=25 September 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78511-2|page=251}}</ref> It made Riefenstahl the first female film director to achieve international recognition.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In interviews for the 1993 film ''[[The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl]]'', Riefenstahl adamantly denied any deliberate attempt to create pro-Nazi propaganda and said she was disgusted that ''Triumph of the Will'' was used in such a way.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0312-503, Nürnberg, Reichsparteitag, Marsch der Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|250px|Soldiers march past a saluting Hitler in Riefenstahl’s film of the 1934 Nazi party rally in Nuremberg]]

Despite vowing not to make any more films about the Nazi Party, in 1935, Riefenstahl made the 18-minute ''Day of Freedom: Armed Forces'' about the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. Like ''Victory of Faith'' and ''Triumph of the Will'' this was filmed at the annual Nazi Party rally at Nuremberg. Riefenstahl never denied making this short 18 minute film. However she always claimed this film was a sub-set of ''Triumph of the Will'' added to mollify the German army which felt it was not represented well in the 1934 filming of ''Triumph of the Will''. Over a million Germans had participated in the 1934 rally in Nuremberg. Later, yearly rallies held in Nuremberg got even bigger. The 1935 rally is noted for pronouncements about the status of Jews in Germany. These became known as the [[Nuremberg Laws]] which for Jews in Europe would soon become matters of life and death.

In 1936, Hitler invited Riefenstahl to film the [[Olympic Games]] in Berlin, a film which Riefenstahl claimed had been commissioned by the International Olympic Committee. She also went to Greece to take footage of the games' original site at Olympia, where she was aided by Greek photographer [[Nelly's|Nelly]], along with route of the [[1936 Summer Olympics torch relay|inaugural torch relay]]. This material became ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', a successful film which has since been widely noted for its technical and aesthetic achievements. She was one of the first filmmakers to use tracking shots in a documentary, placing a camera on rails to follow the athletes' movement, and she is noted for the slow motion shots included in the film. Riefenstahl’s work on ''Olympia'' has been cited as a major influence in modern sports photography. Riefenstahl filmed competitors of all races, including African-American [[Jesse Owens]] in what would later become famous footage.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S34639, Joseph Goebbels und Leni Riefenstahl crop.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Riefenstahl with [[Joseph Goebbels]] (1937)]]

''Olympia'' was very successful in Germany after it premiered for Hitler’s 49th birthday in 1938, and its international debut led Riefenstahl to embark on an American publicity tour in an attempt to secure commercial release. In 1937, Riefenstahl told a reporter for the ''Detroit News'': "To me, Hitler is the greatest man who ever lived. He truly is without fault, so simple and at the same time possessed of masculine strength". She arrived in New York City in November 1938, five days before [[Kristallnacht]], or 'night of broken glass'; when news of the event reached the U.S., Riefenstahl maintained that Hitler was innocent. On 18 November, she was received by [[Henry Ford]] in Detroit and ''Olympia'' was shown at "The Chicago Engineers Club" two days later. [[Avery Brundage]] stated that it was "The greatest Olympic film ever made" and Riefenstahl left for Hollywood, where she was received by the German Consul [[Georg Gyssling]], on 24 November. She negotiated with [[Louis B. Mayer]] and on 8 December, [[Walt Disney]] brought her on a three-hour tour showing her the ongoing production of ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref>"Olympia in America, 1938: Leni Riefenstahl, Hollywood, and the Kristallnacht" by Cooper C. Graham (LOC), Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, Vol. 13, No. 4,1993</ref>

After the ''[[Goebbels Diaries]]'' surfaced, researchers learned that Riefenstahl had been friendly with [[Joseph Goebbels]] and his wife, [[Magda Goebbels|Magda]], attending the opera with them and coming to the Goebbels' parties.<ref name="nysun"/> However, Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset that she had rejected his advances<ref name="nytimes3"/> and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat; therefore, his diaries could not be trusted. By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl’s filmmaking but was angered with what he saw as her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.<ref name="nytimes3"/>

On 14 June 1940, the day Paris was declared an [[open city]] by the French and occupied by German troops, Riefenstahl wrote to Hitler in a [[telegram]], "With indescribable joy, deeply moved and filled with burning gratitude, we share with you, my Führer, your and Germany's greatest victory, the entry of German troops into Paris. You exceed anything human imagination has the power to conceive, achieving deeds without parallel in the history of mankind.

After the Nuremberg rallies trilogy and ''Olympia'', Riefenstahl began work on the movie she had tried and failed to direct once before, ''[[Tiefland (film)|Tiefland]]''. On Hitler’s direct order the German government paid her 7 million reichsmarks in compensation.<ref>Jürgen Trimborn : Riefenstahl, Berlin 2002, page. 325</ref> From 23 September until 13 November 1940 she filmed in [[Krün]] near [[Mittenwald]]. The extras playing Spanish women and farmers were drawn from gypsies ([[Sinti]]) detained in a camp at [[Salzburg]]-Maxglan who were forced to work with her. Filming at the [[Babelsberg Studios]] near Berlin began 18 months later in April 1942 and lasted into summer. This time [[Sinti]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] from the [[Marzahn]] detention camp near Berlin were compelled to work as extras.<ref>Kein Vergessen, 70.

This issue came up again in 2002, when Riefenstahl was one hundred years old and she was taken to court by a [[Romani people|Roma]] group for denying the Nazis had exterminated gypsies. Riefenstahl apologized, saying, "I regret that Sinti and Roma had to suffer during the period of National Socialism. It is known today that many of them were murdered in concentration camps".

The last time Riefenstahl saw Hitler was when she married Peter Jacob on 21 March 1944, shortly after she had introduced Jacob to Hitler in [[Kitzbühel, Austria]].<ref name="nytimes4"/> Riefenstahl and Jacob divorced in 1946;<ref name="the independent"/> Jacob became involved with [[Henriette von Schirach]].

In October 1944 the production of ''Tiefland'' moved to [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague for interior filming. Lavish sets made these shots some of the most costly in the film but they were finished within days. The film was not edited and released until almost 10 years later.

As Germany’s military collapsed in the spring of 1945 Riefenstahl left Berlin<ref name="the independent"/> and was [[hitchhiking]] with a group of men, trying to reach her mother, when she was taken into custody by American troops. She walked out of a holding camp, beginning a series of escapes and arrests across the chaotic landscape. At last making it back home on a bicycle, she found that American troops had seized her house, then was surprised by how kindly they treated her.<ref name="washington">courses.washington.edu, ''[http://courses.washington.edu/ger371/riefenstahl/biography.html Leni Riefenstahl – biography]'', retrieved 11 September 2008</ref>

==Post-war life and career==

=== Detention and trials ===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2014}}
Writer [[Budd Schulberg]], assigned by the US Navy to the OSS for intelligence work while attached to John Ford’s documentary unit, was ordered to arrest Riefenstahl at her chalet in Kitzbühel, Austria, ostensibly to have her identify the faces of Nazi war criminals in German film footage captured by the Allied troops. Riefenstahl claimed she was not aware of the nature of the internment camps. According to Schulberg, "She gave me the usual song and dance. She said, ‘Of course, you know, I'm really so misunderstood. I'm not political.’" However, when Riefenstahl later claimed she had been forced to follow Goebbels’ orders under threat of being sent to a concentration camp, Schulberg asked her why she should have been afraid if she did not know concentration camps existed. When shown photographs of the camps, Riefenstahl reportedly reacted with horror and tears.

Riefenstahl continued to maintain she was fascinated by the National Socialists but politically naïve and ignorant about any war crimes. From 1945 through 1948 she was held in sundry American and French-run detention camps and prisons along with house arrest but although Riefenstahl was tried four times by various postwar authorities, she was never convicted through [[denazification]] trials either for her alleged role as a propagandist or for the use of concentration camp inmates in her films. However, she was found to be a [[fellow traveler]] who was sympathetic to the Nazis.

Riefenstahl later said that her biggest regret was meeting Hitler: "It was the biggest catastrophe of my life. Until the day I die people will keep saying, ‘Leni is a Nazi’, and I’ll keep saying, ‘But what did she do?’" Although she won more than 50 libel cases against people accusing her of collaborating with the Nazis, there are many unanswered questions{{specify|date=March 2013}} about her relation to National Socialism in particular and fascism more generally.

=== Thwarted film projects ===
Most of the negatives for Riefenstahl’s finished films and other production materials relating to her unfinished projects were lost towards the end of the war. The French government confiscated all of her editing equipment, along with the production reels of ''[[Tiefland (film)|Tiefland]]''. After years of legal wrangling these were returned to her, but the French government had reportedly damaged some of the film stock whilst trying to develop and edit it and a few key scenes were missing (although Riefenstahl was surprised to find the original negatives for ''Olympia'' in the same shipment). She edited and dubbed what elements were left and ''Tiefland'' premiered on 11 February 1954 in [[Stuttgart]], however, it was denied entry into the [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="washington"/> Although Riefenstahl lived for almost another half century, ''Tiefland'' was her last feature film.<ref>news.bbc.co.uk, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/shropshire/4096400.stm Nazi propaganda photos withdrawn]'', 15 June 2005, retrieved 11 September 2008</ref>

Riefenstahl tried many times (15 by her count)<ref name="the independent"/> to make films during the 1950s and 1960s but was met with resistance, public protests and sharp criticism. Many of her filmmaking peers in Hollywood had fled Nazi Germany and were unsympathetic to her.<ref name="the independent"/> Although both film professionals and investors were willing to support her work, most of the projects she attempted were stopped owing to ever-renewed and highly negative publicity about her past work for the Third Reich.<ref name="washington"/> In 1956, inspired by [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s 1935 novel ''[[Green Hills of Africa]]'', she began an ambitious film project in Africa drawn from another novel called ''Schwarze Fracht'' (''Black Freight'').<ref name="telegraph"/> While scouting shooting locations, she almost died from injuries received in a truck accident. After waking up from a coma in a [[Nairobi]] hospital, she finished writing the script there, but was soon thoroughly thwarted by uncooperative locals, the [[Suez Crisis|Suez Canal crisis]], and bad weather (only test shots were ever made).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In 1954, [[Jean Cocteau]] insisted on ''Tiefland'' being shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], which he was running that year.<ref name="guardian2"/> Cocteau greatly admired the film.<ref name="nybooks">{{cite news |first= Ian|last= Baruma|pages=XX |title=Fascinating Narcissism |date=14 June 2007 |publisher=[[New York Review of Books]] |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20258}}</ref> In 1960, Riefenstahl unsuccessfully attempted to prevent filmmaker [[Erwin Leiser]] from juxtaposing scenes from ''Triumph of the Will'' with footage from concentration camps in his film ''Mein Kampf''.<ref name="the independent"/> Riefenstahl had high hopes for a collaboration with Cocteau called ''Friedrich und Voltaire'', wherein Cocteau was to play two roles. They thought the film might symbolize the "love-hate relationship" between Germany and France. Cocteau's illness and 1963 death put an end to this project.<ref name="washington"/> A musical remake of ''The Blue Light'' with [[L.

=== Photography and final film ===
In the 1960s, Riefenstahl became interested in Africa from Hemingway's book and from the photographs of [[George Rodger]].<ref name="nybooks"/> Rodger, who had taken the first photographs of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], refused to help Riefenstahl meet Africans, citing their respective backgrounds.<ref name="nybooks"/> Riefenstahl took up photography, documenting a diverse array of subjects.

In her later years, Riefenstahl became known for her longevity and physical stamina, although she often suffered considerable pain from old injuries. At age 72, Riefenstahl began pursuing [[underwater photography]] after lying about her age to gain certification for [[scuba diving]] (she cut 20 years off her age). In 1978, she published a book of her sub-aquatic photographs, ''[[Korallengärten]]'' ''(Coral Gardens)'' followed by the 1990 book; ''[[Wunder unter Wasser]]'' ''(Wonder under Water)''.<ref name="the independent"/> On 22 August 2002, her 100th birthday, Riefenstahl released a film called ''[[Impressionen unter Wasser]]'' (''Underwater Impressions''), an idealized documentary of life in the oceans and her first film in over 25 years.<ref name="guardian"/> At age 100, she was still photographing marine life and gained the distinction of being the world's oldest scuba diver.<ref name="nybooks"/> Riefenstahl was a member of [[Greenpeace]] for 8 years.<ref>Harper's Index.

=== Death ===
[[File:WP Leni Riefenstahl Grabstelle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Riefenstahl's grave in Munich Waldfriedhof cemetery]]
Riefenstahl celebrated her 101st birthday on 22 August 2003 at the extravagant hotel in Feldafing, nearby her home at Lake Starnberg in the Bavarian province of Germany, with a guest list that consisted of over 200 people, including Germany's most prominent socialites and celebrities such as [[Siegfried and Roy]]. However, the following day after her birthday celebration, she became ill.

According to her assistant Horst Kettner, who was her domestic partner for 38 years, “Ms. Riefenstahl is in great pain and she has become very weak and is taking painkillers.” In fact, she had been suffering with cancer for some time, and her health had been deteriorating for weeks. Leni Riefenstahl died in her sleep on 8 September 2003 at her home in Pöcking, Germany.  She was buried in [[Munich Waldfriedhof]] cemetery.

There was varied response in the obituary pages of leading publications, although most recognized her technical breakthroughs in film making:

The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote: {{quote|She was perhaps the most talented female cinema director of the 20th century; her celebration of Nazi Germany in film ensured that she was certainly the most infamous. ... Critics would later decry her fascination with the athletes’ [Olympia] physiques as fascistic; but in truth her interest was born not of racist ends but of the delight she, as a former dancer, took in the human form.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1440991/Leni-Riefenstahl.html?pageNum=3 Leni Riefenstahl (obituary)] [[Daily Telegraph]]. 9 September 2003</ref>}}
''[[The Independent]]'' wrote:
{{quote|Opinions will be divided between those who see her as a young, talented and ambitious woman caught up in the tide of events which she did not fully understand, and those who believe her to be a cold and opportunist propagandist and a Nazi by association.<ref name="the independent"/>}}
''The Independent'' also offered:
{{quote|At the end of her long life she was still the controversial femme fatale of German films...She was interested in beauty, adventure and films, but she was famous for being the woman you love to hate.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/sep/11/news.sandrasmith What they said about......Leni Riefenstahl] The Guardian. 11 September 2003</ref>}} <!-- Claudia Lenssen in ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'' -->

== Views of critics ==
In his book ''The Story of Film'', film scholar Mark Cousins claims, "Next to [[Orson Welles]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Leni Riefenstahl was the most technically talented Western film maker of her era".

Reviewer Gary Morris called Riefenstahl "an artist of unparalleled gifts, a woman in an industry dominated by men, one of the great formalists of the cinema on a par with [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] or [[Orson Welles|Welles]]".<ref>Bright Lights Film Journal, ''[http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/26/riefenstahl.html Lonesome Leni]'' (film review), November 1999, retrieved 4 January 2008</ref> [[Pauline Kael]] called ''Triumph'' and ''Olympia'' "the two greatest films ever directed by a woman".<ref name="time3"/>

''[[New York Times]]'' film critic Hal Erickson states that while the ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''’s "Jewish Question" is mainly unmentioned, "filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl prefers to concentrate on cheering crowds, precision marching, military bands, and Hitler’s climactic speech, all orchestrated, choreographed and illuminated on a scale that makes Griffith and DeMille look like poverty-row directors."<ref name=EricksonWill>Erickson, Hal. Rev. of ''Triumph of the Will'', dir. Leni Riefenstahl. ''New York Times''. Web</ref> The recurring topic of a female director with such prowess and force executing such a work was apparently resented by propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] "but finally had to admit that her images, achieved through the use of 30 cameras and 120 assistants, were worth a thousand speeches."<ref name=EricksonWill /> While it may be "possibly the most powerful propaganda film ever made, ''Triumph of the Will'' is also, in retrospect, one of the most horrifying."<ref name=EricksonWill />

''New York Times'' film critic Hal Erickson says of Riefenstahl, “Having proven her mettle with her still-astonishing propaganda epic ''Triumph of the Will'', [[Germans|German]] filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl furthered her reputation with the two-part ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]''.”<ref name=EricksonOlympia>Erickson, Hal. Rev. of ''Olympia'', dir. Leni Riefenstahl. ''New York Times''. Web.</ref> While the first half of the film is unique in its portrayal of “non-true Aryan” athletes, especially the emerging star of [[Jesse Owens]], “The second half of the film is the more impressive technically, with Riefenstahl utilizing an astonishing variety of camera speeds and angles to record the diving competition.”<ref name=EricksonOlympia /> Showing Riefenstahl’s work ethic and perseverance, her crew began “Working 16 hours a day, seven days a week.” <ref name=EricksonOlympia /> Though, “Riefenstahl and her staff were often denied desirable camera angles,” they were forced “to improvise with telephoto lenses.” <ref name=EricksonOlympia /> The results of this ingenuity are “far more dramatically impressive than the up-close-and-personal approach taken by contemporary TV cameramen.”<ref name=EricksonOlympia />

Critic Judith Thurman says in her piece in the ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that “Riefenstahl’s “genius” has rarely been questioned, even by critics who despise the service to which she lent it.” Riefenstahl was a “consummate stylist obsessed with bodies in motion, particularly those of dancers and athletes.”<ref name=ThurmanJudith>Thurman, Judith. “Where There’s A Will.” ''The New Yorker'' 19 March 2007. Print.</ref> Her two most famous films, ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'' and ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' are critiqued by Thurman, who says, “In both, Riefenstahl relies heavily for her transitions on portentous cutaways to clouds, mist, statuary, foliage, and rooftops. Her reaction shots have a tedious sameness: shining, ecstatic faces—nearly all young and Aryan, except for [[Hitler]]’s.”<ref name=ThurmanJudith /> Thurman claims that very few people actually see Riefenstahl’s full work, saying “many people, even film buffs, seem never to have seen — or are unaware of never having seen — Riefenstahl’s documentaries in their entirety,” which leads people to believe that “If, by definition, the trailer for a so-called masterpiece can never be greater than the film itself, then Riefenstahl’s legacy fails the test.”<ref name=ThurmanJudith />

Writer Richard Corliss wrote in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine that he was "impressed by Riefenstahl’s standing as a total auteur: producer, writer, director, editor and, in the fiction films, actress."<ref name=CorlissRichard>Corliss, Richard. "That Old Feeling: Leni's Triumph." ''Time'' 22 August 2002. Print.</ref> On the subject of her films being classic works, and not simply propaganda, Corliss argues that "The issues her films and her career raise are as complex and they are important, and her vilifiers tend to reduce the argument to one of a director's complicity in atrocity or her criminal ignorance."<ref name=CorlissRichard /> The reason, Corliss states, that people discredit her work, and continue to do so, is the fact that she is a woman, saying, "Riefenstahl’s sin, I suspect, was being a woman — a woman who, uniquely, dared to play the man's game of filmmaking. Play and win, for, by any disinterested standard, ''Triumph of the Will'' and ''Olympia'' are towering artistic achievements."<ref name=CorlissRichard /> Even though "she shot her last feature film, ''[[Tiefland (film)|Tiefland]]'', in the early 40s, and released it in 1954, Riefenstahl is still the world's most controversial director; her name summons the conflicts of defiant artistry and compromised morality."<ref name=CorlissRichard /> But regardless of political opinion "Riefenstahl’s visual style — heroic, sensuous, attuned to the mists and myths of nature" will always be celebrated, though at the time it was not in "critical fashion." <ref name=CorlissRichard /> "Finally, Riefenstahl was a woman, a beautiful woman. When she was seen with Hitler, their photos made the world's front pages. And the image stuck."<ref name=CorlissRichard />
In 2008, Yukihiko Yoshida did a study called <ref>Yoshida,Yukihiko, Leni Riefenstahl and German Expressionism: A Study of Visual Cultural Studies Using Transdisciplinary Semantic Space of Specialized Dictionaries ,Technoetic Arts: a journal of speculative research (Editor Roy Ascott),Volume 8, Issue3,intellect,2008</ref> "Leni Riefenstahl and German expressionism: research in Visual Cultural Studies using the trans-disciplinary semantic spaces of specialized dictionaries."  The study took databases of images tagged with connotative and denotative keywords (a search engine) and found Riefenstahl’s imagery had the same qualities as imagery tagged "degenerate" in the title of the exhibition, "Degenerate Art" in Germany at 1937.

In 1993, she was the subject of the [[Emmy Award]]-winning German documentary film ''[[The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl]]'', directed by Ray Müller.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000353/1993 International Emmy Awards.] 1993.

Leni was motivated by her old age and for some time was working on her memoirs, decided to commission this documentary to tell her life story about the struggles she had gone through in her personal life, her film-making career, and what people thought of her. In the documentary Leni Riefenstahl said that her biggest mistake was meeting Hitler: "It was the biggest catastrophe of my life. Until the day I die people will keep saying, 'Leni is a Nazi'." At one point Muller asked a specific question to Leni about what her films were meant to be and not what most people thought they were and she insisted that her films were never meant to advance the political program of National Socialism, that she looked at the world with the pure, disinterested eye of an artist, and cared only about the noble task of giving vivid cinematic form to contemporary events. She was also the subject of Müller's 2000 documentary film ''[[Leni Riefenstahl: Her Dream of Africa]]'', documenting her return to [[Sudan]] to visit the [[Nuba]].

== In popular culture ==
Riefenstahl’s filming merits are discussed between characters in the Quentin Tarantino film ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]''. Tarantino explained the significant presence of Third Reich film-making in his film: "Riefenstahl and Goebbels despised each other. He was in charge of every single person in the German film industry with the sole exception of her".<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/16/entertainment/ca-guide16?pg=3 Quentin Tarantino's 'Basterds' is a glorious mash-up] LA Times. 16 August 2009</ref>
