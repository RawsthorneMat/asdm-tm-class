'''Clarence Leroy "Lee" Van Cleef, Jr.''' (January 9, 1925 – December 16, 1989), was an American film actor who appeared mostly in [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and action pictures. His sharp features and piercing eyes led to his being cast as a villain in scores of films, such as ''[[Kansas City Confidential]]'', ''[[High Noon]]'', ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'', and ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]''. 

==Youth==
{{unsourced|section|date=April 2015}}
Van Cleef was born on January 9, 1925 in [[Somerville, New Jersey]], the son of Marion Levinia (née Van Fleet) and Clarence LeRoy Van Cleef. At the age of 17, he obtained his high school diploma early in his senior year in order to enlist in the United States Navy in September, 1942. After basic training and further training at the Naval Fleet Sound School, he was assigned to a [[submarine chaser]] and then to a [[minesweeper]], {{USS|Incredible|AM-249|6}}, on which he worked as sonarman.

The ship initially patrolled the Caribbean, then moved to the Mediterranean, participating in the [[Operation Dragoon|landings in southern France]]. In January 1945 ''Incredible'' moved to the [[Black Sea]], and performed sweeping duties out of the Soviet Navy base at [[Sevastopol]], [[Crimea]]. Afterwards the ship performed air-sea rescue patrols in the Black Sea, before returning to [[Palermo, Sicily]]. By the time of his discharge in March 1946, he had achieved the rank of [[Sonar technician|Sonarman First Class]] (SO1), and earned his Mine Sweeper Patch. He had been awarded the [[Bronze Star]] and the [[Good Conduct Medal (United States)|Good Conduct Medal]]. By virtue of his deployments Van Cleef also qualified for the [[European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]], [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] and [[American Campaign Medal]] and the [[World War II Victory Medal]].{{cn|date=April 2015}}

==Career==
After leaving the Navy, Van Cleef read for a part in ''[[Our Town]]'' at the Little Theater Group in [[Clinton, New Jersey]].. He got the part.{{Which|date=April 2015}} From there, he continued to meet with the group and audition for parts. The next biggest part was that of the boxer, Joe Pendleton, in the play ''Heaven Can Wait''. During this time he was observed by visiting talent scouts who were impressed by Van Cleef's stage presence and delivery. One of these scouts later took him to New York City talent agent Maynard Morris of the [[MCA Inc.|MCA]] agency who then sent him to the Alvin Theater for an audition. The play was ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]''.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

During a performance of ''Mister Roberts'' in Los Angeles, he was noticed by film director [[Stanley Kramer]] who offered Van Cleef a role in his upcoming film ''[[High Noon]]''. Kramer originally wanted Van Cleef for the role of the deputy Harvey Pell, but as he wanted Van Cleef to have his "distinctive nose" fixed, Van Cleef declined the role in favor of the part of the silent gunslinger Jack Colby. He was then cast mostly in villainous roles, due to his sharp cheeks and chin, piercing eyes and hawk-like nose,{{cn|date=April 2015}} from the part of Tony Romano in ''[[Kansas City Confidential]]'' (1952), and culminating 14 years later in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966).<ref name="imdb"/> 

Aside from [[Western (genre)|westerns]] and the science fiction films, three of his early major roles were in noir films, ''[[Kansas City Confidential]]'' (1952), ''[[Vice Squad (1953 film)|Vice Squad]]'' (1953) and ''[[The Big Combo]]'' (1955). Van Cleef appeared six times between 1951 and 1955 on the children's [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] western series, ''[[The Adventures of Kit Carson]]'', starring [[Bill Williams (actor)|Bill Williams]].<ref name="imdb"/> He was cast three times, including the role of Rocky Hatch in the episode "Greed Rides the Range" (1952), of another syndicated western series, ''[[The Range Rider]]''. In 1952, he was cast in the episode "Formula for Fear" of the western aviation series ''[[Sky King]]''. He appeared in episode 82 of the TV series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'' in 1952. In 1954, Van Cleef appeared as [[Jesse James]] in the syndicated series, ''[[Stories of the Century]]''.<ref name="imdb"/>

In 1955, he was cast twice on another syndicated western series, ''[[Annie Oakley (TV series)|Annie Oakley]]''. That same year, he guest-starred on the [[CBS]] western series, ''[[Brave Eagle]]''. In 1955, he played one of the two villains in an episode of ''[[The Adventures of Champion]]'' the Wonder Horse. In 1958, he was cast as Ed Murdock, a rodeo performer trying to reclaim the title in the event as [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]], on ''[[Richard Diamond, Private Detective]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0686454|title="Rodeo", ''Richard Diamond, Private Detective'', February 20, 1958|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}</ref>

Van Cleef played different minor characters on four episodes of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Rifleman]]'', with [[Chuck Connors]], between 1959 and 1962, and twice on ABC's ''[[Tombstone Territory]]''. In 1958, he was cast as Deputy Sid Carver in the episode "The Great Stagecoach Robbery" of another syndicated western series, ''[[Frontier Doctor]]'', starring [[Rex Allen]]. Van Cleef appeared in 1959 as Luke Clagg in the episode "Strange Request" of the NBC western series ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]''.

Van Cleef played a sentry on an episode of the ABC sitcom ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', with [[Walter Brennan]]. Van Cleef was cast with [[Pippa Scott]] and again with Chuck Connors in the 1960 episode "Trial by Fear" of the CBS [[anthology series]] ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]''. A young Van Cleef also made an appearance as Frank Diamond in ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', in an episode entitled "The Unhired Assassin." He also appeared in an episode of the ABC/[[Warner Brothers]] western series ''[[The Alaskans]]''.<ref name="imdb"/>

Van Cleef guest-starred on the CBS western series ''[[Have Gun - Will Travel]]'', on the ABC/WB series ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]'', on the [[NBC]] western series ''[[Cimarron City (TV series)|Cimarron City]]'' and ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'', and on [[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[crime drama]]s ''[[City Detective (TV series)|City Detective]]'' and ''[[State Trooper (TV series)|State Trooper]]''. He guest-starred in an episode of [[John Bromfield]]'s syndicated crime drama, ''[[Sheriff of Cochise]]''. Van Cleef starred as minor villains and henchmen in various westerns, including ''[[The Tin Star]]'' and ''[[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (film)|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]''.<ref name="imdb">{{IMDb name|1812}}</ref>

In 1958, a severe car crash nearly cost Van Cleef his life and career. A resulting knee injury made his physicians think that he would never ride a horse again. This injury plagued Van Cleef for the rest of his life and caused him great pain. His recovery was long and arduous and halted his acting for a time. He then began a business in interior decoration with second wife Joan, as well as pursuing his talent for painting, primarily of sea and landscapes.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

In 1960, he appeared as a villainous swindler in the ''[[Bonanza]]'' episode, "The Bloodline" (December 31, 1960) and also made an appearance on ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.In 1961 he played a role on episode 7 ("The Grave") of the 3rd season of "The Twilight zone". He played a villainous henchman in the 1962 [[John Ford]] movie ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]''. . In 1963, he appeared on ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' (episode: "The Case of the Golden Oranges"). That same year he appeared in "The Day of the Misfits" on ''[[The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (TV series)|The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters]]''. In 1965, his career revived when [[Sergio Leone]] cast Van Cleef, whose career was still in the doldrums, as one of the two protagonists, alongside [[Clint Eastwood]], in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''.<ref name="imdb"/>

Leone then chose Van Cleef to appear again with Eastwood, this time as the primary villain Angel Eyes in the now seminal western ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966). With his roles in Leone's films, Van Cleef became a major star of [[Spaghetti Westerns]], playing central, and often surprisingly heroic, roles in films such as ''[[Death Rides a Horse]]'', ''[[Day of Anger]]'', ''[[The Big Gundown]]'', ''[[The Sabata Trilogy]]'', and ''[[The Grand Duel]]''.  Van Cleef also had a supporting role in [[John Carpenter]]'s [[cult film]] ''[[Escape from New York]]''. In 1984, Van Cleef was cast as a ninja master in the NBC adventure series ''[[The Master (TV series)|The Master]]'', but it was canceled after thirteen episodes. All in all, he is credited with 90 movie roles and 109 other television appearances over a 38-year span.<ref name="imdb"/>

==Personal life==
Van Cleef was married three times. He and his first wife, Patsy Ruth, were married from 1943 until their divorce in 1960. Later that year, he married his second wife, Joan Drane. He and Drane divorced in 1974. Two years later, he married his third wife, Barbara Havelone, to whom he remained married until his death in 1989. He had four children.<ref name="imdb"/>

Despite suffering from heart disease from the late 1970s and having a pacemaker installed in the early 1980s, Van Cleef continued to work in films until his death on December 16, 1989, at the age of 64. He collapsed in his home in [[Oxnard, California]], from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. [[Throat cancer]] was listed as a secondary cause of death.<ref>{{cite web|last=Magers|first=Boyd|title=Lee Van Cleef|url=http://www.westernclippings.com/heavies/leevancleef_charactersheavies.shtml|publisher=Western Clippings|accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> Van Cleef is interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Hollywood Hills, California]].
