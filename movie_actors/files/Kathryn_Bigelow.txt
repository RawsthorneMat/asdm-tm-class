==Early life and education==

Bigelow was born in [[San Carlos, California]], the only child of Gertrude Kathryn (née Larson; 1917–1994), a librarian, and Ronald Elliot Bigelow (1915–1992), a paint factory manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800091098/bio|publisher=yahoo.com|title=Kathryn Bigelow Biography|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref> Her mother was of Norwegian descent.<ref>http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/movies/articles/2009/07/08/20090708hurtlocker0708.html?nclick_check=1</ref> Bigelow's early creative endeavors were as a student of painting.  She enrolled at [[San Francisco Art Institute]] in the fall of 1970 and received her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in December 1972.  While enrolled at [[SFAI]], she was accepted into the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]'s Independent Study Program in New York City.<ref name="newsweek"/> Bigelow's early work benefited from her apprenticeships with [[Vito Acconci]], [[Richard Serra]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]].<ref name=Benson01/> Also in her early days in Manhattan, Bigelow teamed up with [[Philip Glass]] on a real-estate venture in which the pair personally renovated distressed apartments downtown then sold them for a profit.<ref name=Filkins />

Bigelow entered the graduate film program at [[Columbia University]], where she studied theory and criticism and earned her master's degree. Her professors included [[Vito Acconci]], [[Sylvère Lotringer]] and [[Susan Sontag]],<ref name=nyt>[[Manohla Dargis|Dargis, Manohla]], [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/movies/21darg.html "Action!"], ''New York Times'', June 18, 2009.

==Directing career==

{{rquote|right|If there's specific resistance to women making movies, I just choose to ignore that as an obstacle for two reasons: I can't change my gender, and I refuse to stop making movies. It's irrelevant who or what directed a movie, the important thing is that you either respond to it or you don't. There should be more women directing; I think there's just not the awareness that it's really possible. It is. |Kathryn Bigelow in 1990<ref>Perry, Michelle P., [http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N13/int.13a.html "Kathryn Bigelow discusses role of 'seductive violence' in her films"], ''The Tech'' ([[MIT]]), March 16, 1990. An interview with the star ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]) and writer-director (Bigelow) of ''Blue Steel''.</ref>}}

Bigelow's short "The Set-Up," is a 20-minute deconstruction of violence in film. The film portrays "two men fighting each other as the [[semiotics|semioticians]] [[Sylvère Lotringer]] and Marshall Blonsky [[deconstruction|deconstruct]] the images in voice-over."<ref name=nyt/> Bigelow asked her actors to actually beat and bludgeon each other throughout the film's all-night shoot.<ref name=Benson01/> Her first full-length feature was ''[[The Loveless]]'' (1982), a biker film which she co-directed with Monty Montgomery and featured [[Willem Dafoe]] in his first starring role. Next, she directed ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987), which she co-scripted with [[Eric Red]]. In the same year, she directed a music video for the [[New Order]] song "[[Touched by the Hand of God]]"; the video is a spoof of [[glam metal]] imagery.

Bigelow's subsequent trilogy of action films — ''Blue Steel'', ''Point Break'', and ''Strange Days'' — merged her philosophically minded manipulation of pace with the market demands of mainstream film-making. In the process, Bigelow became recognizable as both a Hollywood brand and an auteur. All three films rethink the conventions of action cinema while exploring gendered and racial politics.<ref name=Benson01/>

[[File:Kathryn Bigelow by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bigelow at the 2010 [[Time 100]] Gala]]
Eric Red was also co-writer on Bigelow's 1990 film, ''[[Blue Steel (1990 film)|Blue Steel]].''  ''Blue Steel'' starred [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as a rookie police officer who is stalked by a psychopathic killer, played by [[Ron Silver]].

Bigelow followed ''Blue Steel'' with ''[[Point Break]]'' (1991), which starred [[Keanu Reeves]] as an FBI agent who poses as a surfer to catch the "Ex-Presidents", a team of surfing armed robbers led by [[Patrick Swayze]] who wear Reagan, Nixon, LBJ and Jimmy Carter masks when they hold up banks. ''Point Break'' (1991) was Kathryn Bigelow's most profitable 'studio' film, taking approximately $80 million at the global box-office during the year of its release, and yet it remains one of her least well-received films, both in terms of commercial reviews and academic analysis. This is perhaps due to the fact that it most successfully conforms to its action genre and abandons much of the stylistic substance and subtext of Bigelow's other work.<ref>Jermyn, Deborah, and Sean Redmond. "Chapter Six – All That Is Male Melts into Air: Bigelow on the Edge of Point Break." The Cinema of Kathryn Bigelow: Hollywood Transgressor. London: Wallflower, 2003. 106–7. Print.</ref>

In 1993, she directed an episode of the TV series ''[[Wild Palms]]''.

{{rquote|right|I've spent a fair amount of time thinking about what my aptitude is, and I really think it's to explore and push the medium.  It's not about breaking gender roles or genre traditions.|Kathryn Bigelow in 2009<ref name="newsweek">[http://www.newsweek.com/id/202730 "Kathryn Bigelow: Road Warrior"] – an interview published June 2009 in ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine</ref>}}
Bigelow's 1995 film ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'' was written and produced by her ex-husband [[James Cameron]]. Despite some positive reviews, the film was a commercial failure. Furthermore, many attributed the creative vision to James Cameron, diminishing Bigelow's perceived influence on the film.<ref name=Benson01/>

She directed episodes of ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' in 1997 and 1998.

Based on [[Anita Shreve]]'s [[The Weight of Water|novel of the same name]], Bigelow's 2000 film ''[[The Weight of Water (film)|The Weight of Water]]'' is a portrait of two women trapped in suffocating relationships.

In 2002 she directed ''[[K-19: The Widowmaker]]'', starring [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Liam Neeson]], about a group of men aboard the Soviet Union's first nuclear-powered submarine. The film fared poorly at the box office and was received with mixed reactions by critics, gaining an aggregate score of 58 on [[Metacritic]].
[[Image:Kathryn Bigelow 02.jpg|thumb|right|Bigelow speaking at the 2009 [[Seattle International Film Festival]]]]
Bigelow next directed ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', which was first shown at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in September 2008, was the Closing Night selection for [[Maryland Film Festival]] in May 2009, and theatrically released in the US in June 2009.  It qualified for the [[82nd Academy Awards|2010 Oscars]] as it did not premiere in an Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009. Set in [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|post-invasion Iraq]], the film received "universal acclaim" (according to [[Metacritic]])<ref name="MCreviews">{{metacritic film|id=the-hurt-locker| title=The Hurt Locker}}</ref> and a 97% "fresh" rating from the critics aggregated by [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref name="RTreviews">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hurt_locker|title=The Hurt Locker (2009)|date=December 15, 2009|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=January 25, 2013}}</ref> The film stars [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Brian Geraghty]] and [[Anthony Mackie]], with cameos by [[Guy Pearce]], [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]] and [[Ralph Fiennes]].

Bigelow's next film was ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'', a dramatization of American efforts to find [[Osama bin Laden]]. ''Zero Dark Thirty'' was acclaimed by film critics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/zero-dark-thirty|title=Zero Dark Thirty|work=Metacritic|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref> but it has also attracted controversy and strong criticism for its allegedly pro-torture stance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/jan/09/zero-dark-thirty-premiere-protest|title=Zero Dark Thirty premiere sparks anti-torture protest|date=January 9, 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=January 15, 2013 | location=London | first=Ben | last=Child}}</ref> Bigelow won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director]] for the film, making her the first woman to win the award twice.

==Other work==
In the early 1980s, Bigelow modeled for a [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] advertisement. Her acting credits include [[Lizzie Borden (director)|Lizzie Borden]]'s 1983 film ''[[Born in Flames]]'' as a feminist newspaper editor, and as the leader of a cowgirl gang in the 1988 music video of [[Martini Ranch]]'s "Reach", which was directed by her ex-husband, James Cameron.

==Personal life==
Bigelow was married to fellow director [[James Cameron]] from 1989 to 1991. She and Cameron were both nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] at the 2010 [[82nd Academy Awards]], which Bigelow won.
