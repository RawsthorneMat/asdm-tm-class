'''John Campbell McTiernan, Jr.''' (born January 8, 1951) is an American filmmaker, best known for his [[action movie|action films]] and most identifiable with the three films he directed back-to-back: the science fiction action film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987), the action film ''[[Die Hard]]'' (1988), which has sometimes been called one of the [[List of films considered the best#Action|greatest action movies ever made]],<ref name="pajiba">{{cite web | url=http://www.pajiba.com/guides/the-best-action-films-of-all-time.php | title=Die Hard is #1 according to Pajiba.com | publisher=Pajiba.com | accessdate=November 2, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Yippie-ki-Yay">{{cite web | url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2009/07/the-50-greatest-action-movies-of-all-time/die-hard | title=Die Hard is the last mentioned on Complex. | publisher=Complex.com | accessdate=November 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN1448232520070615|title="Die Hard" tops magazine list of best action films|work=[[Reuters]] | date=2007-06-15}}</ref> and the action thriller ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990). He is also known for later films, such as the action-comedy-fantasy film ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' (1993), the action film sequel ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), the heist film-remake ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1999) and the mystery-thriller ''[[Basic (film)|Basic]]'' (2003).

He was convicted of perjury and lying to an FBI investigator after hiring the private investigator [[Anthony Pellicano]] in late 2000 to illegally wiretap the phone calls of two people, one of whom was [[Charles Roven]], a co-producer of his dystopian science-fiction action film remake ''[[Rollerball (2002 film)|Rollerball]]'' (2002).<ref name=NinthOpinion/> He was incarcerated in federal prison from April 2013 to February 2014. During his imprisonment, he declared bankruptcy amidst foreclosure proceedings for his ranch residence and struggles to pay legal fees and IRS tax debt.<ref name=Nightmare/>

==Background and career==
McTiernan was born in [[Albany, New York]], and attended the [[Juilliard School]] before graduating with a [[Master of Fine Arts]] from the [[AFI Conservatory]]. In 1986, he wrote and directed his first feature film, ''[[Nomads (1986 film)|Nomads]]'', starring [[Pierce Brosnan]]. While not commercially successful, it did land him the job of directing the science fiction action hit ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' starring [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. In the wake of that film's success, he went on to direct two more hits – ''[[Die Hard]]'' in 1988 starring [[Bruce Willis]] and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' in 1990 with [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Sean Connery]].

He then produced ''[[Flight of the Intruder]]'', a 1991 film about an American bomber crew in Vietnam starring [[Danny Glover]], [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Brad Johnson (actor)|Brad Johnson]], which was poorly received, and directed ''[[Medicine Man (film)|Medicine Man]]'', a 1992 film about a medical researcher in a rainforest starring Sean Connery, which managed to cover expenses but was negatively reviewed by most critics.

He directed and co-produced the 1993 film ''[[Last Action Hero]]'', an action-comedy vehicle for [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. The film was rushed into production, and opened to generally negative reviews and poor box office results. In 1995, he rebounded with ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', the third installment of the [[Die Hard (film series)|''Die Hard'' film series]]. It was highly successful – garnering $366M in box office receipts and becoming the highest-grossing film of the year.<ref name="BOM">{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=diehardwithavengeance.htm|title=Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995)|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=1 December 2008}}</ref>

He directed the 1999 film ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', a heist film remake starring Pierce Brosnan and [[Rene Russo]], which opened to solid reviews and strong box office results. In the same year was the release of the troubled production of ''[[The 13th Warrior]]'', adapted from the novel ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]].

McTiernan then directed the 2002 film ''[[Rollerball (2002 film)|Rollerball]]'', a science fiction remake starring [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]], [[Jean Reno]], and [[LL Cool J]]. As of early 2015, his last film to date was the 2003 thriller ''[[Basic (film)|Basic]]'' with [[John Travolta]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Neither of those films was considered a success.

==Personal life==

===Criminal charges, felony conviction, and incarceration===
On April 3, 2006, McTiernan was charged in federal court with making a false statement to an FBI investigator in February 2006 about his hiring the private investigator [[Anthony Pellicano]] to illegally wiretap [[Charles Roven]], the producer of his ''[[Rollerball (2002 film)|Rollerball]]'' film, around August 2000.<ref name=NinthOpinion/><ref name=Steinberg/><ref name=Halbfinger/> McTiernan had been in a disagreement with Roven about what type of film ''Rollerball'' should be, and had hired Pellicano to investigate Roven's intentions and actions.<ref name=MacAskill/> He had asked Pellicano to try to find instances where Roven made negative remarks about the studio executives or said things to others what were inconsistent with what he said to the studio.<ref name=NinthOpinion/>

He was arraigned and pleaded guilty on April 17, 2006, as part of an initial [[plea bargain]] agreement to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for lenient treatment.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-pellicano4apr04,0,7658828,print.story "Pellicano Inquiry Expands to Snare Director of 'Predator'"]{{dead link|date=April 2015}} by Kim Christensen and Greg Krikorian, April 4, 2006, ''Los Angeles Times''.</ref> Prosecutors said they then became convinced that he was continuing to lie to them and that he had also hired Pellicano to wiretap someone else – probably his estranged wife Donna Dubrow during their 1997 divorce, and they decided to seek a prison sentence.<ref name=Halbfinger/> He then hired new counsel and tried to withdraw his guilty plea – saying his prior counsel had not conducted a proper [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] in the case and had not presented him with the available defense approach of suppressing as evidence the conversation with him that Pellicano had recorded on August 17, 2000, but this bid was denied by the [[Federal District Judge]], [[Dale S. Fischer]], who immediately proceeded to sentence him to four months in prison and $100,000 in fines.<ref name=Steinberg>{{cite web|last=Steinberg |first=Brian |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972627.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=John McTiernan sentenced to prison: {{'}}''Die Hard''{{'}} director lied to FBI about Pellicano |publisher=Variety |date=September 24, 2007 |accessdate=June 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=NinthOpinion/> The judge characterized McTiernan as someone who thought he was "above the law", had shown no remorse, and "lived a privileged life and simply wants to continue that".<ref name=Halbfinger/> He was ordered to surrender for incarceration by January 15, 2008, but was allowed to remain out of prison on bail pending an appeal to the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]].<ref name=Halbfinger>David M. Halbfinger and Allison Hope Weiner, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/25/business/media/25hollywood.html Movie Director Sentenced for Lying About Detective] ''New York Times''.

In October 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] McTiernan's four-month sentence and ruled that Judge Fischer had erred and he was entitled to a hearing as to whether his plea could be withdrawn.<ref name=NinthOpinion/> The prosecution (and the judge) then agreed to allow McTiernan to withdraw his plea rather than proceed with such a hearing, and his plea was withdrawn on February 24, 2009.<ref name=NinthOpinion/><ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090224/ap_en_mo/hollywood_wiretaps;_ylt=Am8.7Gvo9Dks.8mNub5SIrxxFb8C Die Hard Director Allowed to Withdraw Plea]{{dead link|date=April 2015}} Yahoo News, February 24, 2009.</ref>

With the case reopened, the prosecution was no longer bound by the prior plea agreement, and filed additional charges against McTiernan, charging him with ''two'' counts of lying to the FBI (one count for claiming he had hired Pellicano only in connection with his divorce proceedings and another for denying he had ever discussed wiretapping with Pellicano) and one count of committing perjury during the previous court proceedings by denying he had been coached by his attorney on what to say during his previous guilty plea hearing (a denial that he later signed a declaration saying was false).<ref name=NinthOpinion/><ref name="pacer">{{cite web|url=http://www.pacer.gov/ |title=Public Access to Court Electronic Records |publisher=Pacer.gov |date= |accessdate=May 24, 2013}}</ref> After some adverse rulings on his attempted defense arguments, and facing the possibility of a prison sentence of more than five years on the various charges, McTiernan eventually entered another guilty plea (on all three counts) in a second plea bargain in 2010, conditioned on his plan to appeal the earlier rulings against his defense approach, and Judge Fischer sentenced him to one year in prison, three years of supervised probation, and a fine of $100,000.<ref name=OneYear/> The judge said that the increased length of the prison sentence was related to the additional, more serious charge of perjury before her court, that McTiernan's crimes were more than just a momentary lapse of judgment, that he still did not seem to have really accepted responsibility for his actions, and that she would have issued an even more lengthy prison sentence if the prosecution had not recommended less.<ref name=OneYear/> McTiernan was then released on bail pending an appeal of the adverse rulings.<ref name=OneYear>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118025109.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 Judge Sentences McTiernan to One Year in Prison] Variety, October 4, 2010.</ref>

On August 20, 2012, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals [[Affirmed in law|affirmed]] the district court judgment, but allowed McTiernan to address the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] regarding his attempt to suppress the recorded conversation before being required to report to prison.<ref name=NinthOpinion>[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2012/08/20/10-50500.pdf Court Opinion], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], August 20, 2012.</ref> McTiernan's defense had tried to argue that Pellicano had made the recording for an unlawful purpose and that this made it inadmissible, but the district and appeals courts disagreed with that interpretation of the rules of evidence.<ref name=NinthOpinion/> On January 14, 2013, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/die-hard-director-john-mctiernan-412690 | author=Block, Alex Ben | title='Die Hard' Director John McTiernan Headed to Prison After Supreme Court Denies Appeal | date=January 15, 2013 | accessdate=January 15, 2013 | publisher=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''}}</ref>

McTiernan surrendered to federal prison on April 3, 2013, to serve a stated 12-month sentence in the [[Federal Prison Camp, Yankton]], in [[Yankton, South Dakota]], a minimum-security former college campus holding about 800 male mainly white-collar criminal offenders.<ref>Michael Hustings.

===Invasion of privacy civil suit===
On July 3, 2006, McTiernan's former wife, film producer Donna Dubrow, filed suit against him for [[invasion of privacy]] and other claims arising from her belief that he hired Pellicano to wiretap her telephone during their divorce negotiations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hollywood.com, LLC |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/detail/id/3527661 |title='Die Hard' Director Sued for Invasion of Privacy |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=July 4, 2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2013|archiveurl=http://archive.is/VNuUs|archivedate=January 25, 2013}}</ref> As of May, 2014, the lawsuit remained active, with a trial scheduled for December 2014 but likely to be postponed.<ref name=Nightmare>{{cite web |last=Gardner |first=Eriq |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/detail/id/3527661 |title=John McTiernan's Prison Nightmare: 'Die Hard' Director Fights Foreclosure as He Plots Comeback |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 28, 2014 |accessdate=April 24, 2015 }}</ref>

===Debts and bankruptcy===
In October 2013, while in prison, McTiernan declared [[chapter 11 bankruptcy]] amidst foreclosure proceedings for his 3,254-acre (1,317 hectare) ranch residence in central Wyoming (valued at $8–10M), struggles to pay his past legal bills and IRS tax debts, and ongoing expensive disputes including the lawsuit by his ex-wife, a $5M claim against him of liability in a 2011 automobile accident, and his ongoing effort to reverse his felony conviction.<ref name=Nightmare/> The bank holding the mortgage on the ranch said the filing was a bad-faith tactic only intended to stall the foreclosure proceedings, and requested the presiding judge to convert the case to a [[chapter 7 bankruptcy]] – a more drastic form of bankruptcy that would give the bank the power to demand the liquidation of assets rather than requiring them to negotiate with McTiernan.<ref name=Nightmare/><ref name=Reveals/> McTiernan's lawyers countered by saying that his potential for generating additional future income from new projects could enable him to eventually repay his debts, so a rapid liquidation of assets would be unnecessary and unjustified.<ref name=Nightmare/><ref name=Reveals/> In the bankruptcy proceedings, he identified two likely future film projects with [[Hannibal Pictures]], with [[working title]]s ''Red Squad'' and ''Warbirds'', with large budgets and significant likely future income and planned to star major well-known actors.<ref name=Reveals>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/die-hard-director-john-mctiernan-729029 |last=Gardner |first=Eriq | title='Die Hard' Director John McTiernan Reveals Next Film Projects at Bankruptcy Hearing | date=August 29, 2014 | accessdate=April 25, 2015 | publisher=''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''}}</ref>
