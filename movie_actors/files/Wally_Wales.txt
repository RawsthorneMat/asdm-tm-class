==Biography==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:WallyWales-TrailsOfDanger lobby card.jpg|thumb|240px|right| Early Sound film starring Wally Wales.]] -->
Wally Wales was born '''Floyd Taliaferro Alderson''' in [[Sheridan, Wyoming]].<ref name="Huey)">{{cite book|author=Huey, William R.|id=|location= |title=In Search of Hollywood, Wyoming, 1894-The Silent Years-1921|year=1985|publisher=William R. Huey}}</ref><ref>U.S. Census, 1900, Rosebud County, Montana</ref>  He was raised on his family's ranch, near Birney in Rosebud County, Montana.<ref name="ReferenceA">University of Wyoming Archive Catalog description, Wally Wales Papers</ref><ref>Anderson, Chuck, ''The Old Corral'', http://www.b-westerns.com/wales1.htm</ref>

Young Floyd's first "outside" job was on a cattle drive for [[John B. Kendrick]].  He also drove a tourist stage for the [[Buffalo Bill]] Stage line before drifting west in 1915 ending up in [[Los Angeles]] where he went to work as a [[wrangler (profession)|wrangler]] on [[Universal Studios|Universal's]] Ranch.

In 1917 he joined the army and served in the American Expeditionary Forces in France.

From 1921 through 1928 he appeared in twenty-two silent films, starring in many (mainly Westerns) under the name Wally Wales, and in 1929 made the successful transition to sound.  Subsequently his star faded and he began appearing in much smaller roles, usually as Hal Taliaferro.

He retired from films in the early 1950s and returned to the family ranch, now known as the Bones Brothers Ranch (listed on the National Historical Register in 2004).  He built a cabin there and lived out his remaining active years painting landscapes.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> 

He died in a Sheridan, Wyoming nursing home from complications of a stroke and [[pneumonia]] in 1980, at age 84.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
