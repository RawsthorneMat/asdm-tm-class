'''Noah Lindsey Beery''' (August 10, 1913 &ndash; November 1, 1994), known professionally as '''Noah Beery, Jr.''' or just '''Noah Beery''', was an American actor specializing in warm, friendly character parts similar to the ones played by his uncle, [[Wallace Beery]], although Noah Beery, Jr., unlike his uncle, seldom broke away from playing supporting roles. Beery's father, Noah Nicholas Beery (known professionally as Noah Beery or [[Noah Beery, Sr.]]), enjoyed a similarly lengthy film career as a major supporting actor.

Beery was best known as [[James Garner]]'s father, '''Joseph "Rocky" Rockford''', in the [[NBC]] [[television series]] ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' (1974-80).

Beery was born in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], where his father was working as a stage actor.  He was given his nickname "Pidge" by [[George M. Cohan]]'s sister Josie.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/4984/Noah-Beery-Jr-/biography | title=Noah Beery Jr. - Biography - Movies & TV - NYTimes.com | publisher=New York Times | accessdate=23 October 2014 }}</ref>  The family moved to [[California]] in 1915 when his father began acting in [[motion picture]]s. After attending school in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], they moved to a ranch in the [[San Fernando Valley]], a style of living he would maintain for the rest of his life.

At the age of seven, he appeared with his father in ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' and like his father, who immediately began billing himself as "Noah Beery, Sr.," he went on to become a respected character actor.  His uncle, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]]-winning screen phenomenon [[Wallace Beery]], became the world's highest-paid actor by 1932, and while neither Noah nor his father ever approached that level, both had extremely long and memorable film careers. All three acting Beerys physically resembled each other rather closely, but Noah, Jr. lacked a thrillingly powerful voice like his father's and uncle's (which is ironic, since both older Beerys made major careers in silent movies).

Beery appeared in dozens of films, including a large early role as [[John Wayne]]'s action partner in 1934's ''[[The Trail Beyond]]'' (Wayne was 27 years old and Beery was 21), ''[[20 Mule Team (1940 film)|20 Mule Team]]'' with his uncle, and ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' with [[John Wayne|Wayne]], but is best known for his role as Joseph "Rocky" Rockford, the father of Jim Rockford, [[James Garner]]'s character on the popular [[television series]] ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' (1974–1980). Beery's television work also included a weekly stint as a clown in ''[[Circus Boy]]'' with [[Micky Dolenz]] in the mid-1950s.

In 1960, as the character Bill Blake, Beery replaced [[Burt Reynolds]] in the co-starring role in ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]],'' an [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series starring [[Darren McGavin]]. He appeared once on the religion anthology series ''[[Crossroads (1955 TV series)|Crossroads]]'' and on [[Walter Brennan]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom, ''[[The Real McCoys]]''. He guest-starred three times on the long-running NBC western series, ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' in the 1960s. In 1965, he made two guest appearances on ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' starring [[Raymond Burr]]: he first played murderer Tony Claus in "The Case of the Golden Venom," then played defendant Lucas Tolliver in "The Case of the Hasty Honeymooner."

==Death==
Beery, Jr., died in 1994 in [[Tehachapi, California|Tehachapi]], California, of a [[cerebral thrombosis]] and  his remains were interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] with those of his father and mother, Margarite Lindsey.  His uncle Wallace Beery's remains are interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]]. Beery, Jr.'s first wife until 1966 was Maxine Jones, the only child of Western star [[Buck Jones]]. His second wife from 1968 until his death was Lisa Thorman. He was survived by his wife, Lisa; two daughters, Muffett and Melissa; a son, actor [[Bucklind Beery]]; and three step-children, Page, Sean, and Lorena. His television star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is at 7021 Hollywood Blvd.
