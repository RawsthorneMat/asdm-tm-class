'''Shelton Jackson "Spike" Lee''' (born March 20, 1957) is an American film director, producer, writer, and actor. His production company, [[40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks]], has produced over 35 films since 1983.

Lee's movies have examined [[race relations]], [[colorism]] in the black community, the role of media in contemporary life, urban crime and poverty, and other political issues. Lee has received two [[Academy Award]] nominations and won numerous other awards, including an [[Emmy Award]] as well as the 2013 [[The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize|Gish Prize]] "for his brilliance and unwavering courage in using film to challenge conventional thinking."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-24158700 |title= Spike Lee wins $300,000 Gish Prize |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= 30 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bet.com/news/celebrities/2013/09/20/spike-lee-awarded-300-000-prize-from-dorothy-and-lillian-gish-foundation.html |title= Spike Lee Awarded $300,000 Prize From Dorothy and Lillian Gish Foundation |publisher= BET: Black Entertainment Television |accessdate= 30 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-spike-lee-awarded-gish-prize-20130918,0,5323916.story#axzz30OykLTfs |title= Spike Lee awarded $300,000 Gish Prize |publisher= Los Angeles Times |accessdate= 30 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/brief/55033668/spike-lee-to-receive-prestigious-lillian-gish-award |title= Spike Lee to receive prestigious Lillian Gish award |publisher= Hollywood |accessdate= 1 May 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Lee was born in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, the son of Jacqueline Carroll (née Shelton), a teacher of arts and black literature, and [[Bill Lee (musician)|William James Edward Lee III]], a jazz musician and composer.<ref name="filmrefbio" /><ref name="refwho" /> Lee also had three younger siblings [[Joie Lee|Joie]], [[David Lee (still photographer)|David]], and [[Cinqué Lee|Cinqué]], who all worked in many different positions in Lee's films. Director [[Malcolm D. Lee]] is his cousin. When he was a child, the family moved to [[Brooklyn]], New York. During his childhood, his mother nicknamed him "Spike". In Brooklyn, he attended [[John Dewey High School]].

Lee enrolled in [[Morehouse College]], a [[historically black college]], where he made his first student film, ''Last Hustle in Brooklyn''. He took film courses at [[Clark Atlanta University]] and graduated with a BA in [[Mass Communication]] from Morehouse. He did graduate work at [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], where he earned a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in Film & Television.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.morehouse.edu/about/boardbios/slee.html | publisher=Morehouse College | title=SHELTON "SPIKE" LEE '79 | date=April 9, 2012 | accessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref>

===Film===

[[File:Spike Lee.jpg|thumb|right|Lee in 2007]]
Lee's thesis film, ''[[Joe's Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads]]'', was the first student film to be showcased in [[Lincoln Center]]'s New Directors New Films Festival.

In 1985, Lee began work on his first feature film, ''[[She's Gotta Have It]]''. With a budget of $175,000, he shot the film in two weeks. When the film was released in 1986, it grossed over $7,000,000 at the U.S. box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=shesgottahaveit.htm |title=She's Gotta Have It (1986) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=August 26, 1986 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

Lee's 1989 film ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Original Screenplay in 1989. Many people, including Hollywood's [[Kim Basinger]] believed that ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' also deserved a Best Picture nomination. ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'' won Best Picture that year. Lee said in an April 7, 2006 interview with ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine that the other film's success, which he thought was based on safe stereotypes, hurt him more than if his film had not been nominated for an award.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hill |first=Logan |url=http://nymag.com/anniversary/40th/culture/45772/ |title=Q&A with Spike Lee on Making 'Do the Right Thing |work=New York |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

After the 1990 release of ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]'', Lee was accused of [[antisemitism]] by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and several film critics. They criticized the characters of the club owners Josh and Moe Flatbush, described as "[[Shylock]]s". Lee denied the charge, explaining that he wrote those characters in order to depict how black artists struggled against exploitation. Lee said that [[Lew Wasserman]], [[Sidney Sheinberg]] or Tom Pollock, the Jewish heads of MCA and [[Universal Studios]], were unlikely to allow antisemitic content in a film they produced. He said he could not make an antisemitic film because Jews run Hollywood, and "that's a fact."<ref name=Times900816>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/16/movies/critic-s-notebook-spike-lee-s-jews-passage-benign-cliche-into-bigotry.html |title=Spike Lee's Jews and the Passage From Benign Cliche into Bigotry |last=James |first=Caryn |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 16, 1990 |accessdate=December 1, 2009}}</ref>

His 1997 documentary ''[[4 Little Girls]],'' about the children killed in the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] in 1963, was nominated for the Best Feature Documentary [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]].

On May 2, 2007, the 50th [[San Francisco International Film Festival]] honored Spike Lee with the [[San Francisco Film Society]]'s Directing Award. He received the 2008 Wexner Prize.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wexarts.org/about/wexner_prize/spikelee/ |title="Spike Lee to Receive the Wexner Prize"; Wexner Center for the Arts |publisher=Wexarts.org |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>  In 2013, he won [[The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize]], one of the [[List of the world's richest literary prizes|richest prizes in the American arts]] worth $300,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-spike-lee-awarded-gish-prize-20130918,0,5323916.story |title=Spike Lee awarded $300,000 Gish Prize  |work=[[LA Times]] |author=Chris Lee |date=September 18, 2013 |accessdate=September 19, 2013}}</ref>

Lee's films are typically referred to as "Spike Lee Joints" and the closing credits always end with the phrases "By Any Means Necessary", "Ya Dig" and "Sho Nuff".<ref>{{cite web

===Commercials===
In mid-1990, [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] began producing a series of TV commercials directed by Lee for their 501 button fly jeans.<ref>Elliott, Stuart (July 22, 1991).

They wanted to pair Lee's character, the Michael Jordan-loving [[Mars Blackmon]], and Jordan in a marketing campaign for the [[Air Jordan]] line. Later, Lee was called on to comment on the controversy surrounding the inner-city rash of violence involving youths trying to steal Air Jordans from other kids.<ref>[http://chucksconnection.com/articles/ConverseArt08.html Chucksconnection.com]</ref> He said that, rather than blaming manufacturers of apparel that gained popularity, "deal with the conditions that make a kid put so much importance on a pair of sneakers, a jacket and gold".

Through the marketing wing of 40 Acres and a Mule, Lee has directed commercials for [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]], [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]], [[Taco Bell]] and [[Ben & Jerry's]].

==Controversial remarks==
[[File:SpikeLeeSept2011.jpg|thumb|right|Lee in September 2011]]
As Lee became more well known and his work and comments were followed more closely, he became embroiled in some controversies.

In May 1999, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Lee made an inflammatory comment about [[Charlton Heston]], president of the [[National Rifle Association]], while speaking to reporters at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Lee was quoted as saying the National Rifle Association should be disbanded and, of Heston, someone should "Shoot him with a [[.44 Bull Dog]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-05-28/news/9905290188_1_nra-president-rash-of-school-shootings-remarks |title=Spike Lee Says Remark About Shooting Heston Was A Joke – Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=May 28, 1999 |accessdate=February 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/08/entertainment/et-hestonletters8 |title=Heston was always a man of his words – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=February 13, 2013}}</ref> Lee said he intended it as a joke. He was responding to coverage about whether Hollywood was responsible for school shootings. Lee said, "The problem is guns," he said.<ref name="Salon"/> [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] condemned Lee as having "nothing to offer the debate on school violence except more violence and more hate."<ref name="Salon">{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/ent/log/1999/05/28/spike/index.html |title=Living foot to mouth |publisher=Salon.com |date=May 28, 1999 |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

In October 2005, Lee responded to a [[CNN]] anchor's question as to whether the government intentionally ignored the plight of black Americans during the [[Hurricane Katrina#Federal government|2005 Hurricane Katrina catastrophe]] by saying, "It's not too far-fetched. I don't put anything past the United States government. I don't find it too far-fetched that they tried to displace all the black people out of [[New Orleans]]."<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QroaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R0UEAAAAIBAJ&dq=far-fetched%20that%20they%20tried%20to%20displace%20all%20the%20black%20people&pg=6597%2C2786253 Lee Won't Dismiss Theories Of A Flooding Conspiracy]</ref>  In later comments, Lee cited the government's past atrocities including the [[Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male]].<ref>[http://www.sootoday.com/content/arts/details.asp?c=14840 All about Spike Lee's latest film]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=R7j0SqSn14A |title=Clip of Lee expressing his views of the Hurricane Katrina and Tuskegee matters on '&#39;Real Time with Bill Maher'&#39; |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, Lee, who was then making ''[[Miracle at St. Anna]],'' about an all-black U.S. division fighting in Italy during [[World War II]], criticized director [[Clint Eastwood]] for not depicting black Marines in his own WWII film, ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]''. Citing historical accuracy, Eastwood responded that his film was specifically about the Marines who raised the flag on [[Mount Suribachi]] at [[Iwo Jima]], pointing out that while black Marines did fight at Iwo Jima, the U.S. military was segregated during WWII, and none of the men who raised the flag were black. He angrily said that Lee should "shut his face". Lee responded that Eastwood was acting like an "angry old man", and incorrectly<ref>black Marines (including an all-black unit) are seen in scenes during which the mission is outlined, as well as during the initial landings, when a wounded black Marine is carried away. During the end credits, historical photographs taken during the Battle of Iwo Jima show black Marines.</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=December 2014}} argued that despite making two Iwo Jima films back to back, ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'' and ''Flags of Our Fathers'', "there was not one black soldier in both of those films".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5015524|last=Marikar|first=Sheila|title=Spike Strikes Back: Clint's 'an Angry Old Man|publisher=ABC News|date=June 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7439371.stm|publisher=BBC News Online|title=Eastwood hits back at Lee claims|date=June 6, 2008|accessdate=August 4, 2009}}</ref><ref name="thr">{{cite journal  | last = Lyman  | first = Eric J.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Lee calls out Eastwood, Coens over casting  | journal = [[The Hollywood Reporter]], The Daily from Cannes  | volume =  | issue = 8  | pages = 3, 24

In March 2012, after the [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]], Spike Lee was one of many people who used Twitter to circulate a message which claimed to give the home address of the shooter [[George Zimmerman]]. The address turned out to be incorrect, causing the real occupants, Elaine and David McClain, to leave home and stay at a hotel due to numerous death threats.<ref name=tsgtwit/> Lee issued an apology and reached an agreement with the McClains which reportedly included "compensation", with their attorney stating "The McClains’ claim is fully resolved".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/03/28/justice/florida-teen-spike-lee/?hpt=us_c2|title=Spike Lee apologizes for retweeting wrong Zimmerman address |publisher=CNN |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-trayvon-martin-lee-settlement-20120329,0,7063902.story|title=Trayvon Martin: Spike Lee settles with family forced to flee home|first=Michael|last=Muskal|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> Nevertheless, in November 2013, the McClains filed a negligence lawsuit which accused Lee of "encouraging a dangerous mob mentality among his Twitter followers, as well as the public-at-large".<ref name=tsgtwit>{{cite web |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/spike-lee-tweet-lawsuit-675413 |title=Elderly Couple Sues Spike Lee Over Tweet |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |date=November 8, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/spike-lee-sued-over-george-zimmerman-tweet-165719017--abc-news-topstories.html |title=Spike Lee Sued Over George Zimmerman Tweet |work=ABC News |author=Colleen Curry |date=November 11, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2013}}</ref> The lawsuit, which a court filing reportedly valued at $1.2 million, alleged that the couple suffered "injuries and damages" that continued after the initial settlement up through [[State of Florida v.
