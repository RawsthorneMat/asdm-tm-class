==Career==

===Early career===

<blockquote>
Let's see. Did I not wanna do it? Um. I was game. I was trying different things. It sounded better than college. I didn't really think about the public aspect of it. That took me by surprise. The whole reaction. People felt very attached to the Godfather films. I grew up with them being no big deal. I mean, I understand they're great films but... I dunno. I'm not surprised. It makes sense that people would have an opinion about it but I got a lot of attention I wasn't expecting. I was going to art school anyway so I was able to get back to what I was doing. It was before the Internet so magazines would come out but then the next month they were gone. There wasn't even as much paparazzi around then.<ref name="Ryan"/></blockquote>

Coppola also acted in her father's films ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]] (1983)'', in a scene where [[Matt Dillon]], [[C. Thomas Howell|Tommy Howell]], and [[Ralph Macchio]] are eating at a [[Dairy Queen]], ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' (1983), ''The Cotton Club'' (1984), and as [[Kathleen Turner]]'s sister Nancy Kelcher in ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married (film)|Peggy Sue Got Married]]'' (1986).<ref name="Tribute">{{cite web|title=Sofia Coppola Biography|url=http://www.tribute.ca/people/sofia-coppola/5248/|work=tribute.ca|publisher=Tribute Entertainment Media Group|accessdate=July 5, 2013|year=2013}}</ref>

After she was critically panned for her performance in ''The Godfather Part III'', for which she was named "Worst Supporting Actress" and "Worst New Star" at the [[1990 Golden Raspberry Awards]], Coppola ended her acting career; although, she appeared in the 1992 independent film ''[[Inside Monkey Zetterland]]'', as well as in the backgrounds of films by her friends and family; for example, she appeared as [[Saché]] in [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' in 1999.<ref name="Ryan"/> She has since been quoted as saying that she was not hurt by the criticism from her role in ''The Godfather Part III'', because she never especially wanted an acting career.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/arts/out-of-the-godfathers-shadow-514061.html |title=Out of the Godfather's shadow |publisher=The Independent |date=April 30, 2000|accessdate=August 27, 2012}}</ref>

Coppola also appears in several music videos from the 1990s: [[The Black Crowes]]' "Sometimes Salvation"; [[Sonic Youth]]'s "Mildred Pierce"; [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Deeper and Deeper]]"; the [[Chemical Brothers]]' "[[Elektrobank]]", which was directed by her future husband [[Spike Jonze]]; and later [[Phoenix (band)|Phoenix]]'s "Funky Squaredance".<ref name="Ryan"/>

===Filmmaking===
Coppola's first short-film was ''[[Lick the Star]]'' (1998). It played many times on the [[Independent Film Channel]]. She made her feature-film directing debut with ''[[The Virgin Suicides (film)|The Virgin Suicides]]'' (1999). It premiered in North America at the 2000 [[Sundance Film Festival]] and was released later that year.

Her second feature was ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' (2003). Coppola won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for her original screenplay and three [[Golden Globe Award]]s including Best Picture Musical or Comedy. After [[Lina Wertmüller]] and [[Jane Campion]], Coppola became the third female director to be nominated for an Academy Award for Directing and the second to win the Original Screenplay award, after Campion in 1994 (Wertmüller was also nominated), thus making a pattern for the female directors to be nominated for both awards. Her win for best original screenplay in 2003 made her a third-generation Oscar winner. In 2004, Coppola was invited to join the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].<ref>[http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2004/04.06.28.html Academy Invites 127 to Membership]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

Her third film was the [[biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'', adapted from the biography by British historian [[Antonia Fraser]].

It debuted at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4352266/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Marie Antoinette |accessdate=December 13, 2009|work=Cannes}}</ref> where, despite boos in the audience, it received a standing ovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigscreenlittlescreen.net/2006/10/20/marie-antoinette-a-quotational-reference/ |title=Marie Antoinette - a Quotational Reference Guide |publisher=Big Screen Little Screen |accessdate=August 27, 2012}}</ref> Critics were divided.

In 1998, she cofounded the clothing line ''Milk Fed'' in Japan with friend Stephanie Hayman in cooperation with [[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Kim Gordon]].

In 2002, fashion designer [[Marc Jacobs]] chose the actress/director to be the 'face' of his house's fragrance. The campaign involved photographs of her shot by photographer [[Juergen Teller]] in his signature over-exposed style.

In the July 2013 issue of [[Elle (magazine)|Elle Magazine]], photographs shot by Coppola of [[Paris Hilton]] at her Beverly Hills mansion (which makes a cameo in ''[[The Bling Ring]]'') were featured.<ref>http://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/paris-hilton-home-fashion#slide-1 Elle.

===Awards===
Coppola was nominated for three Academy Awards for her 2003 film ''Lost in Translation'', in the categories of [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award For Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. She would go on to win for [[Academy Award For Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], but lost the other two nominations to Peter Jackson's ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.

Her nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] made her the first American woman in history to be nominated in that category, and the third overall, after [[Lina Wertmüller]] and [[Jane Campion]]. In 2010, [[Kathryn Bigelow]] became the fourth woman to be nominated, and the first to win the award. Coppola, however, remains the youngest woman to be nominated in the Best Director category.

Her win for Best Original Screenplay resulted in her family becoming the second three-generation Oscar winning family, her grandfather [[Carmine Coppola]] and her father [[Francis Ford Coppola]] having previously won Oscars. The first family to achieve this feat was the Huston family: [[Walter Huston|Walter]], [[John Huston|John]], and [[Anjelica Huston|Anjelica]].

For her work on ''Lost in Translation'', Coppola also won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] Golden Globe and received a BAFTA nomination.

==Personal life==
In 1999, Coppola married director [[Spike Jonze]], whom she had first met in 1992, and they divorced in 2003.
