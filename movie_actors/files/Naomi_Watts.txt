==Career==

===1986–2000: Early work and struggling career===
Watts' career began in television, where she made brief appearances in commercials.<ref name=biochannel/> The 1986 film ''[[For Love Alone]]'', set in the 1930s and based on [[Christina Stead]]'s 1945 best-selling novel of the same name, marked her debut in film.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/18132/For-Love-Alone/overview|title=For Love Alone (1986) Overview|work=The New York Times|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> She then appeared in two episodes of the [[List of Hey Dad..! episodes#Season 4 (1990-1991)|fourth season]] of the Australian sitcom ''[[Hey Dad..!]]'' in 1990. After a five-year absence from films, Watts met director [[John Duigan]] during the 1989 premiere of her friend Nicole Kidman's film ''[[Dead Calm (film)|Dead Calm]]'' and he invited her to take a supporting role in his 1991 indie film ''[[Flirting (film)|Flirting]]''.<ref name=biochannel/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iofilm.co.uk/feats/interviews/n/naomi_watts_divorce.shtml |title=Naomi enjoys her shot|publisher=Iofilm.co.uk|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> She starred opposite future Hollywood up-and-comers Kidman and [[Thandie Newton]].<ref name="Talk Talk"/> The film received critical acclaim and was featured on [[Roger Ebert]]'s list of the 10 best films of 1992.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19921231/COMMENTARY/40308026/1023|first=Roger|last=Ebert|title=The Best 10 Movies of 1992 |work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=31 December 1992|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> Also in 1991, she took the part of Frances Heffernan, a girl who struggles to find friends behind the walls of a Sydney Catholic school,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiantelevision.net/brides-of-christ/episodes.html|title=Brides of Christ: episode guide|work=Australian Television Information Archive's Official Site|publisher=Australian Television Information Archive|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> in the award winning mini-series ''[[Brides of Christ]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shop.abc.net.au/browse/product.asp?productid=721188|title=Brides of Christ description on Australian Broadcasting Corporation's shop|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> and had a recurring role in the soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'' as the handicapped [[List of Home and Away characters (1991)#Julie Gibson|Julie Gibson]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Kent|first=Melissa|work=The Age |location=Australia|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/tv--radio/cast-and-fans-of-home-and-away-well-on-the-way-to-belonging-foreverand-ever/2009/02/07/1233423560588.html|title=Cast and fans of Home and Away well on the way to belonging forever and ever|date=8 February 2009|accessdate=28 August 2011}}</ref> Watts was then offered a role in the drama series ''[[A Country Practice]]'' but turned it down, not wanting to "get stuck on a soap for two or three years", a decision she later called "naïve".<ref name=biochannel/><ref name=interviewmag/>

Watts then took a year off to travel, visiting [[Los Angeles]] and being introduced to agents through Kidman.<ref name=mymotto/><ref name="Talk Talk"/> Encouraged, Watts decided to move to America, to pursue her career further. In 1993 she had a small role in the [[John Goodman]] film ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' and temporarily returned to Australia to star in three Australian films: another of Duigan's pictures, ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea (1993 film)|Wide Sargasso Sea]]''; the drama ''[[The Custodian]]''; and had her first leading role in the film ''Gross Misconduct'', as a student who accuses one of her teachers (played by [[Jimmy Smits]]) of raping her.<ref name=biochannel/> Watts then moved back to America for good but the difficulty of finding agents, producers and directors willing to hire her during that period frustrated her initial efforts.<ref name="Talk Talk"/> Though her financial situation never led her to taking a job out of the film industry, she experienced problems like being unable to pay the rent of her apartment and losing her medical insurance.<ref name="Talk Talk"/><ref name=bloomer/> "At first, everything was fantastic and doors were opened to me. But some people who I met through Nicole [Kidman], who had been all over me, had difficulty remembering my name when we next met. There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off.

You take all their flattery seriously when you don't know any better. I basically had to start all over again. I get offered some things without auditioning today, but back then they wouldn't even fax me the pages of a script because it was too much of an inconvenience.

She then won a supporting role in the futuristic 1995 film ''[[Tank Girl (film)|Tank Girl]]'', winning the role of "Jet Girl" after nine auditions.<ref name=tca/> While the film was met with mixed reviews, it flopped at the box office, although it has gone on to become something of a cult classic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tank_girl/|title=Tank Girl (1995) on Rotten Tomatoes|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster, Inc|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> Throughout the rest of the decade, she took mostly supporting roles in films<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/naomi-watts/bio/167538|title=Naomi Watts: Biography|work=TV Guide|publisher=TV Guide Online Holdings LLC|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> and occasionally considered leaving the business, but: "there were always little bites.

In 1997, she starred in the Australian ensemble romantic drama ''[[Under the Lighthouse Dancing]]'' and also played the lead role in the short-lived television series ''[[Sleepwalkers (TV series)|Sleepwalkers]]''.<ref name="Talk Talk"/> In 1998, she starred alongside [[Neil Patrick Harris]] and [[Debbie Reynolds]] in the TV film ''[[The Christmas Wish (film)|The Christmas Wish]]'', played the supporting role of Giulia De Lezze in ''[[Dangerous Beauty]]'',<ref name=biochannel/> and provided some voice work for ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]''.<ref name="Talk Talk"/> She said in an interview in 2012, "That really should not be on my résumé!

Much of her early career is filled with near misses in casting, as she was up for significant roles in films such as 1997's ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'' and 2000's ''[[Meet the Parents]]'', which eventually went to other actresses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/newsmakers2/2006-Ra-Z/Watts-Naomi.html|title=Naomi Watts: Biography|work=Encyclopedia of World Biography|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=6 July 2011}}</ref> In an interview in 2012, Watts said, "I came to New York and auditioned at least five times for ''Meet the Parents''.

===2001–2002: Breakthrough with ''Mulholland Drive''===
[[File:Naomi Watts és David Lynch--.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Watts with filmmaker [[David Lynch]] at the 2001 [[Cannes Film Festival]]]]

In 1999, director [[David Lynch]] began casting for his psychological thriller ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''. He interviewed Watts after looking at her headshot,<ref name=dailybeast/> without having seen any of her previous work,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Twin Piques|first=Anna|last=David|date=November 2001|work=Premiere Magazine|publisher=Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.|pages=80–81|volume=15|issue=3}}</ref> and offered her the lead role.<ref name=dailybeast/> Lynch later said about his selection of Watts, "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package."<ref>{{cite journal|title=It's a Road She Knows Well; 'Mulholland Dr.' star Naomi Watts has lived the Hollywood metaphor behind the fabled highway|first=Scarlet|last=Cheng|date=12 October 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/12/entertainment/ca-56239|accessdate=7 July 2011|page=20}}</ref> Conceived as a pilot for a television series, Lynch shot a large portion of it in February 1999, planning to keep it open-ended for a potential series. However, the pilot was rejected. Watts recalled thinking at the time, "just my dumb luck, that I'm in the only David Lynch programme that never sees the light of day."<ref name=mymotto/> Instead, Lynch filmed an ending in October 2000, turning it into a feature film which was picked up for distribution.

The film, which also starred [[Laura Harring]] and [[Justin Theroux]], was highly acclaimed by critics and would become Watts' breakthrough.
