'''Elsa Benham''' (November 20, 1908 &ndash; April 20, 1995, [[Irving, Texas]]) was a dancer and [[silent movie]] performer from [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

Benham was discovered by [[film director]] [[James Cruze]] as a member of the Kosloff Ballet when she performed in [[Hollywood]] in 1924. Cruz signed her to a small part in a movie he was making. Her career progressed quickly as she secured roles in ''Dick Turpin'' (1925) with [[Tom Mix]] and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', which starred [[Mary Philbin]] and [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]].

In 1925 Benham won a popularity contest conducted by the [[West Hollywood]] Business Men's Association. It was entered by many film actresses. She was awarded a diamond ring for winning. Press reports compared her appearance to actress [[Barbara La Marr]], though Benham was many years younger. Benham was about 5'5" in height, with hazel eyes, and black hair.

Benham had a brief tenure as a Hollywood actress. Most of her screen credits are in western films. Some of the titles are ''Fighting With [[Buffalo Bill]]'' (1925), ''Speeding Hoofs'' (1927), and ''Code of the Cow Country'' (1927).
