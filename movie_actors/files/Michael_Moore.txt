==Career==
Moore dropped out of the [[University of Michigan–Flint]] following his first year (where he wrote for the student newspaper ''[[The Michigan Times]]''). At 22 he founded the alternative weekly magazine ''The Flint Voice'', which soon changed its name to ''The Michigan Voice'' as it expanded to cover the entire state. In 1986, when Moore became the editor of [[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'']], a liberal political magazine, he moved to California and ''The Michigan Voice'' was shut down.
[[File:Michael Moore 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra) color.jpg|thumb|Moore at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]] in September 2009]]
After four months at ''Mother Jones'', Moore was fired. [[Matt Labash]] of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' reported this was for refusing to print an article by [[Paul Berman]] that was critical of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] human rights record in Nicaragua.<ref name=Schultz>{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Emily|title=Michael Moore: a biorgraphy|year=2005|publisher=ECW Press|location=47–54|isbn=1-55022-699-1}}</ref> Moore refused to run the article, believing it to be inaccurate. "The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years."<ref>Cockburn, Alexander. "Beat The Devil: Michael meets Mr. Jones", ''[[The Nation]]'', September 13, 1986.</ref> Moore believes that ''Mother Jones'' fired him because of the publisher's refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of [[Flint, Michigan]]. He responded by putting laid-off GM worker [[Ben Hamper]] (who was also writing for the same magazine at the time) on the magazine's cover, leading to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, ''[[Roger & Me]].''<ref>Matt Labash. "Michael Moore, One-Trick Phony". ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''. June 8, 1998.</ref>

===Directing/producing===
; ''[[Roger & Me]]'': Moore first became famous for his [[Emmy Award]] winning 1989 film, ''Roger & Me'', a documentary about what happened to [[Flint, Michigan]], after [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] closed its factories and opened new ones in Mexico, where the workers were paid much less.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0601619/awards] ''Internet Movie Data Base'', Accessed July 20, 2012.</ref> Since then Moore has become known as a critic of the [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] view of [[globalization]]. "Roger" is [[Roger Smith (executive)|Roger B. Smith]], former CEO and president of General Motors. [[Harlan Jacobson]], editor of ''[[Film Comment]]'' magazine, said that Moore muddled the chronology in ''Roger & Me'' to make it seem that events that took place before G.M.’s layoffs were a consequence of them. Critic [[Roger Ebert]] defended Moore's handling of the timeline as an artistic and stylistic choice that had less to do with his credibility as a filmmaker and more to do with the flexibility of film as a medium to express a satiric viewpoint.<ref>{{cite news|title=Attacks on 'Roger & Me' completely miss the point of the film |first=Roger|last=Ebert|date =February 11, 1990|publisher=Sun Times|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900211/COMMENTARY/22010306|accessdate =October 5, 2011}}</ref>

; ''[[Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint]]'': (1992) is a short (23-minute) documentary film that was aired on PBS. It is based on ''Roger & Me''. The film's title refers to Rhonda Britton, a Flint, Michigan, resident featured in both the 1989 and 1992 films who sells rabbits as either pets or meat.<ref>{{cite news |title='Roger and Me' Revisited |author=Diane Katz |publisher=[[The Detroit News]] |date=September 20, 1992 |accessdate=March 8, 2011}}</ref>

; ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'': In 1995, Moore released a satirical film, ''Canadian Bacon'', which features a fictional US president (played by [[Alan Alda]]) engineering a fake war with Canada in order to boost his popularity. It is noted for containing a number of Canadian and American stereotypes, and for being Moore's only non-documentary film. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian-born actor [[John Candy]], and also features a number of cameos by other Canadian actors. In the film, several potential enemies for America's next great campaign are discussed by the president and his cabinet. (The scene was strongly influenced by the [[Stanley Kubrick]] film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]].'') The President comments that declaring war on Canada was as ridiculous as declaring war on international terrorism. His military adviser, played by [[Rip Torn]], quickly rebuffs this idea, saying that no one would care about "a bunch of guys driving around blowing up rent-a-cars."

; ''[[The Big One (film)|The Big One]]'': In 1997, Moore directed ''The Big One'', which documents the tour publicizing his book ''[[Downsize This!|Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American]]'', in which he criticizes mass layoffs despite record corporate profits. Among others, he targets [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] for outsourcing shoe production to [[Indonesia]].

; ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'': This 2002 film probes the culture of [[Gun violence in the United States|guns and violence in the United States]], taking as a starting point the [[Columbine High School massacre]] of 1999. ''Bowling for Columbine'' won the Anniversary Prize at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name="cannes-2002.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3137379/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Bowling for Columbine |accessdate=October 24, 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> and France's [[César Award]] as the Best Foreign Film. In the United States, it won the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award for Documentary Feature]]. It also enjoyed great commercial and critical success for a film of its type and became, at the time, the highest-grossing mainstream-released documentary (a record now held by Moore's ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'').<ref name=mojorank/> It was praised by some for illuminating a subject avoided by the mainstream media.

Moore later announced that ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' would not be in consideration for the 2005 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award for Documentary Feature]], but instead for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. He stated he wanted the movie to be seen by a few million more people via a television broadcast prior to election day. According to Moore, "Academy rules forbid the airing of a documentary on television within nine months of its theatrical release", and since the November 2 election was fewer than nine months after the film's release, it would have been disqualified for the Documentary Oscar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/why-i-will-not-seek-a-best-documentary-oscar-im-giving-it-up-in-the-hopes-more-voters-can-see-fahrenheit-911 |title=Why I Will Not Seek a Best Documentary Oscar (I'm giving it up in the hopes more voters can see "Fahrenheit 9/11") |author=Michael Moore |date=September 6, 2004 |accessdate=March 8, 2011}}</ref> However, Fahrenheit received no Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The title of the film alludes to the classic book ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' about a future totalitarian state in which books are banned; according to the book, paper begins to burn at {{convert|451|°F|°C}}. The pre-release subtitle of the film confirms the allusion: "The temperature at which freedom burns."

; ''[[Capitalism: A Love Story]]'': On September 23, 2009, Moore released a new movie titled ''Capitalism: A Love Story'', which looks at the [[late-2000s financial crisis]] and the U.S. economy during the transition between the incoming Obama Administration and the outgoing Bush Administration. Addressing a press conference at its release, Moore said, "Democracy is not a spectator sport, it's a participatory event. If we don't participate in it, it ceases to be a democracy. So Obama will rise or fall based not so much on what he does but on what we do to support him."<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE5850F320090906 "Capitalism is evil", says new Michael Moore film] [[Reuters]], September 6, 2009.</ref>

===Writing===
Moore has written and co-written eight non-fiction books, mostly on similar subject matter to his documentaries. ''[[Stupid White Men]]'' (2001) is ostensibly a critique of American domestic and foreign policy but, by Moore's own admission, is also "a book of political humor."<ref>[http://www.opinionjournal.com/forms/printThis.html?id=110003233 Opinion Journal from the Wall Street Journal:] Unmoored from Reality.

Several of his works have made bestseller lists.

===Acting===
Moore has dabbled in acting, following a supporting role in ''[[Lucky Numbers]]'' (2000) playing the cousin of [[Lisa Kudrow]]'s character, who agrees to be part of the scheme concocted by [[John Travolta]]'s character. He also had a cameo in his ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'' as an anti-Canada activist. In 2004, he did a cameo, as a news journalist, in ''[[The Fever (2004 film)|The Fever]]'', starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]] in the lead.

===Television===
Between 1994 and 1995, he directed and hosted the [[BBC]] television series ''[[TV Nation]]'', which followed the format of news magazine shows but covered topics they avoid. The series aired on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in the UK. The series was also aired in the US on [[NBC]] in 1994 for 9 episodes and again for 8 episodes on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1995.

His other major series was ''[[The Awful Truth (TV series)|The Awful Truth]]'', which satirized actions by big corporations and politicians. It aired on [[Channel 4]] in the UK, and the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] network in the US, in 1999 and 2000. Moore won the [[Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award]] in Arts and Entertainment for being the executive producer and host of ''The Awful Truth'', where he was also described as "muckraker, author and documentary filmmaker".

Another 1999 series, ''[[Michael Moore Live]]'', was aired in the UK only on [[Channel 4]], though it was broadcast from New York. This show had a similar format to ''The Awful Truth'', but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week.

===Music videos===
Moore has directed several music videos, including two for [[Rage Against the Machine]] for songs from ''[[The Battle of Los Angeles (album)|The Battle of Los Angeles]]'': "[[Sleep Now in the Fire]]" and "[[Testify (Rage Against the Machine song)|Testify]]". He was threatened with arrest during the shooting of "Sleep Now in the Fire", which was filmed on [[Wall Street]]; and subsequently the city of New York City had denied the band permission to play there, even though the band and Moore had secured a federal permit to perform.<ref>[http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2000/397/397p24c.htm Green Left Weekly:] Rage against Wall Street.

Moore also directed the videos for [[R.E.M.]] single "[[All the Way to Reno (You're Gonna Be a Star)]]" in 2001 and the [[System of a Down]] song "[[Steal This Album!|Boom!]]".

Although Moore has been noted for his political activism,<ref name=detnews /> he rejects being labeled as a "[[political activist]]" saying such a description is redundant as a citizen of a democracy: "I and you and everyone else has to be a political activist.

Moore was a high-profile guest at both the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] and the [[2004 Republican National Convention]], chronicling his impressions in ''[[USA Today]]''. He was criticized in a speech by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[John McCain]] as "a disingenuous film-maker." Moore laughed and waved as Republican attendees jeered, later chanting "four more years." Moore [[Loser (hand gesture)|gestured his thumb and finger]] at the crowd, which translates into "loser."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/mccain.moore/index.html ''Delegates relish McCain jab at filmmaker Moore''] CNN.com.

During September and October 2004, Moore spoke at universities and colleges in [[swing state]]s during his "Slacker Uprising Tour". The tour gave away [[ramen]] and underwear to students who promised to vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.10news.com/politics/3802561/detail.html |title=Moore Offers 'Hell raiser' Scholarship During Speech |work=10News.com |date=October 14, 2004 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0809/S00509.htm |title=Michael Moore Offers Slacker Uprising Free Online |work=Scoop Independent News |date=September 23, 2008 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}</ref> One stop during the tour was [[Utah Valley University|Utah Valley State College]].

Despite having supported [[Ralph Nader]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], Moore urged Nader not to run in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] so as not to split the left vote. On ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', Moore and Maher knelt before Nader to plead with him to stay out of the race.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33257-2004Aug1.html |title=Bill Maher: Back for More |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=August 2, 2004 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}</ref>

Moore drew attention in 2004 when he used the term "deserter" when he introduced Retired Army Gen. Wesley K. Clark at a Democratic Presidential debate in New Hampshire. Noting that Clark had been a champion debater at West Point, Moore told a laughing crowd, "I know what you're thinking. I want to see that debate" between Clark and [George W.] Bush – "the general versus the deserter." Moore said he was referring to published reports in several media outlets including ''The Boston Globe'' which had reported that "there is strong evidence that Bush performed no military service as required when he moved from Houston to Alabama to work on a U.S. Senate campaign from May to November 1972."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/george-w-bush-awol#article2 |title=George W.

In an op-ed piece for ''[[The New York Times]]'' published on December 31, 2013, Moore assessed the [[Affordable Care Act]], calling it “awful” and adding that, “Obamacare’s rocky start ... is a result of one fatal flaw: The Affordable Care Act is a pro-insurance-industry plan implemented by a president who knew in his heart that a single-payer, Medicare-for-all model was the true way to go.” Despite his strong critique, however, Moore wrote that he still considers the plan a “godsend” because it provides a start "to get what we deserve: universal quality health care.”<ref name="NYT-20131231">{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Michael |title=The Obamacare We Deserve |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/opinion/moore-the-obamacare-we-deserve.html |date=December 31, 2013 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=January 6, 2014 }}</ref><ref name="TNR-20140105">{{cite news|author=Noam Schieber|title=How Obamacare Actually Paves the Way Toward Single Payer|url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116105/obamacare-will-lead-single-payer-michael-moore|date=January 5, 2014 |work=[[The New Republic]]|accessdate=January 7, 2014}}</ref>

Following the [[Columbine High School massacre]], Moore acquired a lifetime membership to the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA).
