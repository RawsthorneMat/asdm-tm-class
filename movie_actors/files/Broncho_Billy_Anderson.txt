'''Gilbert M. "Broncho Billy" Anderson''' (March 21, 1880 – January 20, 1971) was an American actor, writer, film director, and film producer, who is best known as the first star of the [[Western (genre)|Western]] film genre.<ref name="obit">{{cite news |title=Bronco Billy Anderson is Dead at 88|work=[[New York Times]] |date=1971-01-21}}</ref>

==Early life==
Anderson was born '''Maxwell Henry Aronson''' in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], [[Arkansas]], the sixth child of Henry and Esther (Ash) Aronson, both natives of New York.<ref>[[:Image:1880 census Aronson.jpg|Aronson in the United States Federal Census]], [[Pulaski County, Arkansas]], 1880, Enumeration District 143, p. 303.</ref><ref>http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=534</ref><ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~celebrities/anderson.html</ref> His family was [[Jewish]], his father's parents having emigrated to the United States from [[Prussia]], and his mother's from the [[Russian Empire]].<ref name=erw>{{Cite news|last=Kehr|first=Dave|title=Sring Films / Actors-Directors; The Actors Who Have Two Faces|pages=|publisher=The New York Times|date=2000-01-16|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30E1FFB3D5E0C758DDDA80894D8404482|accessdate=2015-02-23}}</ref> He lived in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]] until he was 8, when he moved with his family to [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. When he was 18, he moved to [[New York City]] and appeared in [[vaudeville]] and the theater, supplementing his income as a photographer's model and newspaper vendor. In 1903, he met [[Edwin S. Porter]], who hired him as an actor and occasional script collaborator.<ref>Corneau, Ernest N. ''The Hall of Fame of Western Film Stars''.

==Film==
Anderson played three roles in Porter's early [[film|motion picture]] ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903). Seeing the film for the first time at a vaudeville theater and being overwhelmed by the audience's reaction, he decided to work in the film industry exclusively. He began to write, direct, and act in his own westerns under the name Gilbert M. Anderson.

In 1907, Anderson and [[George Kirke Spoor]] founded [[Essanay Studios]] ("S and A" for Spoor and Anderson), one of the major early [[movie studio]]s. Anderson acted in over 300 short films. He played a wide variety of characters, but he gained enormous popularity from a series of 148 [[silent film|silent]] western shorts and was the first film cowboy star, "Broncho Billy."<ref>{{cite book|author=Kiehn, David.|year=2003|title=Broncho Billy and the Essanay Film Company|publisher=Farwell Books|location=Berkeley, Calif|isbn=0-9729226-5-2}}, p. 162.</ref> Spoor stayed in Chicago running the company like a factory, while Anderson traveled the western United States by train with a film crew shooting movies.  Many of these were shot in [[Fremont, California#Niles|Niles]], a small town in [[Alameda County, California]], south-east of San Francisco, where the nearby [[Western Pacific Railroad]] route through [[Niles Canyon]] proved to be a very suitable location for the filming of Westerns.

Writing, acting, and directing most of these movies, Anderson also found time to direct a series of "Alkali Ike" comedy westerns starring [[Augustus Carney]]. In 1916, Anderson sold his ownership in Essanay and retired from acting. He returned to [[New York]], bought the [[Longacre Theatre]] and produced plays, but without permanent success. He then made a brief comeback as a producer with a series of shorts with [[Stan Laurel]], including his first work with [[Oliver Hardy]] in ''[[A Lucky Dog]]'' (filmed in 1919, released in 1921). Conflicts with the studio, Metro, led him to retire again after 1920.

Anderson sued [[Paramount Pictures]] for naming a character "Bronco Billy" in ''[[Star Spangled Rhythm]]'' (1943) and for depicting the character as a "washed-up and broken-down actor," which he felt reflected badly on him.  He asked for $900,000, but the outcome of the suit is unknown.<ref>{{tcmdb title|91295|Star Spangled Rhythm ("Notes")}}</ref>

Anderson resumed producing movies, as owner of Progressive Pictures, into the 1950s, then retired again. In 1958, he received an [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as a "motion picture pioneer" for his "contributions to the development of motion pictures as entertainment."

At age 85, Anderson came out of retirement for a cameo role in ''The Bounty Killer'' (1965). For the last years of his life, he lived at the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], California.<ref>Corneau, Ernest N.

==Death==
Anderson died in 1971 at the age of 90, at a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]] in [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]], [[California]].<ref>Los Angeles Times, January 21, 1971, Section 1, p. 2.</ref> He was survived by his wife, Mollie Louise (Schabbleman) Anderson, their daughter, Maxine, and his sister [[Leona Anderson]] (1884–1973). He was cremated and his ashes placed in a vault at the [[Chapel of the Pines Crematory]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

==Legacy==
Anderson was honored posthumously in 1998 with his image on a [[List of people on stamps of the United States|U.S. postage stamp]]. In 2002, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]. For the past nine years, [[Niles, California|Niles]] (now part of [[Fremont, California|Fremont]]), California, site of the western Essanay Studios, has held an annual "Broncho Billy Silent Film Festival."<ref>[http://www.nilesfilmmuseum.org/bb_festival.htm Broncho Billy Silent Film Festival]</ref>

Anderson has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1651 Vine Street in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]].<ref>[http://www.hollywoodchamber.net/ Hollywood Chamber of Commerce]</ref>

A Chicago Park District park, not far from the site of the Chicago Essanay Studio lot, was named Broncho Billy Park in his honor.<ref>[http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/Broncho-Billy-Playlot-Park/]</ref>
