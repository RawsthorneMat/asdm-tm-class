== Career ==
Hamilton's acting debut came first on television, followed by a major role as Lisa Rogers in the prime-time soap opera ''[[Secrets of Midland Heights]]'' (December 1980/January 1981).

Hamilton returned to the big screen in 1990 with [[Michael Caine]] in ''[[Mr. Destiny]]'' and in 1991 with ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', the sequel to ''The Terminator''.
