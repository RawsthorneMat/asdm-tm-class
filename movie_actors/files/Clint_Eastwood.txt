'''Clinton "Clint" Eastwood, Jr.''' (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, film director, producer, musician, and politician. He rose to international fame with his role as the [[Man with No Name]] in [[Sergio Leone]]'s [[Dollars Trilogy|''Dollars'' trilogy]] of [[spaghetti Western]]s during the 1960s, and as [[antihero]] cop [[Harry Callahan (character)|Harry Callahan]] in the five ''[[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]]'' films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made him an enduring [[cultural icon]] of [[masculinity]].<ref name="Fischer, Landy & Smith">Fischer, Landy & Smith, p. 43</ref><ref>Kitses, p. 307</ref>

For his work in the Western film ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992) and the sports drama ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (2004), Eastwood won Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and Producer of the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], as well as receiving nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. His greatest commercial successes have been the adventure comedy ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'' (1978) and its sequel, the action comedy ''[[Any Which Way You Can]]'' (1980), after adjustment for inflation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clint Eastwood Movie Box Office Results|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=clinteastwood.htm |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref> Other popular films include the Western ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'' (1968), the psychological thriller ''[[Play Misty for Me]]'' (1971), the crime film ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'' (1974), the Western ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), the prison film ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' (1979), the action film ''[[Firefox (film)|Firefox]]'' (1982), the suspense thriller ''[[Tightrope (film)|Tightrope]]'' (1984), the Western ''[[Pale Rider]]'' (1985), the war film ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'' (1986), the action thriller ''[[In the Line of Fire]]'' (1993), the romantic drama ''[[The Bridges of Madison County (film)|The Bridges of Madison County]]'' (1995), and the drama ''[[Gran Torino]]'' (2008).

In addition to directing many of his own [[star vehicle]]s, Eastwood has also directed films in which he did not appear, such as the mystery drama ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'' (2003) and the war film ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'' (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, and the drama ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'' (2008). The war drama biopic ''[[American Sniper (film)|American Sniper]]'' (2014) set box office records for the biggest January release ever and was also the biggest opening ever for an Eastwood film. He received considerable critical praise in France for several films, including some which were not well received in the United States.<!--which ones?--> He has been awarded two of France's highest honors: in 1994 he became a recipient of the [[Commandeur]] of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] and in 2007 he was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]] medal. In 2000, he was awarded the Italian [[Venice Film Festival]] [[Golden Lion]] for lifetime achievement.

Since 1967, Eastwood has run his own production company, [[Malpaso Productions|Malpaso]], which has produced all except four of his American films. He served as the nonpartisan mayor of [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]] from 1986 to 1988.

==Career==

===Early work===
[[File:Clint Eastwood-Rawhide publicity.JPG|thumb|upright|Publicity photo for  ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', 1961]]
According to the [[CBS]] press release for ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', [[Universal Studios]] (then known as Universal-International) was shooting in Fort Ord when an assistant noticed Eastwood and arranged for him to meet the series' director.<ref name="McG52">McGilligan, p. 52</ref> According to biographer [[Richard Schickel]], a man named Chuck Hill was instrumental in securing employment for Eastwood at Universal;<ref name="McG52"/> Hill, who had contacts in Hollywood, managed to sneak Eastwood into one of Universal's studios, where he showed him to cameraman [[Irving Glassberg]].<ref name="McG52"/> Glassberg arranged for Eastwood to have an audition with [[Arthur Lubin]] who, although impressed with Eastwood's appearance and {{convert|6|ft|4|in|adj=on}} frame,<ref>Baldwin, p. 61</ref> initially questioned his acting skills, remarking, "He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything".<ref name="McG60">McGilligan, p. 60</ref> Lubin suggested Eastwood attend drama classes, and arranged for his initial contract in April 1954 at $100 ({{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100|1954}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) per week.<ref name="McG60"/> After signing, Eastwood was criticized for his stiff manner, his squint, and for hissing his lines through his teeth, a feature that would become a lifelong trademark.<ref>McGilligan, p. 62</ref><ref name="CinemaInstitute1972">{{cite book|author1=University of Southern California.

Eastwood's acting debut was an uncredited bit part as a laboratory assistant in the 1955 film ''[[Revenge of the Creature]]''.<ref name="McG64">McGilligan, p. 64</ref> Over the next three years, he had uncredited bit parts in several other films including ''[[Lady Godiva of Coventry]]'', ''[[Never Say Goodbye (1956 film)|Never Say Goodbye]]'' and ''[[Escapade in Japan]]'', as well as a small speaking role in ''[[Francis in the Navy]]''.<ref>Fitzgerald & Magers, p. 264</ref><ref>McGilligan, p. 80</ref><ref name="McG81">McGilligan, p. 81</ref> In 1959, he made a guest appearance on ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', opposite [[James Garner]], as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money.<ref name="McG87">McGilligan, p. 87</ref> Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in the French picture ''[[Lafayette Escadrille (film)|Lafayette Escadrille]]'' and took on a featured role as an ex-Confederate renegade in ''[[Ambush at Cimarron Pass]]'', a film that Eastwood viewed as disastrous and the lowest point of his career.<ref name="McG93">McGilligan, p. 93</ref><ref>Frayling, p. 45</ref><ref>O'Brien, p. 40</ref>

===1960s===
{{Main|Clint Eastwood in the 1960s}}
In late 1963, Eastwood's co-star on ''Rawhide'', Eric Fleming, rejected an offer to star in an Italian-made western called ''A Fistful of Dollars'', to be directed in a remote region of Spain by the then relatively unknown [[Sergio Leone]].<ref name="McG126">McGilligan, p. 126</ref> Knowing that he could play a cowboy convincingly, [[Richard Harrison (actor)|Richard Harrison]] suggested Eastwood, who in turn saw the film as an opportunity to escape from his ''Rawhide'' image. He signed a contract for $15,000 ({{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|15000|1964}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in wages for eleven&nbsp;weeks' work, with a bonus of a [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] automobile upon completion.<ref name="Eliot59">Eliot, p. 59</ref><ref name="McG128">McGilligan, p. 128</ref> Eastwood later spoke of the transition from a television western to ''A Fistful of Dollars'': "In ''Rawhide'' I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I decided it was time to be an anti-hero."<ref>Hughes, p. 4</ref> Eastwood was instrumental in creating the [[Man with No Name]] character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the "mask" he was attempting to create for the loner character.<ref name="McG131">McGilligan, p. 131</ref>
[[File:Clint Eastwood - 1960s.JPG|thumb|left|Eastwood in ''A Fistful of Dollars'' (1964)]]
''A Fistful of Dollars'' proved a landmark in the development of [[spaghetti Western]]s, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous [[antihero]]. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy<ref>Mercer, p. 272</ref> and he was re-hired to star in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter [[Luciano Vincenzoni]], the rights to ''For a Few Dollars More'' and the final film of the trilogy (''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'') were sold to [[United Artists]] for about $900,000 ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|900000|1965|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name="McG148">McGilligan, p. 148</ref>

In January 1966, Eastwood met producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] in New York City and agreed to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production named ''[[Le Streghe]]'' ("The Witches") opposite De Laurentiis' wife, actress [[Silvana Mangano]].<ref name="McG150">McGilligan, p. 150</ref> Eastwood's nineteen-minute installment took only a few days to shoot, but his performance did not please the critics, one writing that "no other performance of his is quite so 'un-Clintlike'&nbsp;".<ref name="McG151">McGilligan, p. 151</ref> Two months later Eastwood began work on the third ''Dollars'' film, ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', again playing the mysterious Man with No Name. [[Lee Van Cleef]] returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with [[Eli Wallach]] portraying the cunning Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of [[Confederate gold]] buried in a cemetery. During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up, Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop. "I know about these things," he said. "Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can."<ref name="McG156">McGillagan, p. 156</ref> Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word "Vaya!" resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach.<ref name="McG156"/>
{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="I wanted to play it with an economy of words and create this whole feeling through attitude and movement. It was just the kind of character I had envisioned for a long time, keep to the mystery and allude to what happened in the past. It came about after the frustration of doing ''Rawhide'' for so long. I felt the less he said, the stronger he became and the more he grew in the imagination of the audience."|source=—Eastwood, on playing the Man with No Name character<ref>McGilligan, p. 133</ref>}}
The ''Dollars'' trilogy was not released in the United States until 1967, when ''A Fistful of Dollars'' opened in January, followed by ''For a Few Dollars More'' in May, and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' on December 29, 1967.<ref name="McG157">McGilligan, p. 157</ref> All the films were commercially successful, particularly ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', which eventually earned $8&nbsp;million ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|8000000|1967|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star.<ref name="McG157"/> All three films received bad reviews, and marked the beginning of a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics' respect.<ref name="McG158">McGilligan, p. 158</ref> [[Judith Crist]] described ''A Fistful of Dollars'' as "cheapjack",<ref>{{cite news|last=Crist|first=Judith|title=Plain Murder All the Way|work=[[New York World Journal Tribune]]|date=February 2, 1967}}</ref> while ''[[Newsweek]]'' considered ''For a Few Dollars More'' as "excruciatingly dopey".<ref name="McG158"/> [[Renata Adler]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' was "the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre".<ref>{{cite news|last=Adler|first=Renata|title=The Screen:Zane Grey Meets the Marquis de Sade|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50F16FE3D5C147493C7AB178AD85F4C8685F9|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 25, 1968|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine drew attention to the film's wooden acting, especially on the part of Eastwood, though a few critics such as [[Vincent Canby]] and [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''The New York Times'' praised Eastwood's coolness in playing the tall, lone stranger.<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|title=A Fistful of Dollars (1964)|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40910FC3F5D107B93C0A91789D85F438685F9&scp=1&sq=A+Fistful+of+Dollars&st=p|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 2, 1967|accessdate=January 9, 2011}}</ref> Leone's cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by critics who disparaged the acting in the film.<ref name="McG158"/>

Stardom brought more roles for Eastwood. He signed to star in the American revisionist western ''[[Hang 'Em High]]'' (1968), featured alongside [[Inger Stevens]], [[Pat Hingle]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Ed Begley]], [[Alan Hale, Jr.|Alan Hale]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Bruce Dern]], and [[James MacArthur]],<ref name="McG159">McGilligan, p. 159</ref> playing a man who takes up a Marshal's badge and seeks revenge as a lawman after being lynched by vigilantes and left for dead.<ref name="McG160">McGilligan, p. 160</ref> The film earned Eastwood a fee of $400,000 ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|400000|1968|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and 25&nbsp;percent of its net box-office takings.<ref name="McG159"/> Using money earned from the ''Dollars'' trilogy, accountant and Eastwood advisor Irving Leonard helped establish Eastwood's own production company, [[Malpaso Productions]], named after [[Malpaso Creek]] on Eastwood's property in [[Monterey County, California]]. Leonard arranged for ''Hang 'Em High'' to be a joint production with United Artists;<ref name="McG162">McGilligan, p. 162</ref> when it opened in July 1968, it had the most unprecedented opening weekend in United Artists' history. ''Hang 'Em High'' was widely praised by critics, including Archer Winsten of the ''[[New York Post]]'', who described it as, "a western of quality, courage, danger and excitement".<ref name="Zmi12"/>

Before the release of ''Hang 'Em High'', Eastwood had already begun working on ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'', about an Arizona deputy sheriff tracking a wanted psychopathic criminal ([[Don Stroud]]) through the streets of New York City. He was reunited with Universal Studios for it after receiving an offer of $1&nbsp;million ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|1000000|1967|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}})—more than double his previous salary.<ref name="McG165">McGilligan, p. 165</ref> [[Jennings Lang]] arranged for Eastwood to meet [[Don Siegel]], a Universal contract director who later became Eastwood's close friend, forming a partnership that would last more than ten years and produce five films.<ref name="McG167">McGilligan, p. 167</ref> Shooting began in November 1967, before the script had been finalized.<ref name="McG169">McGilligan, p. 169</ref> The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence.<ref>Lloyd and Robinson, p. 417</ref><ref>Slocum, p. 205</ref> ''Coogan's Bluff'' also became the first collaboration with Argentine composer [[Lalo Schifrin]], who would later compose the jazzy score to several Eastwood films in the 1970s and 1980s, including the ''Dirty Harry'' films.

Eastwood was paid $750,000 ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|750000|1968|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in 1968 for the war epic ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'',<ref name="McG172">McGilligan, p. 172</ref> about a World War II squad parachuting into a [[Gestapo]] stronghold in the alpine mountains. [[Richard Burton]] played the squad's commander, with Eastwood as his right-hand man. Eastwood was also cast as [[Two-Face]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'']] television show, but the series was canceled before filming began.<ref name="Eliot83">Eliot, p. 83</ref>

Eastwood then branched out to star in the only [[musical film|musical]] of his career, ''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1969). Eastwood and [[Lee Marvin]] play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler's less favored wife ([[Jean Seberg]]) at an auction.

===1970s===

In 1970, Eastwood starred with [[Shirley MacLaine]] in the western ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'', directed by [[Don Siegel]].

Following [[Sean Connery]]'s announcement that he would not play [[James Bond]] again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor.<ref>{{cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title=Clint Eastwood as Superman or James Bond?

In 1973, Eastwood directed his first western, ''[[High Plains Drifter]]'', in which he also starred. The film had a moral and supernatural theme, later emulated in ''Pale Rider''. The plot follows a mysterious stranger (Eastwood) who arrives in a brooding Western town where the people hire him to protect them against three soon-to-be-released felons. There remains confusion during the film as to whether the stranger is the brother of the deputy, whom the felons lynched and murdered, or his ghost. Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and [[allegory]], influenced by Leone.<ref name="McG221">McGilligan, p. 221</ref> The revisionist film received a mixed reception, but was a major box office success. A number of critics thought Eastwood's directing was "as derivative as it was expressive", with [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] of the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' remarking that Eastwood had "absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society".<ref name="McG223">McGilligan, p. 223</ref> [[John Wayne]], who had declined a role in the film, sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the film's release in which he complained that, "the townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer, the spirit that made America great".<ref>Schickel, p. 291</ref>

[[File:Clint Eastwood-Holden-Breezy.jpg|thumb|left|Eastwood directing [[William Holden]] in ''Breezy'' (1973)]]
Eastwood next turned his attention towards ''[[Breezy]]'' (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met [[Sondra Locke]] for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films over the next ten years and would become an important figure in his life.<ref name="McG229">McGilligan, p. 229</ref> [[Kay Lenz]] got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was considered too old. <!-- by whom?? -->The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and [[Frank Stanley (cinematographer)|Frank Stanley]], came in $1&nbsp;million ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|1000000|1973|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule.<ref name="McG230">McGilligan, p. 230</ref> ''Breezy'' was not a major critical or commercial success and it was only made available on video in 1998.<ref name="McG231">McGilligan, p. 231</ref>

Once filming of ''Breezy'' had finished, Warners announced that Eastwood had agreed to reprise his role as Callahan in ''[[Magnum Force]]'' (1973), a sequel to ''Dirty Harry'', about a group of rogue young officers (among them [[David Soul]], [[Robert Urich]] and [[Tim Matheson]]) in the San Francisco Police Department who systematically exterminate the city's worst criminals.<ref name="McG233">McGilligan, p. 233</ref> Although the film was a major success after release, grossing $58.1&nbsp;million ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|58100000|1973|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) in the United States (a record for Eastwood), it was not a critical success.<ref name="Eliot153">Eliot, p. 153</ref><ref name="McG236">McGilligan, p. 236</ref> ''The New York Times'' critic [[Nora Sayre]] panned the often contradictory moral themes of the film, while the paper's [[Frank Rich]] called it "the same old stuff".<ref name="McG236"/>

In 1974, Eastwood teamed up with [[Jeff Bridges]] and [[George Kennedy]] in the buddy action caper ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'', a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high suspense and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4&nbsp;million ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|32400000|1974|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).<ref name="McG241">McGilligan, p. 241</ref> Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

Eastwood's next film ''[[The Eiger Sanction (film)|The Eiger Sanction]]'' (1975) was based on [[Trevanian]]'s [[The Eiger Sanction|critically acclaimed spy novel]] of the same name. Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for [[Paul Newman]], an assassin turned college art professor who decides to return to his former profession for one last "sanction" in return for a rare [[Pissarro]] painting. In the process he must climb the north face of the [[Eiger]] in Switzerland under perilous conditions. Once again Eastwood starred alongside George Kennedy. [[Mike Hoover]] taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at [[Yosemite]] in the summer of 1974 before filming commenced in [[Grindelwald]] on August 12, 1974.<ref>Schickel, p. 314</ref><ref name="McG244">McGilligan, p. 244</ref> Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger the film crew suffered a number of accidents, including one fatality.<ref>Schickel, p. 315</ref><ref>Zmijewsky, p. 176</ref> Despite the danger, Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts. Upon release in May 1975 ''The Eiger Sanction'' was a commercial failure, receiving only $23.8&nbsp;million ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|23800000|1975|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) at the box office, and was poorly received by most critics.<ref name="McG253">McGilligan, p. 253</ref> Joy Gould Boyum of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' dismissed the film as "brutal fantasy".<ref name="McG253"/><ref>Schickel, p. 316</ref> Eastwood blamed [[Universal Studios]] for the film's poor promotion and turned his back on them to make an agreement with [[Warner Brothers]], through [[Frank Wells]], that has lasted to the present day.<ref name="McG256">McGilligan, p. 256</ref>

''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), a western inspired by [[Asa Carter]]'s 1972&nbsp;novel of the same name,<ref name="McG257">McGilligan, p. 257</ref> has lead character Josey Wales (Eastwood) as a pro-Confederate guerilla who refuses to surrender his arms after the [[American Civil War]] and is chased across the old southwest by a group of enforcers. Eastwood's costars were Locke (for the first time) and [[Chief Dan George]]. Director [[Philip Kaufman]] was fired by producer Bob Daley under Eastwood's command, resulting in a fine reported to be around $60,000 ({{Formatnum:{{Inflation|US|60000|1976}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from the [[Directors Guild of America]]—who subsequently passed new legislation reserving the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging and replacing a director.<ref name="McG264">McGilligan, p. 264</ref> The film was pre-screened at the [[Sun Valley, Idaho|Sun Valley]] Center for the Arts and Humanities in [[Idaho]] during a six-day conference entitled ''Western Movies: Myths and Images''.

Eastwood was then offered the role of [[Benjamin L.

The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer ([[Tyne Daly]]) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. The film, culminating in a shootout on [[Alcatraz]] island, was considerably shorter than the previous ''Dirty Harry'' films at 95&nbsp;minutes,<ref name="McG273">McGilligan, p. 273</ref> but was a major commercial success grossing $100&nbsp;million ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000000|1976|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) worldwide to become Eastwood's highest-grossing film to date.<ref name="McG278">McGilligan, p. 278</ref>

In 1977, he directed and starred in ''[[The Gauntlet (film)|The Gauntlet]]'' opposite Locke, [[Pat Hingle]], [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]], [[Bill McKinney]], and [[Mara Corday]]. Eastwood portrays a down-and-out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the [[mafia]]. Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics had mixed feelings about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Ebert, in contrast, gave the film three stars and called it "...&nbsp;classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny."<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19770101/REVIEWS/701010304/1023|title=The Gauntlet|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=January 1, 1977|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uuCeuD0o|archivedate=December 11, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> The following year, he starred in ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way But Loose]]'' in an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role. He played Philo Beddoe, a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love (Locke) accompanied by his brother (played by [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]]) and an [[orangutan]] called Clyde. The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood's most commercially successful film up to that time. Panned by critics, it ranked high among the box office successes of his career and was the second-highest grossing film of 1978.<ref name="McG302">McGilligan, p. 302</ref>

Eastwood starred in ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' in 1979, the last of his films to be directed by Siegel. It was based on the true story of [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Lee Morris]] who, along with [[John Anglin|John]] and [[Clarence Anglin]], escaped from the notorious [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary]] in 1962. The film was a major success; [[Stanley Kauffmann]] of ''[[The New Republic]]'' praised it as "crystalline cinema"<ref>McGilligan, p. 307</ref> and [[Frank Rich]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described it as "cool, cinematic grace".<ref>Zmijewsky, p. 213</ref>

In 1982, Eastwood directed and starred in ''[[Honkytonk Man]]'', based on the eponymous [[Clancy Carlile]]'s [[Great Depression|depression-era]] novel. Eastwood portrays a struggling western singer Red Stovall who suffers from [[tuberculosis]], but has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. He is accompanied by his young nephew (played by real-life son [[Kyle Eastwood|Kyle]]) to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he is supposed to record a song.

This was his first collaboration with [[Steven Spielberg]], who later co-produced ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'' and ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Halbfinger|first=David M.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/movies/21flag.html|title=The Power of an Image Drives Film by Eastwood|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 21, 2006|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uuiqkSBy|archivedate=December 11, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> He would revisit the Western genre when he directed and starred in ''[[Pale Rider]]'' (1985), a film based on the classic 1953&nbsp;western ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' and follows a preacher descending from the mists of the Sierras to side with the miners during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1850.<ref>McGilligan, p. 371</ref> The title is a reference to the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], as the rider of the pale horse is Death, and shows similarities to Eastwood's 1973&nbsp;western ''High Plains Drifter'' in its themes of morality and justice as well as its exploration of the supernatural.<ref>McGilligan, p. 375</ref> ''Pale Rider'' became one of Eastwood's most successful films to date. It was hailed as one of the best films of 1985 and the best western to appear for a considerable period, with [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' remarking, "This year (1985) will go down in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist".<ref>McGilligan, p. 378</ref>

In 1986, Eastwood co-starred with [[Marsha Mason]] in the military drama ''[[Heartbreak Ridge]]'', about the 1983&nbsp;United States [[invasion of Grenada]]. He portrays an aging [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marine]] [[Gunnery Sergeant]] and [[Korean War]] veteran. Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long-time friend and producer Fritz Manes, as well as between Eastwood and the [[United States Department of Defense]] who expressed contempt for the film.<ref name="McG398">McGilligan, p. 398</ref><ref>McGilligan, p. 406</ref> At the time the film was a commercial rather than a critical success, and has only come to be viewed more favorably in recent times.<ref>Schickel, p. 421</ref> The film grossed $70&nbsp;million ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|70000000|1986|r=2}}}}) domestically.<ref>McGilligan, p. 407</ref>

Eastwood starred in ''[[The Dead Pool]]'' (1988), the fifth and final film in the ''Dirty Harry'' series. It co-starred [[Patricia Clarkson]], [[Liam Neeson]], and a young [[Jim Carrey]] who plays Johnny Squares, a drug-addled rock star and the first of the victims on a list of celebrities drawn up by horror film director Peter Swan (Neeson) who are deemed most likely to die, the so-called "Dead Pool". The list is stolen by an obsessed fan who, in mimicking his favorite director, makes his way through the list killing off celebrities, of which Dirty Harry is also included. ''The Dead Pool'' grossed nearly $38&nbsp;million ({{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|38000000|1988|r=2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars), relatively low receipts for a ''Dirty Harry'' film and it is generally viewed as the weakest film of the series, although Roger Ebert perceived it to be as good as the original.<ref name="The Film journal">{{cite book|title=The Film journal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hAnsAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=May 1, 2011|date=July 1, 1988|publisher=Pubsun Corp.|page=24}}</ref><ref name="Ebert1992">{{cite book|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Roger Ebert's movie home companion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lTshz3206kYC|accessdate=May 1, 2011|year=1992|publisher=Andrews and McMeel|isbn=978-0-8362-6243-8}}</ref>

Eastwood began working on smaller, more personal projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. Always interested in jazz, he directed ''[[Bird (film)|Bird]]'' (1988), a biopic starring [[Forest Whitaker]] as jazz musician [[Charlie Parker|Charlie "Bird" Parker]]. Alto saxophonist [[Jackie McLean]] and [[Spike Lee]], son of jazz bassist [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]] and a long time critic of Eastwood, criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking that it did not capture his true essence and sense of humor.<ref name="McG433">McGilligan, p. 433</ref> Eastwood received two [[Golden Globes]] for the film, the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for his lifelong contribution, and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director award]]. However, ''Bird'' was a commercial failure, earning just $11&nbsp;million, which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people.<ref>Schickel, p. 435</ref> Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly received comedy ''[[Pink Cadillac (film)|Pink Cadillac]]'' (1989). The film is about a [[bounty hunter]] and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman ([[Bernadette Peters]]) who tries to outrun everyone in her husband's prized pink [[Cadillac]]. The film failed both critically and commercially,<ref>Schickel, p. 442</ref> earning barely more than ''Bird'' and marking a low point in Eastwood's career.<ref>McGilligan, p. 437</ref>

===1990s===

In 1992, Eastwood revisited the western genre in the self-directed film ''[[Unforgiven]]'', in which he played an aging ex-[[gunfighting|gunfighter]] long past his prime. Scripts existed for the film as early as 1976 under titles such as ''The Cut-Whore Killings'' and ''The William Munny Killings'' but Eastwood delayed the project because he wanted to wait until he was old enough to play his character and to savor it as the last of his western films.<ref name="McG467"/> ''Unforgiven'' was a major commercial and critical success; Jack Methews of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described it as "the finest classical western to come along since perhaps [[John Ford]]'s 1956 ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''.<ref name="McG473">McGilligan, p. 473</ref> The film was nominated for nine [[Academy Award]]s,<ref>McGilligan, p. 475</ref> (including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Eastwood and Best Original Screenplay for [[David Webb Peoples]]) and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Eastwood.

===Directing===
Beginning with the thriller ''[[Play Misty for Me]]'', Eastwood has directed over 30 films, including Westerns, action films, and dramas. He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that, unlike Eastwood,<ref name="denby20100308">{{cite news | url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/03/08/100308fa_fact_denby?currentPage=all | title=Out of the West | work=The New Yorker | date=March 8, 2010 | accessdate=September 1, 2012 | author=Denby, David}}</ref>{{quote|[[John Ford]] appeared in just a few [[silent film]]s; [[Howard Hawks]] never acted in movies. [[Clark Gable]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[James Stewart]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[William Holden]], [[Steve McQueen]], and [[Sean Connery]] never directed a feature. John Wayne directed only twice, and badly; ditto [[Burt Lancaster]]. [[Paul Newman]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Robert De Niro]], and [[Sean Penn]] have directed a few movies each, with mixed commercial and artistic success.}}

From the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and to keep budgets under control. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers most scenes to be completed on the first take;<ref>Munn, p. 160</ref><ref name="Biskind19697">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 196–197 (interviewer Peter Biskind)</ref> Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of [[Woody Allen]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and the [[Coen brothers]]. When acting in others' films he sometimes takes over directing, such as for ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'', if he believes production is too slow.{{r|denby20100308}} In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses [[storyboard]]s for developing the layout of a shooting schedule.<ref name="Gentry65">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 65 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref><ref name="Abb173">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 173 (interviewer Denise Abbott)</ref><ref name="Pascal235">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 235 (interviewer Pascal Mérigeau)</ref> He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film,<ref name="Intp678">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 67–68 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref> considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers.<ref name="Intp678"/><ref name="Intp91">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 91 (interviewer David Thomson)</ref> Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film's plot to provide the audience with necessary details, but not "so much that it insults their intelligence."<ref name="Intp60">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 60 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref>

According to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, "Eastwood's style is to shoot first and act afterward. He etches his characters virtually without words. He has developed the art of underplaying to the point that anyone around him who so much as flinches looks hammily histrionic."<ref name="Inc1971">{{cite book|last=Fayard|first=Judy|work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|title=Who can stand 32,580 seconds of Clint Eastwood?|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OEAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA44|accessdate=March 8, 2011|date=July 23, 1971|page=46|issn=00243019}}</ref> Interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter note that Eastwood's films are "superbly paced: unhurried; cool; and [give] a strong sense of real time, regardless of the speed of the narrative"<ref name="Intp45">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 45 (interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter)</ref> while Ric Gentry considers Eastwood's pacing to be "unrushed and relaxed".<ref name="Intp71">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 71 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref> Eastwood is fond of low-key lighting and back-lighting to give his movies a [[Film noir|"noir-ish"]] feel.<ref name="Biskind19697"/><ref name="Milan143">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 143 (interviewer Milan Pavolić)</ref>

Eastwood's frequent exploration of ethical values has drawn the attention of scholars, who have explored Eastwood's work from ethical and theological perspectives, including his portrayal of justice, mercy, suicide and the angel of death.<ref>Sara Anson Vaux, ''The Ethical Vision of Clint Eastwood'' (Wm.

Eastwood registered as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to vote for [[Dwight D.

Despite being heavily associated with firearms in his Westerns and cop movies, Eastwood has publicly endorsed gun control since at least 1973. In the April 24, 1973, edition of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the star stated that "I'm for gun legislation myself. I don't hunt."<ref>Tom Shales, "Eastwood's Star: Risen", ''[[Washington Post]]'', April 24, 1973.</ref> Two years later, in 1975, Eastwood told ''People'' magazine that he favors "gun control to some degree".<ref>Faber, Nancy, "Off the Screen: Clint Eastwood Outgrew Pasta Westerns, but is still in the Big Dough", ''People'', June 2, 1975, p. 22.</ref> About a year later, Eastwood remarked that "All guns should be registered. I don't think legitimate gun owners would mind that kind of legislation. Right now the furor against a gun law is by gun owners who are overreacting. They're worried that all guns are going to be recalled. It's impossible to take guns out of circulation, and that's why firearms should be registered and mail-order delivery of guns halted."<ref>Boris Zmijewsky and Lee Pfeiffer, ''The Films of Clint Eastwood''.

[[Larry King]], the television host and newspaper columnist, wrote in the May 22, 1995, edition of ''[[USA Today]]'' that "My interview with Eastwood will air on 'Larry King Weekend'&nbsp;... I asked him his thoughts on the NRA and gun control and he said that while people think of him as pro-gun, he has always been in favor of controls.

In August 2010, Eastwood wrote to the British [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]], to protest the decision to close the [[UK Film Council]], warning the closure could result in fewer foreign production companies choosing to work in Great Britain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-10911948|title=Clint Eastwood writes plea to save UK Film Council|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=August 9, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vxrz1mNV|archivedate=January 23, 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref>

In January 2011, Eastwood told the UK's ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that "I loved the fact that Obama is multi-racial. I thought that was terrific, as my wife is the same racial make-up. But I felt he was a greenhorn, and it turned out he didn't have experience in decision-making."  As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff."<ref name=DlyMail1347108/> On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]], suggesting that Romney would boost the country and "restore a decent tax system&nbsp;... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [to] who's paying taxes and who isn't."<ref>{{cite news|title=Clint Eastwood Endorses Mitt Romney in Presidential Race|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/04/clint-eastwood-endorses-mitt-romney|accessdate=August 4, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 4, 2012|agency=Associated Press|location=London}}</ref> During a speech at the [[2012 Republican National Convention]], Eastwood [[Clint Eastwood at the 2012 Republican National Convention|talked to an empty chair]] as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it.<ref>{{cite news|last=McNamara|first=Mary|title=Clint Eastwood and his imaginary non-friend at the convention|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-critics-notebook-republican-national-convention-20120831,0,7934066.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 31, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Abdullah|first=Halimah|title=Eastwood, the empty chair and the speech everyone's talking about|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/31/politics/eastwood-speech/index.html|newspaper=CNN|date=August 31, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Weiner|first=Rachel|title=Clint Eastwood talks to invisible Obama|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/08/30/clint-eastwood-talks-to-imaginary-obama|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=August 30, 2012}}</ref> The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. "My only message was [that] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked." I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's the way to do it in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values."<ref>{{cite news|last=Yamato|first=Jen|title=Clint Eastwood Says He'd 'Say Something Else' If He Could Have RNC Re-Do|url=http://movieline.com/2012/09/14/clint-eastwood-republican-national-convention-invisible-president-obama-chair/|newspaper=Movieline|date=September 14, 2012}}</ref>

Due to his speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, some see him as a warmonger or right-wing poster boy. However, Eastwood said he has always opposed war, and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further explained his anti-war stance by saying "I was a child growing up during World War II. That was supposed to be the one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, and it goes on and on forever . . . I just wonder . . . does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie ''[[American Sniper]]'' was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a Pro-War on Terror, Pro-Republican and a patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying it was a "stupid analysis" and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties.<ref>{{cite news|last=Howell|first=Peter|title=Think before you shoot, Clint Eastwood says of war: interview|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2015/01/13/think_before_you_shoot_clint_eastwood_says_of_war_interview.html|newspaper=The Star|date=January 16, 2015}}</ref> Eastwood responded to critics of ''American Sniper'' by saying his film was "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make" and that "the fact of what [war] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did"

==Music==
Eastwood favors [[jazz]] (especially [[bebop]]), [[blues]], classic [[rhythm and blues]], classical, and country-and-western music; his favorite musicians include saxophonists [[Charlie Parker]] and [[Lester Young]], pianists [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Dave Brubeck]], and [[Fats Waller]], and [[Delta blues]]man [[Robert Johnson]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Tosches |first=Nick |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/12/eastwood200812 |title=Nick Tosches on Clint Eastwood |publisher=Vanity Fair |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref> He is also a pianist and composer.<ref name="McG114">McGilligan, p. 114</ref> Jazz has played an important role in Eastwood's life from a young age and, although he never made it as a professional musician, he passed on the influence to his son Kyle Eastwood, a successful jazz bassist and composer. Eastwood developed as a boogie-woogie pianist early on and had originally intended to pursue a career in music by studying for a music theory degree after graduating from high school. In late 1959 he produced the album ''Cowboy Favorites'', released on the Cameo label.<ref name="McG114"/>
