'''Jo Morrow''' (born November 1, 1939 in [[Cuero, Texas]] as Beverly Jo Morrow<ref name="Glamour">[http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/202/Jo+Morrow/index.html Glamour Girls of the silver screen: Jo Morrow biography] Retrieved 2011-09-22</ref>), is an American film actress.  Through a "Be a Star" contest she won a film contract with [[20th Century Fox]] (with [[Gary Cooper]] in ''[[Ten North Frederick]]'') in 1958.<ref name="IMDb bio">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607507/bio IMDb Jo Marrow bio] Retrieved 2011-09-22</ref> After only one film with 20th Century-Fox she moved to [[Columbia Pictures]], allegedly because a producer at 20th Century Fox tried to make a pass at her.<ref name="Glamour"/>

At Columbia she made some ten films and a dozen TV series episodes between 1958 and 1963, the most notable being ''[[Our Man in Havana]]'', in which she played [[Alec Guinness]]' daughter Milly.<ref name="IMDb Filmography">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607507/filmoyear IMDb: Jo Morrow filmography] Retrieved 2011-09-22</ref>

In 1963 she married Jack Barnett, songwriter for [[Jimmy Durante]].<ref name="Glamour"/> The 1964 birth of a deaf daughter<ref name="Glamour"/> forced her to give up movies for motherhood. She had a brief comeback in a few exploitation films and TV series episodes in the 1970s.<ref name="IMDb bio"/><ref name="IMDb Filmography"/>
