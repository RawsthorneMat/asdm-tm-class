She belongs to a generation of Italian filmmakers from [[Emilia-Romagna]] that came into prominence in the 1970s, including [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] and [[Marco Bellocchio]]. Cavani became internationally known after the success of her 1974 feature film ''Il portiere di notte'' (''[[The Night Porter]]''). Her films are intellectual and have historical concerns.<ref name="Bruneta 227">Brunetta, ''The History of Italian Cinema'', p. 227</ref> In addition to feature films and documentaries, she has been an opera director.

== Early life ==
Cavani was born into a working-class family in [[Carpi, Emilia-Romagna|Carpi]], near [[Modena]] in the province of [[Emilia-Romagna]].<ref name="Marrone 3">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 3</ref> Cavani's father, an architect from [[Mantua]], belonged to a conservative bourgeois family of landowners. "My father was an architect interested in urban development. He took me to museums. He had worked in urban planning in [[Baghdad]] in 1956, when [[Iraq]] was still under British control. My mother was very strong, very capable, and very sweet", Cavani explained in an interview. Her mother was passionate about films and took her to the movies every Sunday from an early age. On her mother's side, Cavani came from a working-class family of militant antifascists. Her maternal grandfather, a syndicalist, introduced her to the works of [[Engels]], [[Marx]] and [[Bakunin]].<ref name="Marrone 4">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 4</ref>

She graduated in literature and philology at [[Bologna University]] in 1960, writing a dissertation on the fifteenth-century poet and nobleman Marsilio Pio.<ref name="Marrone 3" /> Cavani had intended to become an archeologist, a profession she soon abandoned in order to pursue her passion for the moving image.<ref name="Marrone 4" /> She attended [[Rome]]'s renowned "Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia", (Experimental Cinematography Center) inaugurated by [[Benito Mussolini]] prior to [[World War II]]. She studied documentary filmmaking and obtained her diploma with the short films ''Incontro notturno'' (1961), about the friendship between two men, a white man and a [[Senegal]]ese, and ''L'evento'' (1962) about a group of tourists who killed for fun. {{Clarify|date=November 2011}}

== Film career and later life ==

=== Early films (1961–1965) ===
While attending film school, Cavani won a competition at [[RAI]], Italy's national television network, and took a job there as a director of historical documentaries in 1961. Her professional career thus began making documentaries for RAI between 1961 and 1965, which included ''Storia del III Reich'', (History of the Third Reich) (1962–1963), which chronicles the rise of the Nazi regime.<ref name=" Marrone 5">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 5</ref> It was the first historical investigation of German totalitarianism to appear on television. Other documentaries are: ''L'età di Stalin'' ("The Stalin Years"), an investigation into the Soviet leader's years; ''La donna nella Resistenza'' (1965); ''Philippe Pétain, processo a Vichy'', winner of the [[Golden Lion]] at [[Venice film festival]] in 1965 in the documentary section. In this period she also made ''Il giorno della pace'', a four-hour documentary on immigration south-to-north within Italy.

=== ''Francesco d'Assisi'' (1966) ===
Cavani made her first full-length feature film in 1966 with ''Francis of Assisi'' ''(Francesco d'Assisi)''. Made for television and aired in two parts, it was deeply influenced by the style of [[Rossellini]] and the atmosphere typical of the films of [[Pasolini]]. Made in a period of political unrest; it was to become a kind of manifesto of dissenting Catholicism. Starring [[Lou Castel]], it portrays [[Francis of Assisi]] as a slightly depress protestor and an avid, albeit mad, supporter of armed brother hood. The ideal defender of the 1968 student movement. The film was a great success, but also triggered many negative reactions. It was called " heretical, blasphemous and offensive for the faith of the Italian people".<ref name="Marrone 18">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 18</ref> It was the first of many polemical reaction to Cavani's work.<ref name=" Bondanella 348">Bondanella, ''Italian Cinema'', p. 348</ref>

=== ''Galileo'' (1968) ===
Her next film, ''[[Galileo (1968 film)|Galileo]]'' (1968), focuses on the seventeenth-century conflict between science and religion.<ref name = " Marrone 37">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 37</ref> [[Galileo Galilei]]'s belief that the truth should be proved by experimental methods, makes him clash with the dogmas of the church and he falls into the hands of the [[Inquisition]]. The film, originally made for television, was banned by the Italian censor, that considered it anticlerical and was never aired, but it found a distributor and was released in theaters.<ref name=" Bondanella 348" />

=== ''The Cannibals'' (1969) ===
''[[I cannibali|The Cannibals]]'' ''(I Cannibali)'' (1969), Cavani's first film to rely on an independent production company, uses the myth of Antigone to present the contemporary political state of Italy.<ref name = " Marrone 57">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 57</ref> Inspired by [[Sophocles]]' [[Antigone]], the film, set in the industrial city of [[Milan]], recounts the struggle of a girl against the authorities that prevents burying the bodies of rebels killed by the police, to serve as a warning to its citizens. The brave girl, the only rebel in a city crushed by dictatorship, is aided by a mysterious man who speaks an unknown language. The example of this two youngsters is soon followed by others. This work was not very well received by the public, so Cavani returned to television with the series of documentaries ''I bambini e noi'' (1970).<ref name="Bondanella 349">Bondanella, ''Italian Cinema'', p. 349</ref>

=== ''The Guest'' (1971) ===
Cavani's subsequent film ''[[L’ospite]]'' ''(The Guest)''(1971), furthered her interest in social and psychological themes. The plot centers on the relationship between a writer and a woman, a former mental asylum patient struggling to fit back in society. The film, starring [[Lucia Bosè]], was made on a shoestring budget. It was shown at the [[Venice film festival]] out of competition.

=== ''Milarepa'' (1973) ===
The director undertook a venture into Oriental mystical experiences with ''[[Milarepa (1974 film)|Milarepa]]'' (1973). A story inspired in a classic text of Tibetan literature, Milarepa moves back and for in time between the story of the title character, a mystic of the eleventh century and a young westerner whose travails are not very different, both are torn between the search for knowledge and a quest for power. The film was praised by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] who called it a "truly beautiful film".<ref name=" Marrone 173">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 173</ref>

=== ''The Night Porter'' (1974) ===
Liliana Cavani was not well known beyond Italy until she made the 1974 film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (''Il portiere di notte''), which remains the film for which she is best-remembered.<ref name="Armstrong 85">Armstrong et al., ''The Rough Guide to Film'', p. 85</ref> The plot, set in [[Vienna]] in 1957, follows a former concentration camp victim, raped and tortured by an SS camp guard. Fifteen years later, she revives the pattern of abuse after encountering the man by chance in a hotel, where he is working under an assumed name as a night porter.<ref name="Bondanella 349" /> A deeply controversial film, it starred [[Charlotte Rampling]] and [[Dirk Bogarde]]. American critic [[Roger Ebert]] called it "despicable", and both major New York critics, [[Pauline Kael]] (''[[The New Yorker]]'') and [[Vincent Canby]] (''[[The New York Times]]'') dismissed it as "junk".<ref name="Marrone 221">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 221</ref> However, in [[Europe]], the film was uniformly hailed as a groundbreaking attempt to probe the unsettling sexual and psychological ambiguities generated by war.<ref name="Bondanella 351">Bondanella, ''Italian Cinema'', p. 351</ref>

=== ''Beyond Good and Evil'' (1977) ===
In 1977 she made ''[[Beyond Good and Evil (film)|Beyond Good and Evil]]'' (''Al di là del bene e del male''), which recounts the intense relationship between German philosophizer [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], his friend author [[Paul Rée]] and Russian writer and feminist [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]].<ref name="Marrone 116">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 116</ref> They meet in Rome in 1882 and move to [[Germany]] in a failed ménage à trois while attempting to live their lives and satisfy their intellectual needs rejecting the notions of bourgeois morality. Nietzsche goes mad from a venereal disease and Paul discovers his repressed homosexuality with tragic consequences. Lou, the most liberated of the three, following the banner of feminism, is the only survivor. The film, starring [[Dominique Sanda]], [[Erland Josephson]] and [[Robert Powell]], was entangled in controversy.<ref name="Marrone 230">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 230</ref>

In 1979 she began directing operas with ''[[Wozzeck (opera)|Wozzeck]]'' in [[Florence]]; since then she has produced and directed several operas for many theaters in Europe. Subsequent operas include ''[[Iphigénie en Tauride]]'' (1984) and ''[[Medea]]'' (1986) at the [[Opera of Paris]]; ''[[Cardillac]]'' (1991) in Florence; ''[[La vestale]]'' (1993) at the [[Teatro alla Scala]] in Milan; and ''[[La cena delle beffe]]'' (1995) in [[Zürich]].<ref name="O'Healy 427">O'Healy, ''Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies'', p. 427</ref>

=== ''The Skin'' (1981) ===
Her 1981 film, ''[[The Skin|La Pelle]]'' (''The Skin''), was based on the eponymous novel by [[Curzio Malaparte]]. Shown in competition for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, it was aimed at the international market with a star-studded cast, including [[Marcello Mastroianni]], [[Claudia Cardinale]] and [[Burt Lancaster]]. The film is set during the American occupation of [[Naples]] in 1944 during World War II.<ref name="Bondanella 353">Bondanella, ''Italian Cinema'', p. 353</ref>

=== ''Beyond the Door'' (1982) ===
The plot of 1982's ''[[Beyond the Door (1982 film)|Beyond the Door]]'' (''Oltre la porta''), set in North Africa, follows a love triangle between Mathew, an American oil ring worker in love with Nina, a young woman entangled in an affair with her stepfather Enrico, an Italian diplomat who is in jail for the death of Nina's mother. The film, starring [[Marcello Mastroianni]], [[Tom Berenger]] and [[Eleonora Giorgi]], disappointed audiences and critics.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

=== ''The Berlin Affair'' (1985) ===
''[[The Berlin Affair]]'' (''Interno berlinese''), made in 1985, was loosely based on the novel ''[[Quicksand (novel)|Quicksand]]'' by [[Jun'ichirō Tanizaki]].<ref name="Marrone 140">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 140.</ref> Set in Berlin in 1938, on the verge of war, the film tells the story of a German official working for the foreign office and his wife, both of whom are seduced by the young daughter of the Japanese Ambassador to the [[Third Reich]] and are dragged into a perverse love triangle.

The film continued Cavani's interest in transgressive relationships. It was the third part of her trilogy of films with a German setting that began with ''[[The Night Porter]]'' and continued with ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]''.<ref name="Marrone 237">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 237</ref>

=== ''Francesco'' (1989) ===
With ''[[Francesco (film)|Francesco]]'' (1989) Liliana Cavani returned to the life of St [[Francis of Assisi]] in a film starring American actor [[Mickey Rourke]] as the title character, and English actress [[Helena Bonham-Carter]] as Chiara. The film bore little stylistic resemblance to Cavani's earlier efforts.<ref name="Marrone 168">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 168</ref><ref name="Marrone 161">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 161</ref>

In the 1990s Cavani became more interested in staging operas, and devoted less time to filmmaking. She returned to her television roots and directed three TV opera production: [[Verdi]]'s [[La Traviata]] (1992), ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' on [[Pietro Mascagni]] (1996) and [[Puccini]]'s ''[[Manon Lescaut]]'' (1998).<ref name="Bondanella 510">Bondanella, ''Italian Cinema'', p. 510</ref>

=== ''Where Are You? I'm Here'' (1993) ===
''[[Dove siete? Io sono qui|Where Are You? I'm Here]]'' ''(Dove siete? Io sono qui)'' (1993), recounts the love story of Fausto and Elena two deaf youngsters from different backgrounds. He belongs to a wealthy family who has raised him as if he were not deaf, while she comes from a more humble working-class family and has to struggles to complete her education. Set in contemporary Italy, the film is similar to ''The Cannibals'' and ''The Guest'' in its exploration of the themes of silence and isolation.<ref name=" Marrone 189">Marrone, ''The Gaze and the Labyrinth'', p. 189</ref> Like many of Cavani's films, it includes the use of dance.<ref name=" Marrone 189" />

=== ''Ripley's Game'' (2002) ===
In 2002, Cavani made ''[[Ripley's Game (film)|Ripley's Game]]'' (''Il Gioco di Ripley''), based on the novel of the same name by [[Patricia Highsmith]], a sequel to ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley]]''. ''Ripley’s Game'',<ref name="Armstrong 86">Armstrong et al., ''The Rough Guide to Film'', p. 86</ref> was presented out of competition at the Venice Film Festival.

Cavani currently lives in Rome.<ref name="O'Healy 427" /> [[Carpi, Emilia-Romagna|Carpi]], her hometown, has established the Associazione Fondo Liliana Cavani, where her films are preserved and made available for consultation.<ref name="O'Healy 427" />
