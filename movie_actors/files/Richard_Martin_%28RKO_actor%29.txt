Though born in Spokane, Martin's family moved to a Mexican neighbourhood in West Hollywood where he learned to imitate his friends.<ref>http://www.allmovie.com/artist/richard-martin-101481</ref>
He began in films by working as a [[receptionist]] for [[MGM]].<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0552955/bio</ref> When a friend made a bet with his [[theatrical agent|agent]] that the agent couldn't get Martin an actor's contract, Martin's agent won the bet.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/07/obituaries/richard-martin-75-actor-in-westerns.html</ref> He became a prolific contract player for [[RKO Pictures]] in 1942 often appearing unbilled.

Hollywood World War II films often featured many ethnic American enlisted men, and Martin first played Chito Rafferty as a contemporary air crewman in ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]''. He soon repeated the role in the Western ''[[Nevada (1944 film)|Nevada]]'' opposite [[Robert Mitchum]]. He appeared opposite a few other stars in RKO Westerns.

After the war Martin left RKO and had the main role in the last [[Universal Pictures]] [[film serial]] ''[[The Mysterious Mr. M]]'' as well as the title role in a [[1947 in film|1947]] [[Cinecolor]] Western ''The Adventures of Don Coyote''.  When Tim Holt, back from the war was hired by producer [[Herman Schlom]] to star in a Western series, the two pondered who they could get for a sidekick.  Schlom recalled Martin's Rafferty character from ''Nevada''.<ref>p.187 Rothel, David ''Those Great Cowboy Sidekicks'' 1984 Scarecrow Press</ref> Martin returned to RKO in the same year in his first appearance alongside Tim Holt in ''[[Under the Tonto Rim (1947 film)|Under the Tonto Rim]]'', the first of 29 films with Holt that were initially based on stories by [[Zane Grey]].

As B Westerns and exclusive studio contracts gradually ended in the 1950s, Martin found himself out of work and unable to find work due to his ethnic characterisation.  He became an insurance salesman, then came back for one last Western, ''Four Fast Guns'' in 1960.

He was married to actress [[Elaine Riley]].
