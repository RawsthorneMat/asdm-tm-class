Zhang has won numerous awards and recognitions, with Best Foreign Film nominations for ''[[Ju Dou]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'' in 1991, [[Silver Lion]] and [[Golden Lion]] prizes at the [[Venice Film Festival]], [[Grand Jury Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=tribute.ca>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribute.ca/people/Zhang+Yimou/4873|title=Zhang Yimou Bio|publisher=tribute.ca|accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref> In 1993, he was a member of the jury at the [[43rd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1993/04_jury_1993/04_Jury_1993.html |title=Berlinale: 1993 Juries |accessdate=2011-05-29 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> Zhang directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games, which received considerable international acclaim.

One of Zhang's recurrent themes is the resilience of Chinese people in the face of hardship and adversity, a theme which has been explored in such films as, for example, ''[[To Live (film)|To Live]]'' (1994) and ''[[Not One Less]]'' (1999). His films are particularly noted for their rich use of colour, as can be seen in some of his early films, like ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'', and in his [[wuxia]] films like ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' and ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]''. His most recent film is a historical drama film called ''[[Coming Home (2014 film)|Coming Home]]''.

==Early life==
Zhang was born in [[Xi'an]], the capital of [[Shaanxi]] province. Zhang's father, a dermatologist, had been an officer in the [[National Revolutionary Army]] under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]], an uncle, and an elder brother had followed the Nationalist forces to [[Taiwan]] after their 1949 defeat. As a result, Zhang faced difficulties in his early life.<ref>''Memoirs from the Beijing Film Academy: The Genesis of China's Fifth Generation.'' Ni Zhen, translated by Chris Berry. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002, pp. 44.</ref><ref name=notablebiographies>{{Cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Sp-Z/Zhang-Yimou.html|title=Zhang Yimou|accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref>

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s and 1970s, Zhang left his school studies and went to work, first as a farm labourer for 3 years, and later at a cotton textile mill for 7 years in the city of [[Xianyang]].<ref name=notablebiographies/><ref>''Memoirs from the Beijing Film Academy: The Genesis of China's Fifth Generation.'' Ni Zhen, translated by Chris Berry. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002, pp. 45-6.</ref> During this time he took up painting and amateur still photography. In 1978, he went to Beijing Film Academy and majored in photography. He has an Honorary Doctorate Degree from Boston University and also one from Harvard University.

==Early career==
When the [[Beijing Film Academy]] reopened its doors to new students in 1978, following the abandonment of policies adopted during the [[Cultural Revolution]], Zhang, at 27, was over the regulation age for admission, and was without the prerequisite academic qualifications. After a personal appeal to the Ministry of Culture, and showing a portfolio of his personal photographic works, the authorities relented and admitted him to the Faculty  of Cinematography. Zhang graduated with the class of 1982, which also included [[Chen Kaige]], [[Tian Zhuangzhuang]], and [[Zhang Junzhao]]. The class went on to form the core of the [[Cinema of China#The rise of the Fifth Generation, 1980s-1990s|Fifth Generation]], who were a part of an artistic reemergence in China after the end of the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=Farquhar/><ref name=notablebiographies/><ref name=NYTimesCrow>{{Cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/117624/Zhang-Yimou/biography|title=Zhang Yimou|author=Crow, Jonathan|publisher = New York Times|accessdate=2010-09-01}}</ref>

Zhang and his co-graduates were assigned to small regional studios, and Zhang was sent to work for the [[Guangxi]] Film Studio as a cinematographer. Though originally intended to work as director's assistants, the graduates soon discovered there was a dearth of directors so soon after the Cultural Revolution, and gained permission to start making their own films. This led to the production of Zhang Junzhao's ''[[One and Eight]]'', on which Zhang Yimou worked as director of photography, and Chen Kaige's ''[[Yellow Earth]]'', in 1984. These two films were successes at the [[Hong Kong Film Festival]] and helped to bring the new Chinese cinema to the attention of worldwide audiences, signaling a departure from the earlier propagandist films of the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=Farquhar/><ref name=NYTimesCrow/> ''Yellow Earth'' is today widely considered the inaugural film of the Fifth Generation directors.<ref name=NYTimesCrow/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html| title =  A Centennial Review of Chinese Cinema | accessdate = 2008-08-21 |date= 2003-10-10| author = Zhang Yingjin |publisher = The University of California, San Diego}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.llc.ed.ac.uk/cinema-china/briefhistory.html|title= A Brief History of Chinese Film|accessdate = 2008-08-21|publisher= The University of Edinburgh-Cinema China '07 }}</ref>

In 1985, after moving back to his home town of Xi'an, Zhang was engaged as cinematographer and lead actor for director [[Wu Tianming]]'s upcoming film ''[[Old Well (film)|Old Well]]'', which was subsequently released in 1987. The lead role won Zhang a Best Actor award at the [[Tokyo International Film Festival]].<ref name=NYTimesCrow/>

==Film director==

=== 1980s ===
1987 saw the release of Zhang's directorial debut, ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'', starring Chinese actress [[Gong Li]] in her first leading role. ''Red Sorghum'' was met with critical acclaim, bringing Zhang to the forefront of the world's art directors, and winning him a [[Golden Bear]] for Best Picture at the [[38th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1988/03_preistr_ger_1988/03_Preistraeger_1988.html| title = Berlinale - Archive - Annual Archives - 1988 - Prize Winners | publisher = [[Berlin International Film Festival]] | accessdate = 2008-08-21}}</ref>

''[[Codename Cougar]]'' (or ''The Puma Action''), a minor experiment in the political thriller genre, was released in 1989, featuring [[Gong Li]] and eminent Chinese actor [[Ge You]]. However, it garnered less-than-positive reviews at home and Zhang himself later dismissed the film as his worst.<ref>http://www.wzrb.com.cn/node2/node142/userobject8ai220559.html</ref>

In the same year, Zhang began work on his next project, the period drama ''[[Ju Dou]]''. Starring Gong Li in the eponymous lead role, along with [[Li Baotian]] as the male lead, ''Ju Dou'', garnered as much critical acclaim as had ''Red Sorghum'', and became China's first film to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/cteq/red_sorghum/| title =  Red Sorghum: A Search for Roots  | accessdate = 2008-08-28| author= Neo, David |date=September 2003| publisher = ''[[Senses of Cinema]]'' |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080802224322/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/03/28/red_sorghum.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-08-02}}</ref>

In 1989, he was a member of the jury at the [[16th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name="Moscow1989">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1989 |title=16th Moscow International Film Festival (1989) |accessdate=2013-02-24 |work=MIFF}}</ref>

===1990s===
After the success of ''Ju Dou'', Zhang began work on ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]''. Based on [[Su Tong]]'s novel ''[[Wives and Concubines]]'', the film depicted the realities of life in a wealthy family compound during the 1920s. [[Gong Li]] was again featured in the lead role, her fourth collaboration with Zhang as director.

''Raise the Red Lantern'' received almost unanimous international acclaim. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' noted its "voluptuous physical beauty" and sumptuous use of colours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920327/REVIEWS/203270303/1023 |title =Raise the Red Lantern :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews | author = Ebert, Roger | publisher = ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' | date = 1992-03-12| accessdate =2008-08-21}}</ref> Gong Li's acting was also praised as starkly contrasting with the roles she played in Zhang's earlier films. ''Raise the Red Lantern'' was nominated in the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category at the [[64th Academy Awards|1992 Academy Awards]], becoming the second Chinese film to earn this distinction (after Zhang's ''Ju Dou''). It eventually lost out to [[Gabriele Salvatores]]'s ''[[Mediterraneo (film)|Mediterraneo]]''.

Zhang's next directorial work, ''[[The Story of Qiu Ju]]'', in 1992, once again starring Gong Li in the lead role. The film, which tells the tale of a peasant woman seeking justice for her husband after he was beaten by a village official, was a hit at film festivals and won the [[Golden Lion]] award at the 1992 [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref>Kleid, Beth (September 14, 1992). "MOVIES." ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', p. 2.</ref>

Next, Zhang directed ''[[To Live (film)|To Live]]'', an epic film based on the novel by [[Yu Hua (author)|Yu Hua]] of the same name. ''To Live'' highlighted the resilience of the ordinary Chinese people, personified by its two main characters, amidst three generations of upheavals throughout Chinese politics of the 20th century. It was banned in China, but released at the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]] and won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Jury Prize]], as well as earning a Best Actor prize for [[Ge You]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/1994/awardCompetition.html|title=Festival de Cannes: Awards 1994| publisher = [[Cannes Film Festival]] | accessdate = 2008-08-21}}</ref><ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19941223/REVIEWS/412230303/1023 To Live - by Roger Ebert]</ref> ''To Live'' was banned in [[China]] by the Chinese [[State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television]], due to its critical portrayal of various policies and campaigns of the Communist government.<ref>''Zhang Yimou''. Frances K. Gateward, Yimou Zhang, [[University Press of Mississippi]], 2001, pp. 63-4.</ref>

''[[Shanghai Triad]]'' followed in 1995, featuring Gong Li in her seventh film under Zhang's direction. The two had developed a romantic as well as a professional relationship, but this would end during production of ''Shanghai Triad''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960216/REVIEWS/602160304/1023| title = Shanghai Triad| author = Ebert, Roger| publisher= ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' | date = 1996-02-16|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> Zhang and Gong would not work together again until 2006's ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]''.

1997 saw the release of ''[[Keep Cool (film)|Keep Cool]]'', a [[black comedy]] film about life in modern China. ''Keep Cool'' marked only the second time Zhang had set a film in the modern era, after ''The Story of Qiu Ju''.

As in ''The Story of Qiu Ju'', Zhang returned to the [[neorealism (art)|neorealist]] habit of employing non-professional actors and location shooting for ''[[Not One Less]]'' in 1999<ref>{{Cite journal| journal=Persimmons | year=2001 | volume=1 | issue=3 | title=Not One Less | url=http://www.chinesecinemas.org/notoneless.html | last=Kraicer | first=Shelly | accessdate=9 September 2009 | pages=85}}</ref><ref name=philly>{{Cite news| title=In a Chinese village, the teacher is 13 | last=Rea | first=Steven | work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date=24 March 2000}}</ref><ref name=losingamuse>{{Cite news| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Losing a Muse and Moving On | last=Feinstein | first=Howard | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/06/movies/losing-a-muse-and-moving-on.html?pagewanted=all | date=6 February 2000 | accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref> which won him his second [[Golden Lion]] prize in Venice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117755601.html|title=Chinese best at Venice fest| author = Rooney, David| publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date =1999-09-13|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>

Shot immediately after ''Not One Less'', Zhang's 1999 film  ''[[The Road Home (1999 film)|The Road Home]]'' featured a new leading lady in the form of the young actress [[Zhang Ziyi]], in her film debut. The film is based on a simple throw-back narrative centering on a love story between the narrator's parents.

===2000&ndash;present===
''[[Happy Times]]'', a relatively minor film by Zhang, was based loosely on the short story ''Shifu: You'll Do Anything for a Laugh'', by [[Mo Yan]]. Starring popular Chinese actor [[Zhao Benshan]] and actress [[Dong Jie]], it was an official selection for the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] in 2002.

Zhang's next major project was the ambitious [[wuxia]] drama ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'', released in China in 2002. With an impressive lineup of Asian stars, including [[Jet Li]], [[Maggie Cheung]], [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], and [[Donnie Yen]], ''Hero'' told a fictional tale about Ying Zheng, the King of the [[State of Qin]] (later to become the first [[Qin Shi Huang|Emperor of China]]), and his would-be assassins. The film was released in North America in 2004, two years after its Chinese release, by American distributor [[Miramax Films]], and became a huge international hit. ''Hero'' was one of the few foreign-language films to debut at number 1 at the U.S. box office,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E4DA1F3EF933A0575BC0A9629C8B63|title= Kung Fu Power for 'Hero' at Box Office|publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' |date= 2004-08-30| accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> and was one of the nominees for Best Foreign Language Film at the [[75th Academy Awards|2003 Academy Awards]].

Zhang followed up the huge success of ''Hero'' with another martial arts epic, ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'', in 2004.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501040419-610119,00.html|title=Zhang Yimou Interview| publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |author = Gough, Neil| date =2004-04-12|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> Set in the [[Tang Dynasty]], it starred [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Andy Lau]], and [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]] as characters caught in a dangerous love triangle. ''House of Flying Daggers'' received acclaim from critics, who noted the use of colour that harked back to some of Zhang's earlier works.<ref name="meta">{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/houseofflyingdaggers|title=House of Flying Daggers|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2009-01-14}}</ref>

Released in [[China]] in 2005, ''[[Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles]]'' was a return to the more low-key drama that characterized much of Zhang's middle period pieces. The film stars [[Japanese people|Japanese]] actor [[Ken Takakura]], as a father who wishes to repair relations with his alienated son, and is eventually led by circumstance to set out on a journey to [[China]]. Zhang had been an admirer of Takakura for over thirty years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-12/18/content_504306.htm|title= Zhang Yimou's new film makes domestic debut| publisher = ''[[China Daily]]'' |date=2005-12-18| accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>

2006's ''[[Curse of the Golden Flower]]'' saw him reunited with leading actress [[Gong Li]]. Taiwanese singer [[Jay Chou]] and Hong Kong star [[Chow Yun-fat]] also starred in the period epic based on a play by [[Cao Yu]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/movies/21flow.html|title=Curse of the Golden Flower - Movie - Review| author = Catsoulis, Jeannette |publisher =''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2006-12-21 |accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>

Zhang's recent films, and his involvement with the 2008 Olympic ceremonies, have not been without controversy. Some critics claim that his recent works, contrary to his earlier films, have received approval from the Chinese government. However, in interviews, Zhang has said that he is not interested in politics, and that it was an honour for him to direct the Olympic ceremonies because it was "a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."<ref name=nytimescrit>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/sports/olympics/08guru.html| title= Gritty Renegade Now Directs China’s Close-Up|author=Barboza, David| publisher = ''The New York Times''|date=2008-08-07|accessdate=2009-01-01}}</ref>

In 2008, he won a [[Peabody Award]] "for creating a spell-binding, unforgettable celebration of the Olympic promise, featuring a cast of thousands" at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/beijing-olympics-opening-ceremony-and-zhang-yimou 68th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2009.</ref>

On May 24, 2010, Zhang was awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree by [[Yale University]], and was described as "a genius with camera and choreography."<ref>[http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=7589 Citations for Recipients of Honorary Degrees at Yale University 2010]</ref>

Zhang's 2011 ''[[The Flowers of War]]'' was his most expensive film to date, budgeting for $90.2 million.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?big_expectations_for_zhang_yimous_the_13_women_of_nanjing_16652.aspx | title = Big expectations for Zhang Yimou's The 13 Women of Nanjing | publisher = Asia Pacific Arts | date = 2011-04-18}}</ref>

==Stage direction==
Starting in the 1990s, Zhang Yimou has been directing stage productions in parallel with his film career.

In 1998, he directed an acclaimed version of [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s opera ''[[Turandot]]'', firstly in [[Florence]] and then later [[Turandot at the Forbidden City]], [[Beijing]], with [[Zubin Mehta]] conducting, the latter documented in the film ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262076/ The Turandot Project (2000)]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E3DF143FF932A3575AC0A96E958260|title= Turandot - Directed by ZHANG Yimou, at the Forbidden City Beijing|author =Eckholm, Erik | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date= 1998-09-01| accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> He reprised his version of ''Turandot'' in October 2009, at the [[Beijing National Stadium|Bird's Nest Stadium]] in [[Beijing]], and plans to tour with the production in Europe, Asia and Australia in 2010.

In 2001, Zhang adapted his 1991 film ''Raise the Red Lantern'' for the stage, directing a [[ballet]] version.<ref>[http://russian.china.org.cn/english/MATERIAL/70826.htm Director Zhang Yimou Fine Tunes 'Red Lantern' Ballet]</ref>

Zhang has co-directed a number of outdoor folk musicals under the title ''Impression''. These include ''Impression, Liu Sanjie'', which opened in August 2003 at the Li River, Guangxi province;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-08/17/content_255620.htm|title="Liu Sanjie" performed in natural scenic setting| publisher = ''[[China Daily]]'' | date = 2003-08-17| accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref> ''Impression Lijiang'', in June 2006 at the foot of [[Jade Dragon Snow Mountain]] in [[Lijiang, Yunnan|Lijiang]], Yunnan province; ''Impression West Lake'', in late 2007 at the West Lake in [[Hangzhou]], Zhejiang province; ''Impression Hainan'' in late 2009, set in [[Hainan Island]]; and ''Impression Dahongpao'' set on Mount Wuyi, in Fujian province. All five performances were co-directed by Wang Chaoge and Fan Yue.

Zhang also led the production of [[Tan Dun]]'s opera, ''[[The First Emperor]]'', which had its world premiere at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] on 21 December 2006.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/arts/music/01lips.htm|title=The Great Wall Rises (and Falls) at the Met |author =Morris, Lois B. & Lipsyte, Robert |publisher = ''The New York Times'' |date=2006-10-01|accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>

==2008 Beijing Olympics opening and closing ceremonies==
Zhang Yimou was chosen to direct the Beijing portion of the closing ceremonies of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], as well as the [[2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony|opening]] and [[2008 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony|closing]] ceremonies of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], China, alongside co-director and choreographer [[Zhang Jigang]].<ref name=FiveGenerals>{{Cite web|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/culture/ceremonies/n214143744.shtml|title=Zhang Yimou and his five creative generals|publisher = Official Website of the Beijing [[2008 Summer Olympic Games|2008 Olympic Games]]| accessdate=2008-08-21}}</ref>

Zhang was a runner-up for the [[Time Magazine Person of the Year]] award in 2008. [[Steven Spielberg]], who withdrew as an adviser to the Olympic ceremonies to pressure China into helping with the conflict in Darfur, described Zhang's works in the Olympic ceremonies in ''Time magazine'', saying "At the heart of Zhang's Olympic ceremonies was the idea that the conflict of man foretells the desire for inner peace. This theme is one he's explored and perfected in his films, whether they are about the lives of humble peasants or exalted royalty. This year he captured this prevalent theme of harmony and peace, which is the spirit of the Olympic Games.

==Investigation relating to possible violations of One Child Policy==
Associated Press reported on May 9, 2013 that Zhang was being investigated for violating China's [[one-child policy]].

According to the mainstream media in China, Zhang married Chen Ting,<ref>[http://www.baike.com/wiki/陈婷 陈婷_陈婷[张艺谋妻子&#93;_互动百科<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> who is a dancer in December 2011; she had three children with him. However, when the news came out, Zhang had no immediate response. On November 29, 2013, under pressure from the public and criticism on the Internet, Zhang's studio released a statement that acknowledged Chen Ting and their three children. On January 9, 2014, the Lake District Family Planning Bureau, in accord with China's one-child policy, said Zhang was required to pay an unplanned birth and social maintenance fee totaling RMB 7.48 million (roughly US $1.2 million).<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2013-05/09/c_124683925.htm 揭秘张艺谋娇妻陈婷：相貌不似“谋女郎”贵妇气质 - 海外华人 - 新华网<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/09/world/asia/filmmaker-one-child-policy-fine/ China: Filmmaker Zhang Yimou fined $1M for breach of one-child policy - CNN.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On February 7, 2014, it was reported that Zhang had paid the fee.<ref>{{cite news|title=Director Zhang Yimou Pays $1.2M for Having 3 Kids|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/director-zhang-yimou-pays-12m-kids-22405066|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=go.com|date=8 February 2014}}</ref>
