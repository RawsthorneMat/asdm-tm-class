'''Howard Terbell McNear''' (January 27, 1905 &ndash; January 3, 1969)<ref>Record of Howard McNear, [[Social Security Death Index]].</ref><ref>Record of Howard T. McNear. Ancestry.com. ''California Death Index, 1940-1997'' [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2000.</ref> was an American stage, screen and radio [[character actor]]. McNear is best remembered as [[Floyd Lawson]], the barber in ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' and as Doc Charles Adams in CBS Radio's ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1952–1961).

==Career==
McNear was born in [[Los Angeles]] to Luzetta M. Spencer and Franklin E. McNear.<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/mcnear.htm Ancestry.com community; Howard T. McNear]</ref> He studied at the Oatman School of Theater and later joined a stock company in [[San Diego]].<ref name="kelly">{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Richard Michael |title=The Andy Griffith Show|year=1985|publisher=John F. Blair, Publisher|isbn=0-895-87522-5|page=49}}</ref> McNear also worked in radio from the late 1930s, distinguishing himself in the 1937–1940 radio serial ''[[Speed Gibson of the International Secret Police]]'' as ace operator Clint Barlow.<ref>[http://www.audio-classics.com/lspeedgibson.html Radio Broadcast Log Of: ''Speed Gibson of the International Secret Police]</ref> McNear could be effective in such authoritative roles, but he gravitated more toward character roles, often comic. 

He enlisted as a private in the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] on November 17, 1942 during [[World War II]].<ref>National Archives and Records Administration. ''U.S. World War II Army Enlistment Records, 1938-1946'' [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2005.</ref>
<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Gunsmokeradio.jpg|left|thumb|As "Doc" in the ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' radio cast]] -->
He created the role of Doc Charles Adams in CBS Radio's ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1952–1961).<ref>[http://comp.uark.edu/~tsnyder/gunsmoke/gun-radio.html ''Gunsmoke'' Radio series information]</ref> McNear was under contract to CBS for many years and was featured in many of the network's radio and TV programs. From 1955 to 1960 he appeared frequently, in various quirky roles, in the popular radio detective series ''[[Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar]]''.<ref>[http://ppages.bfree.on.ca/rdrake/otr/crime/johnnydollar.htm Golden Age of Radio]</ref> 

McNear made his film debut in an uncredited role in the 1953 film ''[[Escape from Fort Bravo]]''. Over the course of his career, he would appear in over 100 film and television guest spots. In 1958, McNear guest starred as a barber named Andy on an episode of ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', a role which proved prophetic.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0630315/ ''Leave it to Beaver'' episode info, "The Shave"]</ref> In 1961, he was cast as the vague, chatty barber [[Floyd Lawson]] on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''. During the show's run, McNear suffered a [[stroke]] that rendered the left side of his body nearly paralyzed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a4ksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2PoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4512,7819084&dq=howard+mcnear+stroke&hl=en|title=TV's Answer Man|last=Shull|first=Richard K.|date=June 27, 1976|work=Lakeland Ledger|accessdate=May 14, 2013}}</ref> McNear left the series for nearly a year and a half to recover. Andy Griffith later asked McNear to return to the series. McNear agreed but was unable to walk or stand. The effect to Floyd's character was noticeable. Floyd spoke more slowly, usually drawing out words or phrases which, unexpectedly, made the character funnier and more endearing. The production crew accommodated his disability and McNear was usually seen seated or standing with the support of a stand.<ref name="kelly" /> Many scenes were shot with him sitting on a bench outside the barber shop, as opposed to actively trimming hair as before. According to [[Jack Dodson]] (who played [[Howard Sprague]] on ''Andy Griffith''), McNear began having difficulty remembering his lines and became anxious and frustrated.<ref>Kelly 1985 p.65</ref> He left the series in 1967.

==Death==
On January 3, 1969, McNear died of complications from [[pneumonia]] caused by a [[stroke]] at San Fernando Valley Veterans Hospital in [[San Fernando, California]].<ref name=nytimes>"Howard McNear, Actor, 63; On Andy Griffith Show", ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 7, 1969, p. 38.</ref> He was interred in the [[Los Angeles National Cemetery]].<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=1865 Find a Grave, Howard McNear]</ref> Actor and old friend [[Parley Baer]], a practicing [[Episcopal Church in the United States|Episcopalian]], delivered his eulogy. His wife, Helen, and son, Christopher, survived him.<ref name=nytimes />

==In popular culture==

In two episodes of the comedy sketch program ''[[Second City Television]]'', actor [[Eugene Levy]] played McNear's [[Floyd Lawson|Floyd the Barber]]. His first appearance as Floyd the Barber was in a parody of ''[[The Godfather]]'', in the opening scene as Amerigo Bonasera, in which he asks the Don to hurt Opie for breaking his barber pole. The last line delivered by Floyd is "Ohh, and would you kill [[Howard Sprague]] for me?", referring to another character from the ''[[Andy Griffith Show]]''. His other appearance was ''The Merv Griffith Show'' (a combination parody of the ''Andy Griffith Show'' and the ''[[Merv Griffin Show]]''), in which he is in his barber shop cutting hair and at a surprise party for Gomer.
