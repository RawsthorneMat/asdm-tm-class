'''William Friedkin''' (born August 29, 1935)<ref name="Biskind200">Biskind, p. 200.</ref> is an American film director, producer and screenwriter best known for directing ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' in 1971 and ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' in 1973; for the former, he won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. Some of his other films include ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'', ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'', ''[[To Live and Die in L.A. (film)|To Live and Die in L.A.]]'', ''[[Jade (film)|Jade]]'', ''[[Rules of Engagement (film)|Rules of Engagement]]'', ''[[The Hunted (2003 film)|The Hunted]]'', ''[[Bug (2006 film)|Bug]]'', and ''[[Killer Joe (film)|Killer Joe]]''.

==Early life==
Friedkin was born in August 1935 in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Rachael ([[née]] Green) and Louis Friedkin. His father was a semi-professional softball player, merchant seaman, and men's clothing salesman. His mother, whom Friedkin called "a saint", was an [[operating room]] [[registered nurse]].<ref name="Biskind200" /> His parents were [[Jewish]] immigrants from [[Ukraine]].<ref>[http://www.jewishjournal.com/the_ticket/item/killer_joes_william_friedkin_i_could_have_been_a_very_violent_person_video_/ Pfefferman, Naomi. "'Killer Joe's' William Friedkin: 'I Could Have Been a Very Violent Person'." ''Jewish Journal.'' August 2, 2012.] Accessed 2013-04-29.</ref> His grandparents, parents, and other relatives fled Ukraine during a particularly violent [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire#1903–1906|anti-Jewish pogrom]] in 1903.<ref>Friedkin, ''The Friedkin Connection'', p. 1.</ref> Friedkin's father was somewhat uninterested in making money, and the family was generally lower middle class while he was growing up.<ref name="Biskind200" /> According to film historian [[Peter Biskind]], "Friedkin viewed his father with a mixture of affection and contempt for not making more of himself."<ref name="Biskind200" />  According to his memoir, The Friedkin Connection, Friedkin had the utmost affection for his father.

Friedkin attended public schools in Chicago.  He enrolled at [[Senn High School]], where he played basketball well enough to consider turning professional.<ref name="Biskind201">Biskind, p. 201.</ref> Friedkin was not a serious student and barely received grades good enough to graduate,<ref>Segaloff, p. 25.</ref> which he did at the age of 16.<ref>Wakeman, p. 372.</ref> According to Friedkin, this was because of [[social promotion]] and not because he was bright.<ref>Friedkin, ''Conversations at the American Film Institute...'', p. 186.</ref>

Friedkin began going to movies as a teenager,<ref name="Biskind201" /> and has cited ''[[Citizen Kane]] ''as one of his key influences. Several sources claim that Friedkin saw this motion picture as a teenager,<ref>Emery, p. 237; Claggett, p. 3.</ref> but Friedkin himself says that he did not see the film until 1960, when he was 25 years old. Only then, Friedkin says, did he become a true cineaste.<ref>Friedkin, ''The Friedkin Connection'', p. 9.</ref> Among the movies which he saw as a teenager and young adult were ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]'', ''[[The Wages of Fear]]'', and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (which he viewed repeatedly, like ''Citizen Kane''). Televised documentaries, such as 1960's ''[[Harvest of Shame]]'', also were important in his developing sense of cinema.<ref name="Biskind201" />

He began working in the mail room at [[WGN-TV]] immediately after high school.<ref>Stevens, p. 184.</ref> Within two years (at the age of 18),<ref name="LitFilmQ">Walker and Johnson, p. 15.</ref> he started his [[television director|directorial]] career doing live television shows and documentaries.<ref>Derry, p. 361; Edmonds and Mimura, p. 211.</ref> His efforts included ''[[The People vs. Paul Crump]]'' (made with [[Bill Butler (cinematographer)|Bill Butler]] in 1962) which won an award at the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]] and contributed to the commutation of [[Paul Crump|Crump's]] [[death sentence]].<ref name="LitFilmQ" /><ref>Hamm, p. 86-87.</ref> Its success helped Friedkin get a job with producer [[David L. Wolper]].<ref name="LitFilmQ" />

==Career==
As mentioned in Friedkin's voice-over commentary on the DVD re-release of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', Friedkin directed one of the last episodes of ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' in 1965, called "Off Season".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0394072/|last=|title=Off Season 1965|first=|publisher=IMDb|page=2 |accessdate=September 8, 2009}}</ref> Hitchcock admonished Friedkin for not wearing a tie while directing.<ref>"Vertigo: The Legacy Series" Universal, 2008</ref><!-- I'm sorry, not sure how to insert a reference to a DVD, I don't think this is the correct format.  Friedkin relates this story on the commentary part of the DVD -->

In 1965 Friedkin moved to Hollywood and two years later released his first feature film, ''[[Good Times (film)|Good Times]]'' starring [[Sonny and Cher]].  In 1967 he directed a TV pilot for the ABC network called "The Pickle Brothers".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} It was written and produced by [[Dee Caruso]] and [[Gerald Gardner (scriptwriter)|Gerald Gardner]], and [[Quincy Jones]] did the music. Several other "art" films followed, including the gay-themed movie ''[[The Boys in the Band]]'' and most notably ''[[The Birthday Party (film)|The Birthday Party]]'', based on an unpublished screenplay by [[Harold Pinter]], which he adapted from his own play. Friedkin, however, did not want to be known as an [[Art film|art house]] director, but rather for action and serious drama through stories about an America upended by crime, hypocrisy, the occult, and amorality. All of which he mounted up into his films to reflect what was going on in an America that was changing in the wake of [[Vietnam]], the [[Sexual Revolution]], and [[Watergate]].

In 1971, his ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' was released to wide critical acclaim.  Shot in a gritty style more suited for documentaries than Hollywood features, the film won five [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]].

Friedkin followed up with 1973's ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', based on [[William Peter Blatty]]'s best-selling novel, which revolutionized the horror genre and is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time.  ''The Exorcist'' was nominated for 10 [[Academy Awards]], including Best Picture and Best Director. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Screenplay]] Award.

Following these two critically acclaimed pictures, Friedkin, along with [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Peter Bogdanovich]], was deemed one of the premier directors of [[New Hollywood]]; but Friedkin's later movies did not achieve the same success.  ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'' (1977), a $22 million American [[remake]] of the French classic ''[[The Wages of Fear (film)|Wages of Fear]]'', starring [[Roy Scheider]], was overshadowed by the [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] box-office success of ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', which had been released exactly one month prior. Friedkin considers it his finest film, and was personally devastated by its financial and critical failure (as mentioned by Friedkin himself in the documentary series ''The Directors'' (1999)).

''Sorcerer'' was shortly followed by the crime-comedy ''[[The Brink's Job]]'' (1978), based on the real-life [[Great Brink's Robbery]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which was also unsuccessful at the box-office. In 1980, he directed the highly controversial gay-themed crime thriller ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'', starring [[Al Pacino]], which was protested against even during its making and remains the subject of heated debate.

Friedkin suffered a major heart attack on March 6, 1981. He had a genetically-caused defect in his [[Circumflex branch of left coronary artery|circumflex left coronary artery]], and nearly died. He spent months in rehabilitation.<ref>Biskind, p. 413.</ref>

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Friedkin's films received mostly lackluster reviews and moderate ticket sales. ''[[Deal of the Century]]'' (1983), starring [[Chevy Chase]], [[Gregory Hines]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]], was sometimes regarded as a latter-day ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', though it was generally savaged by critics. However, his action/crime movie ''[[To Live and Die in L.A. (film)|To Live and Die in L.A.]]'' (1985), starring [[William Petersen]] and [[Willem Dafoe]], was a critical favorite and drew comparisons to Friedkin's own ''The French Connection'' (particularly for its car-chase sequence), while his courtroom-drama/thriller ''[[Rampage (1987 film)|Rampage]]'' (1987) received a fairly positive review from [[Roger Ebert]] despite major distribution problems. ''[[The Guardian (1990 film)|The Guardian]]'' (1990) and ''[[Jade (film)|Jade]]'' (1995), starring [[Linda Fiorentino]], received a somewhat favorable response from critics and audiences. Friedkin even said that ''Jade'' was the favorite of all the films he had made.<ref>{{cite book|last=William|first=Linda Ruth|title=The Erotic Thriller in Contemporary Cinema|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|date=2005|page=140|isbn=0-253-21836-5}}</ref>

In 2000, ''The Exorcist'' was re-released in theaters with extra footage and grossed $40 million in the U.S. alone. Friedkin's involvement in 2007's ''[[Bug (2007 film)|Bug]]'' resulted from a positive experience watching the stage version in 2004. He was surprised to find that he was, metaphorically, on the same page as the playwright and felt that he could relate well to the story.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=20415|title=EXCL: Bug Director William Friedkin}}</ref> The film won the [[FIPRESCI]] prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].

Later, Friedkin directed an episode of the TV series ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' titled "Cockroaches," which re-teamed him with ''To Live and Die in L.A.'' star William Petersen. He directed again for CSI's 200th episode, "Mascara."

In June 2010, author [[William Peter Blatty]], promoting his latest novel, revealed that Friedkin had committed to direct the feature film adaptation of his thriller, ''[[Dimiter]]''.<ref>[http://authorsontourlive.com/crazy/ "Crazy by William Peter Blatty"], ''authorsontourlive.com'', June 30, 2010</ref> This would mark almost forty years since their previous collaboration, ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', not counting the failed collaboration between the two on ''[[The Exorcist III]]''. The idea for the book itself actually came to Blatty while sitting in Friedkin's office in 1972 during the first film's production, as he read an article concerning the then atheist-run state of Albania executing a priest for baptizing a newborn infant.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-friedkin/a-quiet-little-thriller_b_637023.html "William Friedkin : Director, producer and screenwriter : A Quiet Little Thriller"], ''The Huffington Post'', July 6, 2010</ref> He has been working on it on and off ever since 1974, and, upon its completion, sat down with Friedkin for a one-on-one interview in [[The Huffington Post]] a few days after Blatty named Friedkin as attached to direct. According to the author, his friend and director has been eager to adapt the story for the last three years.

In 2011 Friedkin directed ''[[Killer Joe (film)|Killer Joe]]'', a black comedy written by [[Tracy Letts]], and starring [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Emile Hirsch]], [[Juno Temple]], [[Gina Gershon]], and [[Thomas Haden Church]]. ''Killer Joe'' premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival, prior to its North American debut at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.  It opened in U.S. theaters in July 2012, to favorable reviews from critics.

In April 2013 Friedkin published a [[memoir]], ''The Friedkin Connection''.<ref>Friedkin, William. ''The Friedkin Connection: A Memoir.'' New York: HarperCollins, 2013.</ref> He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the [[70th Venice International Film Festival]] in September.<ref name="Friedkin">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22387152 |title=William Friedkin to receive Venice honour|work=BBC News}}</ref>
