'''Victor Andrew de Bier Everleigh McLaglen''' (10 December 1886 – 7 November 1959) was an [[England|English]] [[Boxing|boxer]] and [[World War I]] veteran who became a successful [[film actor]].<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', 11 November 1959, page 79.</ref>
Towards the end of his life he was naturalised as a U.S. citizen.

==Early life==
McLaglen was born in [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]]. His father, later a bishop of the [[Free Protestant Episcopal Church]] of England,<ref>[http://bloomsburypeople.blogspot.com/2009/12/victor-mclaglens-father-new-revelations.html''Victor McLaglen’s father – new revelations''; [[Peter Anson]] BISHOPS AT LARGE (1964) has further information on Bishop McLaglen.]</ref> moved the family to [[South Africa]] when McLaglen was a child. He had eight brothers and a sister.  Four of his brothers also became actors:  Arthur (1888–1972), an actor and sculptor, and Clifford (1892–1978), Cyril (1899–1987) and Kenneth (circa 1901-1979).<ref>[http://1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=49416 ''Victor McLaglen, Query'']. Great War Forum. Invisionzone.com. 19 March 2006.</ref> Other siblings included Frederick (b. circa 1882), Sydney (b. circa 1884), Lewis (b. circa 1889), and a sister, Lily (b. circa 1893). Another brother, Leopold McLaglen (1884-1951), who appeared in one film, gained notoriety prior to World War I as a showman and self-proclaimed World [[Jujutsu]] Champion,<ref>[http://ejmas.com/jnc/jncart_McLaglan_1202.htm "The Science of Jiujitsu"]. ''Journal of Non-lethal Combatives''. December 2002.</ref> who authored a book on the subject.<ref>Noble, Graham. [http://www.dragon-tsunami.org/Dtimes/Pages/articlee.htm ''Early Ju-jutsu: The Challenges'']. Dragon-Tsunami.org.</ref>

===Before Hollywood===
He left home at fourteen to join the [[British Army]] with the intention of fighting in the [[Second Boer War]]. However, much to his chagrin, he was stationed at [[Windsor Castle]] in the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]]<ref>http://www.householdcavalry.net/history/4587346307</ref> and was later forced to leave the army when his true age was discovered.

Four years later, he moved to [[Canada]], where he earned a living as a wrestler and heavyweight boxer, with several notable wins in the ring. One of his most famous fights was against [[Heavyweight]] Champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], in a 6 round exhibition bout.<ref name="boxing">[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/mclaglen.htm ''Victor McLaglen'']. Cyber Boxing Zone.</ref> This was Johnson's first bout since winning the heavyweight title from [[Tommy Burns (boxer)|Tommy Burns]]. Between bouts, McLaglen toured with a circus, which offered $25 to anyone who could go three rounds with him. He returned to [[UK|Britain]] in 1913 and during [[World War I]] served as a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] ([[Acting (rank)|acting]]) with the 10th Battalion, [[Middlesex Regiment]], part of [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]. Later he claimed to have served with the [[Royal Irish Fusiliers]]. He served for a time as military [[Provost Marshal]] for the city of [[Baghdad]].<ref>[http://1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=38586&hl=McLaglen+myth ''Victor McLaglen myth?'']. Great War Forum. Invisionzone.com. 26 September 2005.</ref> He also continued boxing, and was named Heavyweight Champion of the [[British Army]] in 1918.<ref name="boxing"/> After the war, he began taking roles in British [[silent film]]s.

===Film career===
[[File:WhatPriceGlory.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edmund Lowe]], [[Dolores del Rio]] and McLaglen in ''[[What Price Glory? (1926 film)|What Price Glory?]]'']]
[[File:Gunga Din (1939) trailer 1.jpg|left|thumb|McLaglen and [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'']]
McLaglen's career took a surprise turn in the 1920s, when he moved to [[Hollywood]]. He became a popular character actor, with a particular knack for playing drunks. He also usually played Irishmen, leading many film fans to mistakenly assume he was Irish rather than English. McLaglen played one of the titular ''[[The Unholy Three (1925 film)|Unholy Three]]'' in [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]'s original silent version of the macabre crime drama. The following year, McLaglen was the top-billed lead in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s legendary [[World War I]] classic ''[[What Price Glory? (1926 film)|What Price Glory?(1926)]]'' with [[Edmund Lowe]] and [[Dolores del Rio]], one of the most revered films about the war. (McLaglen and Lowe reprised their roles from the movie in the radio program ''Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt'', broadcast on the [[Blue Network]] September 28, 1941 - January 25, 1942, and on [[NBC]] February 13, 1942 - April 3, 1942.<ref name="dunningota">Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-507678-3. Pp. 136-137.</ref>) He made the transition to sound films with ease, memorably starring opposite [[Boris Karloff]]'s crazed religious fanatic in [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Lost Patrol (1934 film)|The Lost Patrol]]'' (1934), a picture about desperate soldiers gradually losing their minds fighting Arabs in the desert of what is now [[Iraq]].  Another highlight of his career was winning an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his role in Ford's ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]'' (1935), based on a novel by [[Liam O'Flaherty]]; [[Frank Tashlin]]'s 1938 [[cartoon]] ''[[Have You Got Any Castles?]]'' features a caricature of McLaglen emerging from the novel and literally informing someone about some shady characters. Arguably his most famous film apart from ''What Price Glory?'' remains ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' (1939) with [[Cary Grant]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], an adventure epic loosely based on [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem that served as the template decades later for ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984). McLaglen was later nominated for another Oscar, this time for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his role opposite [[John Wayne]] in ''[[The Quiet Man]]'' (1952). He was especially popular with director John Ford, who frequently included McLaglen in his films, earlier as leading man then later as comedy relief for films starring John Wayne. Toward the end of his career, McLaglen made several guest appearances on television, particularly in Western series such as ''[[Have Gun, Will Travel]]'' and ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''. The episodes of those series in which McLaglen guest-starred were both directed by his son, [[Andrew V. McLaglen]], who later became a [[film director]] frequently directing John Wayne.

===Personal life===
[[File:Lili Damita and Victor McLaglen.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Lili Damita]] in ''[[The Cock-Eyed World]]'' (1929)]]
In 1935 McLaglen spent a reported $40,000 to build his own stadium near [[Riverside Drive (Los Angeles)|Riverside Drive]] and Hyperion Avenue, near [[Griffith Park]] and the [[Atwater Village, Los Angeles|Atwater Village]] neighborhood of Los Angeles.  The stadium was used for soccer and many other activities.  The [[Los Angeles River]] [[Los Angeles flood of 1938|flood of 1938]] seriously damaged the stadium and it fell into disuse thereafter.<ref>Jim Thurman, [http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2013/12/los_angeles_sports_venues.php "10 L.A.

Victor McLaglen was the elder brother of the actor [[Cyril McLaglen]].

Victor McLaglen was married three times. His first marriage was to Enid Lamont in 1919. The couple had one daughter, Sheila, and one son, [[Andrew V. McLaglen|Andrew]]. Andrew McLaglen was a television and film director who worked on several film projects with John Wayne. Andrew's children, Mary and Josh McLaglen, are both film producers and directors. Sheila's daughter, [[Gwyneth Horder-Payton]], is a television director. Enid Lamont McLaglen died in 1942 as a result of a horse riding accident.

Victor McLaglen married twice more. His second marriage was to Suzanne M. Brueggeman. That marriage lasted from 1943 until 1948. His third and final marriage was to Margaret Pumphrey, whom he married in 1948.<ref>[[Time Magazine]], ''Milestones''</ref>  He remained married to Margaret, a [[Seattle]] socialite, until his death of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1959. He had by that time become a naturalized U.S. citizen. He was buried in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]].
