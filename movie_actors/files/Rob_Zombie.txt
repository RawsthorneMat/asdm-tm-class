He rose to prominence as a founding member of the band [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]] which formed in the mid-1980s and rose to fame in the early 1990s. As a solo artist, he has released five [[studio albums]], three [[compilation album]]s, two [[remix album]]s, two [[live album]]s, a [[video album]], and 15 [[Single (music)|single]]s. In 2003 he expanded his career and became a film director, and has directed a total of six films, the majority of which he also wrote or co-wrote. He has also released numerous brands of comic books, and appeared as an actor on numerous occasions.

White Zombie's debut album, ''[[Soul-Crusher]]'', was released in 1987 and was followed by their second album ''[[Make Them Die Slowly (album)|Make Them Die Slowly]]'' in 1989. They rose to prominence after the success of their third album, ''[[La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1]]'', and its lead single "[[Thunder Kiss '65]]" in 1993. The album went on to be certified multi-platinum by the [[RIAA]], for sales exceeding two million copies in the US. Their fourth and final studio album, ''[[Astro-Creep: 2000 – Songs of Love, Destruction and Other Synthetic Delusions of the Electric Head|Astro-Creep: 2000]]'', became their first top-10 entry on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and their second album to reach multi-platinum status.

Zombie began his solo career with the release of his 1998 debut album ''[[Hellbilly Deluxe]]''. The album was both a critical and commercial success, spawning three hit singles, reaching the Top 5 of the Billboard 200, and selling over three million copies worldwide. ''Hellbilly'' is Zombie's highest selling album to date. He followed the success of the album with ''[[The Sinister Urge (album)|The Sinister Urge]]'' in 2001, which had similar success to that of its predecessor. Zombie's first [[greatest hits]] album, ''[[Past, Present & Future (Rob Zombie album)|Past, Present & Future]]'', was released in 2003, and reached [[Platinum certification|Platinum]] status by the RIAA. His third studio album, ''[[Educated Horses]]'', was released in 2006, and was his third Top 10 entry on the Billboard 200. In 2010, he released his fourth studio album ''[[Hellbilly Deluxe 2]]'', which is a sequel to ''Hellbilly Deluxe''. His fifth album, ''[[Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor]]'', was released on April 23, 2013.

Following his success as a musician, Zombie began directing, writing and producing films. His first film, ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'', was completed in 2000, but numerous struggles with the distributor led to the film's release being delayed until 2003. Its sequel, ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' was released in 2005. In 2007, he released his third film, a remake of the 1978 classic film ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]''. The film went on to gross over $80 million, the highest-grossing film in the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]]. In 2009, Zombie released a sequel for the film, titled ''[[Halloween II (2009 film)|Halloween II]]''. In 2009, Zombie released his first animated film, ''[[The Haunted World of El Superbeasto]]'', based on his comic book series of the same name. His film ''[[The Lords of Salem (film)|The Lords of Salem]]'' was released in 2013. Zombie bought the rights to a film about the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] team [[Philadelphia Flyers]], titled ''The Broad Street Bullies'', though no release date for the film has been announced yet.
