'''Allene Ray''' (January 2, 1901 - May 5, 1979) was a motion pictures actress from [[San Antonio, Texas]], USA. She moved to [[Hollywood]] after winning a motion picture contest in 1920. In 1919, a producer visiting San Antonio met Ray and insisted she take a part in a film he was making. After this success her friends prevailed upon her to enter a contest held by one of the eastern USA magazine companies. Ray was the winner from a field of candidates selected from throughout the [[United States]].

Among her first screen credits are ''Honeymoon Ranch'' (1920), ''West of the Rio Grande'' (1921) and ''Partners of the Sunset'' (1922). The latter she made for the Lubin Corporation. In making ''[[The Fortieth Door]]'' (1924), Ray decided to wear a brunette wig as the film featured an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[heroine]]. The serial was made by [[Pathe Pictures]].

Her film career continued into the era of sound motion pictures with appearances in such films as ''[[The Indians Are Coming]]'' (1930), ''Westward Bound'' (1930) and ''[[The Phantom (1931 film)|The Phantom]]'' (1931). Ray played the role of a stowaway in ''Gun Cargo'' (1949).
