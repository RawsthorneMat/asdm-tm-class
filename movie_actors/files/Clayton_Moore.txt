'''Clayton Moore''' (September 14, 1914 – December 28, 1999) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] best known for playing the fictional western character the [[The Lone Ranger|Lone Ranger]] from 1949–1951 and 1954–1957 on the [[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|television series of the same name]].

==Early years==
Born '''Jack Carlton Moore''' in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], Moore became a [[circus]] acrobat by age 8 and appeared at the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago in 1934 with a trapeze act.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/29/arts/clayton-moore-television-s-lone-ranger-and-a-persistent-masked-man-dies-at-85.html?scp=1&sq=&pagewanted=1|title= Clayton Moore, Television's Lone Ranger And a Persistent Masked Man, Dies at 85|accessdate=2010-04-25 |work= [[New York Times]] |publisher= |date= 1999-12-29| first=Richard | last=Goldstein}}</ref> He graduated from Stephen K. Hayt Elementary School, Sullivan Junior High School and Senn High School on the far Northside of Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|title=Illinois Hall of Fame|url=http://illinoisstatesoceity.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/10/illinois_hall_o_109.html|publisher=Illinois State Society Of Washington, DC.|accessdate=16 March 2014}}</ref>

As a young man, Moore worked successfully as a [[John Robert Powers]] model. Moving to [[Hollywood]] in the late 1930s, he worked as a stunt man and bit player between modeling jobs. According to his 1996 autobiography ''I Was That Masked Man'', around 1940, Hollywood producer [[Edward Small]] persuaded him to adopt the stage name "Clayton" Moore. He was an occasional player in B westerns and the lead in four Republic Studio cliffhangers, and two for Columbia.  Moore served in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]] and made training films (''[[Target Invisible|Target--Invisible]]'', etc.) with the [[First Motion Picture Unit]].

==As the Lone Ranger==
Moore's career advanced in 1949, when George Trendle spotted him in the ''[[Ghost of Zorro]]'' serial.  As creator-producer of ''The Lone Ranger'' radio show (with writer [[Fran Striker]]), Trendle was about to launch the television version, and  Moore landed the role.

Moore trained his voice to sound like the [[radio]] version of The Lone Ranger, which had then been on the air since 1933, and succeeded in lowering his already distinctive baritone even further. With the first notes of Rossini's "[[William Tell Overture]]", Moore and co-star [[Jay Silverheels]], as the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] companion Tonto, made history as the stars of the first western written specifically for television. ''The Lone Ranger'' soon became the highest-rated program to that point on the fledgling [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network and its first true hit. It earned an [[Emmy Award]] nomination in 1950. Moore starred in 169 episodes of the series.<ref>''Ibid''.</ref>

The premise of ''The Lone Ranger'' is that all of the [[Texas Rangers Division|Texas Rangers]] except one, unidentified by name (and  later wearing a black mask), were massacred. The surviving Ranger and Tonto roam the [[Western United States|American West]] helping the downtrodden do battle with the lawless element wherever it is found. [[Glenn Strange]] in the early episodes played Butch Cavendish, the [[outlaw]] responsible for the massacre of the Rangers.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 102-103</ref>

===Leaving series===

After two successful years presenting a new episode every week, 52 weeks a year, Moore was fired and left the series, for reasons he never knew, according to his book ''I Was That Masked Man''. As "Clay Moore", he made a few more westerns and serials, sometimes playing the villain.  Moore was replaced  for the third season  by actor [[John Hart (actor)|John Hart]]. Eventually the producers of ''The Lone Ranger'' rehired Moore (it is believed that fan acceptance of Hart in the role was low), and he remained with the program until it ended first-run production in 1957. He and Jay Silverheels also starred in two [[feature film|feature-length]] ''Lone Ranger'' motion pictures. Moore appeared in other television series too, including a role in the 1952 episode "[[Snake River]] Trapper" of [[Bill Williams (actor)|Bill Williams]]'s [[Television syndication|syndicated]] western, ''[[The Adventures of Kit Carson]]''. He appeared twice on [[Jock Mahoney]]'s  syndicated western series, ''[[The Range Rider]]'', as Martin Wickett in "Ambush in Coyote Canyon" in 1952 and as Dan Meighan in "The Saga of Silver Town" in 1953.

After completion of the second feature, ''The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold'' in 1958, Moore embarked on what would be 40 years of personal appearances, TV guest spots, and classic commercials as the legendary masked man. Silverheels joined him for occasional reunions during the early 1960s.  Throughout his career, Moore expressed respect and love for Silverheels.

The Finale or "cavalry charge" of the [[The William Tell Overture]] by [[Gioachino Rossini]] was used as the theme music for The Lone Ranger in the movies, serials, television and on radio and for [[Lark (cigarette)]] television commercials in the 1960s. Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels appeared in [[Stan Freberg]]'s [[Pizza Rolls|Jeno's Pizza Rolls]] commercial.

===Lawsuit over public appearances===

In 1979, the owner of the Ranger character, [[Jack Wrather]], obtained a court order prohibiting Moore from making future appearances as The Lone Ranger.<ref>{{cite news|title= Who's That Masked Man? Hi-Yo-It's Clayton Moore!|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=1985-01-15|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1985-01-15/news/mn-7324_1_clayton-moore|accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref>  Wrather anticipated making a new film version of the story and did not want the value of the character being undercut by Moore's appearances.  Wrather did not want to encourage the belief that the 65-year-old Moore would be playing the role in the new picture.  This move proved to be a [[public relations]] disaster.  Moore responded by changing his costume slightly and replacing the [[Domino mask]] with similar-looking [[Foster Grant]] wraparound sunglasses, and by counter-suing Wrather.  He eventually won the suit, and was able to resume his appearances in costume, which he continued to do until shortly before his death.  For a time he worked in publicity tie-ins with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] baseball team. (Wrather's new motion picture of the character, ''[[The Legend of the Lone Ranger]]'', was released in 1981 and was a critical and commercial failure.)

Moore often was quoted as saying he had "fallen in love with the Lone Ranger character" and strove in his personal life to take The Lone Ranger Creed to heart.  This, coupled with his public fight to retain the right to wear the mask, linked him inextricably with the character.  In this regard, he was much like another cowboy star, [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]], who portrayed the [[Hopalong Cassidy]] character. Moore was so identified with the masked man that he is the only person on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, to have his character's name along with his on the star, which reads, "Clayton Moore &mdash; The Lone Ranger".  He was inducted into the Stuntman's Hall of Fame in 1982 and in 1990 was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. Moore also was awarded a place on the Western Walk of Fame in Old Town [[Newhall, California]].

==Death==
Clayton Moore died on December 28, 1999, in a [[West Hills, California|West Hills]], [[California]], hospital after suffering a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at his home in nearby [[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]].  He was survived by his fourth wife, Clarita Moore, and an adopted daughter, Dawn Angela Moore.  Moore was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]].<ref name="independent">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/1999/SHOWBIZ/TV/12/28/obit.moore/index.html|title=Clayton Moore, the 'Lone Ranger,' dead at 85 |accessdate=2009-10-19 |work= [[CNN]] |publisher= |date= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-clayton-moore-1135066.html|title= Obituary: Clayton Moore|accessdate=2009-10-19 |work= [[The Independent]] |publisher= |date= 1999-12-30| location=London | first=Tom | last=Vallance}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/29/news/mn-48531
