==Biography==

===Youth and education===
He was born in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], to George and Frances Walter, who named him '''Sterling Relyea Walter'''.<ref name=wanderer/><ref name=census/> After his father died, he was adopted at age 9 by James Hayden and renamed '''Sterling Walter Hayden'''. He grew up in coastal towns of [[New England]],<ref name=blade/> and as a child lived in [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Pennsylvania]], Washington, D.C., and [[Maine]], where he attended Wassookeag School in [[Dexter, Maine]].

Hayden dropped out of high school at the age of 16 and took a job as mate on a schooner.<ref name=nytobit/> His first voyage was to [[Newport Beach]], California, from [[New London, Connecticut]].<ref name=blade/> Later, he was a fisherman on the [[Grand Banks]] of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], ran a charter yacht, and served as a fireman on 11 trips to [[Cuba]] aboard a steamer.<ref name=blade/> He [[Skipper (boating)|skippered]] a trading schooner in the [[Caribbean]] after earning his [[Master mariner|master's license]], and in 1937 he served as mate on a world cruise of the schooner ''[[Brigantine Yankee|Yankee]]''.<ref name=blade/> After serving as sailor and fireman on larger [[merchant ship|vessels]] and sailing around the world several times, he was awarded his first command at age 22, skippering the [[square rigger]] ''Florence C. Robinson'' 7,700 miles from [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]], to [[Tahiti]] in 1938.<ref name=blade/><ref name=wanderer225/><ref>"New in the News", [http://books.google.com/books?id=q-C9Opx76o0C&lpg=PA25&dq=%22Sterling%20Hayden%22&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Boy's Life''], Feb 1939, p. 25</ref> Hayden spoke of his nautical experiences before the monthly meeting of the [[Adventurers' Club of New York]] on March 21, 1940.<ref>"Report of the March Meeting." ''The Adventurer'', April 1940.</ref>

===Hollywood years and military service===
Hayden became a print model and later signed a contract with [[Paramount Pictures]], who dubbed the 6′5″ (1.96 m)<ref name=wanderer224/> actor "The Most Beautiful Man in the Movies" and "The Beautiful Blond Viking God." His first film, ''[[Virginia (1941 film)|Virginia]]'' (1941), starred [[Madeleine Carroll]], with whom he fell in love and married.

After two film roles, he left Hollywood and joined the U.S. Marine Corps as a private, under the name John Hamilton, a [[nom de guerre]] he never used otherwise. While at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]], he was recommended for [[Officer Candidate School]]. After graduation, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and was transferred to service as an undercover agent with [[William J. Donovan]]'s [[Office of the Coordinator of Information|COI]] office. He remained there after it became the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]].<ref name=cnnspies/><ref name=usnews/><ref name=SchuonK-USMCBD />

As OSS agent '''John Hamilton''', his [[World War II]] service included sailing with supplies from Italy to [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav partisans]] and parachuting into [[Nazi Croatia|fascist Croatia]]. Hayden, who also participated in the Naples–Foggia campaign and established air crew rescue teams in enemy-occupied territory, became a first lieutenant on September 13, 1944, and a captain on February 14, 1945. He received the [[Silver Star]] (for gallantry in action in the Balkans and Mediterranean; ''"Lt. Hamilton displayed great courage in making hazardous sea voyages in enemy-infested waters and reconnaissance through enemy-held areas"''), a [[Arrowhead device|Bronze Arrowhead device]] for parachuting behind enemy lines, and a commendation from Yugoslavia's [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]]. He left active duty on December 24, 1945.<ref name=SchuonK-USMCBD/>

His great admiration for the bravery of the Communist partisans led to a brief membership in the [[Communist Party]]. He was apparently active in supporting an effort by the Communist-controlled motion picture painters union to absorb other film industry unions.<ref>Meroney, John, [http://www.latimesmagazine.com/2012/02/left-in-the-past.html "Left in the Past"], LA ''Times Magazine'', February 2012.</ref> As the [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] deepened in U.S., he cooperated with the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], confessing his brief Communist ties and "naming names."<ref name=wanderer/> His wife at that time, Betty de Noon, insisted that the names her ex-husband provided were already in the hands of the committee, which had a copy of the Communist Party's membership list. In any event, Hayden subsequently repudiated his cooperation with the committee, stating in his autobiography, "I don't think you have the foggiest notion of the contempt I have had for myself since the day I did that thing."<ref name=wanderer/>

===Personal life===
Hayden often professed distaste for film acting, claiming he did it mainly to pay for his ships and voyages. 

In 1958, after a bitter divorce from Betty Ann de Noon, Hayden was awarded custody of his children. He defied a court order and sailed to [[Tahiti]] with all four children, Christian, Dana, Gretchen and Matthew.<ref name="TIME-February 9, 1959">{{cite news

The crew sailed from San Francisco Bay to Tahiti, where Hayden had planned to film a movie. Hayden also invited well-known photographer [[Dody Weston Thompson]] along to document the trip and to help shoot location choices. Her South Seas folio contains photographs of Hayden's ship, ''The Wanderer''; on-deck photos of life aboard the ship; colorful prints of his children, Tahitian women and children; and unique artifacts on shore. The film never materialized however, according to Dody's notes, ''[[Travel + Leisure|U.S. Camera and Travel]]'' printed her photographs of paradise in 1961. [[Marin County]] Superior Court Judge [[Harold Haley]] later ordered Hayden to repay [[Republic Pictures]] nearly $50,000 to recover the cost of financing the trip.<ref>{{cite news |title=Film Actor Handed $49,518 Judgment |first= |last= |authorlink= |author2= |author3= |author4= |author5= |author6= |author7= |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=chUrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=k5wFAAAAIBAJ&dq=harold-haley%20marin&pg=3499%2C1610060 |format= |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]] |publisher=|location=[[Reading, Pennsylvania]]  |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=August 6, 1961 |page=12 |pages= |at= |accessdate=July 6, 2010 |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |ref= }}</ref> 

In 1960, he married Catherine Devine McConnell. They had two sons, Andrew and David, and were married until his death in 1986. McConnell also had a son from her first marriage, to journalist [[Scott McConnell]].

In the early 1960s, Hayden rented one of the pilot houses of the retired ferryboat ''[[Berkeley (ferryboat)|Berkeley]]'', docked in [[Sausalito, California]] where he resided while writing his autobiography ''Wanderer'', which was first published in 1963. In it, he reminisces about turning points in his life:
:"The sun beats down and you pace, you pace and you pace. Your mind flies free and you see yourself as an actor, condemned to a treadmill wherein men and women conspire to breathe life into a screenplay that allegedly depicts life as it was in the old wild West. You see yourself coming awake any one of a thousand mornings between the spring of 1954, and that of 1958 ‑ alone in a double bed in a big white house deep in suburban Sherman Oaks, not far from Hollywood.

:"The windows are open wide, and beyond these is the backyard swimming pool inert and green, within a picket fence. You turn and gaze at a pair of desks not far from the double bed. This is your private office, the place that shelters your fondest hopes: these desks so neat, patiently waiting for the day that never comes, the day you'll sit down at last and begin to write.

:"Why did you never write? Why, instead, did you grovel along, through the endless months and years, as a motion‑picture actor? What held you to it, to something you so vehemently professed to despise? Could it be that you secretly liked it—that the big dough and the big house and the high life meant more than the aura you spun for those around you to see?

:"'Hayden's wild,' they said. 'He's kind of nuts‑but you've got to hand it to him. He doesn't give a damn about the loot or the stardom or things like that—something to do with his seafaring, or maybe what he went through in the war . . .'"<ref name=wanderer/>{{rp|151}}

In the 1970s, after his appearance in ''[[The Godfather]]'', he appeared several times on NBC's ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|Tomorrow Show]]'' with [[Tom Snyder]], where he talked about his career resurgence and how it had funded his travels and adventures around the world. Hayden bought a canal barge in the Netherlands in 1969, eventually moving it to the heart of Paris and living on it part of the time. He also shared a home in [[Wilton, Connecticut]] with his family and had an apartment in Sausalito.

Hayden wrote two acclaimed books: an autobiography, ''Wanderer'' (1962), and a novel ''Voyage'' (1976).

Sterling Hayden died of [[prostate cancer]] in Sausalito in 1986, age 70.<ref name=nytobit/>

In the film ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'' (Sydney Pollack, 1975), two veteran CIA officers were reminiscing about their past.  Higgins ([[Cliff Robertson]]) asked Mr. Wabash, "You served with Col. Donovan in the OSS, didn't you, sir?"  Wabash ([[John Houseman]]) replies, "I sailed the Adriatic with a movie star at the helm.  It doesn't seem like much of a war now, but it was."
