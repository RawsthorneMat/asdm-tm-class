'''Richard Stuart Linklater''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|l|eɪ|t|ər}}; born July 30, 1960)<ref>According to the State of Texas. ''Texas Birth Index, 1903–1997''. At Ancestry.com</ref> is an American film director and screenwriter. He is known for the coming of age comedy ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'' (1993), the romantic drama film trilogy ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' (1995),  ''[[Before Sunset]]'' (2004) and ''[[Before Midnight (film)|Before Midnight]]'' (2013);  the music-themed comedy ''[[School of Rock]]'' (2003), the [[rotoscope]] animated ''[[Waking Life]]'' (2001) and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (2006). From 2002-2014, he filmed ''[[Boyhood (film)|Boyhood]]'' (2014), a passion project over twelve years. Receiving universal acclaim, Linklater won the [[Golden Globes|Golden Globe]], [[Critics' Choice Movie Awards]] and [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]]s for Best Director and Best Picture. He also received his first nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]], along with nominations for Original Screenplay and Picture.

Many of his films are noted for their loosely structured narrative; two of his projects – The ''Before...'' films and ''Boyhood'' – feature the same actors filmed over an extended period of years. He is known for working with actors [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Jack Black]] in many of his films.

==Early life==
Linklater was born in [[Houston, Texas]], the son of Diane Margaret (née Krieger), who taught at [[Sam Houston State University]], and Charles W. Linklater, III.<ref>https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/VD5S-BGQ</ref><ref>http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11287806</ref> He attended Huntsville High School in [[Huntsville, Texas]], during grades 9-11, and finished  at [[Bellaire High School (Bellaire, Texas)|Bellaire High School]] in [[Bellaire, Texas]] for his senior year. Linklater studied at [[Sam Houston State University]], dropping out to work on an off-shore [[drilling rig|oil rig]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. He frequently read novels on the rig and, upon returning to land, developed a love of film through repeated visits to a repertory theater in Houston. At this point, Linklater realized he wanted to be a filmmaker. He used his savings to buy a [[Super 8 mm film|Super-8]] camera, a projector, and editing equipment, and moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. He was influenced by [[Robert Bresson]], [[Yasujiro Ozu]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Josef Von Sternberg]], and [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} He enrolled in [[Austin Community College]] in the fall of 1984 to study film.<ref name="slackers">Alison Macor. ''Chainsaws, Slackers, and Spy Kids 30 Years of Filmmaking in Austin, Texas'' University of Texas Press: Austin, 2010.</ref> Since his early 20s, Linklater has been a [[vegetarian]]. In 2015, he explained the dietary lifestyle in a ''Boyhood-''style documentary for [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]].<ref>Robert Philpot, "[http://www.star-telegram.com/living/article10554395.html# Richard Linklater Does ‘Veghood’ for PETA]," ''Star-Telegram'', 17 February 2015.</ref>

==Career==

===Austin Film Society===
Linklater founded the [[Austin Film Society]] in 1985 together with his frequent collaborator [[Lee Daniel]]. One of the mentors for the Film Society was former New York City critic for the ''Soho Weekly News'' George Morris who had relocated to Austin and taught film there. Morris had previously written articles on [[Leo McCarey]], [[Vincente Minnelli]], [[George Sidney]], and [[Douglas Sirk]].

===Early directing===
For several years, Linklater made many short films that were exercises and experiments in film techniques. He finally completed his first feature, the rarely seen ''[[It's Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books]]'' (which is now available in the Criterion Collection edition of ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]''), a Super-8 feature that took a year to shoot and another year to edit. The film is significant in the sense that it establishes most of Linklater's preoccupations. The film has his trademark style of minimal camera movements and lack of narrative, while it examines the theme of traveling with no real particular direction in mind. These idiosyncrasies would be explored in greater detail in future projects. To this end Linklater created Detour Filmproduction (an homage to the [[Detour (1945 film)|1945 low budget]] [[film noir]] by [[Edgar G. Ulmer]]), and subsequently made ''Slacker'' for only $23,000. It went on to gross more than $1.25 million. The film is an aimless day in the life of the city of Austin, Texas showcasing its more eccentric characters.

Inspiration for Linklater's work was largely based on his experience viewing the film [[Raging Bull (film)|''Raging Bull'']], Linklater told [[Robert K. Elder]] in an interview for ''[[The Film That Changed My Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556528256/ref=nosim/wwwrobelderco-20 |title=The Film That Changed My Life: 30 Directors on Their Epiphanies in the Dark |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}</ref>

<blockquote>It made me see movies as a potential outlet for what I was thinking about and hoping to express. At that point I was an unformed artist. At that moment, something was simmering in me, but ''Raging Bull'' brought it to a boil.<ref>Linklater, Richard. Interview by Robert K. Elder. The Film That Changed My Life. By Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p197. Print.</ref></blockquote>

While gaining a cult following in the [[independent film]] world, he made his second film, ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', based on his years at Huntsville High School and the people he encountered there. The film garnered critical praise and grossed $8 million in the United States while becoming a hit on VHS. This film was also responsible for the breakout of fellow Texas native [[Matthew McConaughey]]. In 1995, Linklater won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] for the film ''[[Before Sunrise]]'' at the [[45th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1995/03_preistr_ger_1995/03_Preistraeger_1995.html |title=Berlinale: 1995 Prize Winners |accessdate=2011-12-30 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> His next feature, ''[[subUrbia (film)|subUrbia]]'', had mixed reviews critically, and did very poorly at the box office. In 1996, Linklater lent his voice to the critically acclaimed animated feature ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]''. In 1998, he took on his first Hollywood feature, ''[[The Newton Boys]]'', which received mixed reviews while tanking at the box office.

===21st century===
With the rotoscope films ''[[Waking Life]]'', and ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'', and his mainstream comedies, ''[[School of Rock]]'' and the remake of ''[[Bad News Bears]]'', he gained wider recognition. In 2003, he wrote and directed a pilot for [[HBO]] with [[Rodney Rothman]] called ''$5.15/hr'', about several [[minimum wage]] restaurant workers. The pilot deals with themes later examined in ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]''. In 2004, the British television network Channel 4 produced a major documentary about Linklater, in which the filmmaker frankly discussed the personal and philosophical ideas behind his films. "St Richard of Austin" was presented by Ben Lewis and directed by [[Irshad Ashraf]] and broadcast on Channel 4 in December 2004 in the UK. In 2005, Linklater was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for his film ''[[Before Sunset]]''.

Many of Linklater's films take place in one day, a narrative approach that has gained popularity in recent years. ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]'', ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'', ''[[Tape (film)|Tape]]'', ''[[Before Sunrise]]'', ''Before Sunset'', and ''[[Before Midnight (film)|Before Midnight]]'' are examples of this method. Two of his films, (''A Scanner Darkly'' and ''Waking Life''), used [[rotoscoping]] animation techniques. Working with [[Bob Sabiston]] and Sabiston's program [[Rotoshop]] to create this effect, Linklater shot and edited both movies completely as live action features, then employed a team of artists to "trace over" individual frames. The result is a distinctive "semi-real" quality, praised by such critics as [[Roger Ebert]] (in the case of ''Waking Life'') as being original and well-suited to the aims of the film.

''Fast Food Nation'' (2006) is an adaptation of the best selling book that examines the local and global influence of the United States fast food industry. The film was entered into the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4360399/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Fast Food Nation |accessdate=2009-12-13|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> before being released in North America on November 17, 2006 and in Europe on March 23, 2007. After releasing ''Fast Food Nation'' to mixed reviews, Linklater returned to form as a critical darling with ''[[A Scanner Darkly (film)|A Scanner Darkly]]'' (released in the same year), 2009's ''[[Me and Orson Welles]]'' garnering an 85% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], and 2012's ''[[Bernie (2011 film)|Bernie]]'' receiving a 91% rating.<ref name="Linklater Rotten Tomatoes">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/richard_linklater |title=Rotten Tomatoes: Richard Linklater |accessdate=2009-12-13|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>

In 2014 he released a film in the making for 12 years titled ''[[Boyhood (film)|Boyhood]]'', which received overwhelming critical acclaim. It is the only film released in the 21st century to have received a perfect 100 score from review-aggregator [[metacritic]].<ref name="Boyhood">[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/boyhood Boyhood]. Metacritic.</ref> His daughter [[Lorelei Linklater]] co-stars in the film as the sister of the central character. For a while Linklater was attached to direct a remake of ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]'' for Warner Brothers.<ref name=talkinabout>{{cite web|last1=Fischer|first1=Russ|title=Richard Linklater Leaves 'The Incredible Mr. Limpet' to Focus on 'That's What I'm Talking About'|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/linklater-leaves-limpet/|website=/Film|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref> In 2014, however, he dropped the project in favor of working on a spiritual successor to ''Dazed and Confused'', titled ''[[That's What I'm Talking About (film)|That's What I'm Talking About]]'',<ref name=talkinabout/> with backing from [[Annapurna Pictures]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] distributing the film in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/megan-ellisons-annapurna-to-produce-richard-linklaters-dazed-spiritual-sequel-thats-what-im-talking-about|title=Megan Ellison's Annapurna to produce Richard Linklater's 'Dazed' spiritual Sequel, 'That's What I'm Talking About's|last=Patches|first=Matt|date=September 30, 2014|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref>

Despite the popularity of many of his films and having directed multiple high-paying Hollywood productions, Linklater remains in Austin, Texas and refuses to live or work in Hollywood for any extended period of time. Linklater is known for using the same actors in many of his films including [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Jack Black]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Julie Delpy]] and [[Patricia Arquette]]. ''21 Years: Richard Linklater'', a documentary about Linklater, is scheduled to debut in 2014 November at the [[Denver Film Festival]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3657420/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ov_inf+ 21 Years: Richard Linklater (2014) - Release Info] at the IMDB. Retrieved 2014 October 7.</ref>

He is also attached to direct to ''Where'd You Go Bernadette?'', produced by [[Annapurna Pictures]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Tatiana Siegel|last2=Kit|first2=Borys|title=Richard Linklater in Talks to Direct 'Where'd You Go, Bernadette' (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/richard-linklater-talks-direct-whered-777688|accessdate=February 28, 2015|publisher=hollywoodreporter.com|date=February 26, 2015}}</ref>

==Significance==
In the early 1990s, ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]'' was widely considered an accurate depiction of [[Generation X]] because the film's young adult characters are more interested in quasi-intellectual pastimes and socializing than career advancement.<ref>Richard Linklater, ''Slacker'', St Martins Griffin, 1992.</ref> However, Linklater has long since eschewed the role of generational spokesperson and is ironically a [[Baby boomer|"Baby Boomer"]] himself. Moreover, the movie actually includes various generations, and many of its themes are universal rather than generation-specific.<ref>Lesley Speed, "The Possibilities of Roads Not Taken", ''Journal of Popular Film & Television'', vol. 35, no. 3, Fall 2007, p. 103.</ref>

Those of Linklater's films that have non-formulaic narratives about seemingly random occurrences, often spanning about twenty-four hours, have been hailed as alternatives to contemporary Hollywood market-driven blockbusters. In conjunction with these unorthodox narratives, the emphasis on philosophical talk over physical action in ''Slacker'' and ''[[Waking Life]]'' aligns Linklater's work with art cinema traditions, particularly those of Europe, from which much recent American cinema is estranged.<ref>Speed, p. 103.</ref>
