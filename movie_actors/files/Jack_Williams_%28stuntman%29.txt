Williams owed his success to his horse Coco. "Coco bought the ranch," he said, referring to the horse he rode in many of his most famous scenes. Williams was best known for having trained his horse to fall dramatically on cue at a given spot as if it had taken a bullet or arrow.

==A horse named Coco==

Williams was inspired by his father, George Williams, a Montana cowboy who could train a horse to fall on cue. Jack recalled, "There was probably no feat I could have imagined that was as fascinating as that. So I took the technique and perfected it."<ref> Peeples, Stephen K. ''Stunt Double Enjoys Newfound Tranquility'' ''Santa Clarita Signal'' April 25, 2005</ref>

"He was the top falling-horse stuntman in the business," said stuntman Bob Hoy, who first worked with Williams in 1950. "He had a great horse called Coco, and they were inseparable. The horse had an instinct. A lot of horses will fight you when you get to the spot where they'll make the fall and won't go there. But Coco went there. She was just so great."

Said stuntman Joe Canutt: "You can get great falls a lot of times out of horses, but when you're attacking the Alamo, for example, and you've got bombs and cannons going off ... some of them don't work at all. That mare [Coco] consistently got spectacular falls."

But beyond doing the falling-horse stunt, Hoy said, "Jack drove stagecoaches, he wrecked wagons, he could transfer from the horse to the train -- he could do anything pertaining to horse work."<ref>McLellan</ref>

Coco died at age 33 and was buried on Williams' California ranch.

==Quotes==
"As a stuntman, life's an adventure," he said. "It's marvelous, but so fragile. You remember in 'The War Wagon' where they've got the dynamite shaking and it could go off any second? That's the way life is."
