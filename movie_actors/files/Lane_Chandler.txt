'''Lane Chandler''' (June 4, 1899 – September 14, 1972) was an American [[actor]] specializing in [[Western (genre)|Westerns]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born as '''Robert Chandler Oakes''' on a ranch near [[Culbertson, Montana]], the son of a horse rancher. At an early age, the family relocated to [[Helena, Montana]], where he graduated from high school. He briefly attended Montana Wesleyan College (which later merged and became part of [[Rocky Mountain College]]), but quit to drive a [[tour bus]] at [[Yellowstone National Park]].

===Career===
In the early 1920s he moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], and started working as an auto mechanic. His real-life experiences growing up on a horse ranch landed him [[bit part]]s in westerns from 1925, for [[Paramount Pictures]]. Studio executives suggested changing his name to Lane Chandler, and as such he began achieving [[Leading actor|leading roles]] opposite stars like [[Clara Bow]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Betty Bronson]] and [[Esther Ralston]]. His first lead role was in ''[[The Legion of the Condemned]]''.

As a [[silent film]] star Chandler performed well, but when [[Sound film|talkies]] arrived he was cast more in [[Supporting actor|supporting roles]], as in ''[[The Great Mike]]'' of 1944. He starred in a few low-budget westerns in the 1930s, but was more often cast as the leading man's partner, or saddle pal, or a sheriff or army officer.  With the advent of [[television]] Chandler began making appearance on numerous series, often making appearances in Westerns such as ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok]]'', ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''. He continued acting on TV and in films through 1966, retiring comfortably due to his holdings in both residential and commercial properties. 

He died in Los Angeles of [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] in 1972, aged 73.
