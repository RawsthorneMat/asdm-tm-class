'''Woodward Maurice Ritter''' (January 12, 1905 &ndash; January 2, 1974), better known as '''Tex Ritter''', was an American [[country music]] singer and movie actor popular from the mid-1930s into the 1960s, and the patriarch of the Ritter family in acting (son [[John Ritter|John]] and grandsons [[Jason Ritter|Jason]] and [[Tyler Ritter|Tyler]]). He is a member of the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Ritter was born in [[Murvaul, Texas|Murvaul]], [[Texas]], the son of Martha Elizabeth (n√©e Matthews) and [[German American]] James Everett Ritter. He grew up on his family's farm in [[Panola County, Texas|Panola County]] and attended grade school in [[Carthage, Texas|Carthage]]. He attended South Park High School in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], Texas. After graduating with honors, he entered the [[University of Texas at Austin]]; he studied pre-law and majored in government, political science, and economics.

==Career==

===Radio and Broadway===
An early pioneer of country music, Ritter soon became interested in show business. In 1928, he sang on [[KPRC (AM)|KPRC-AM]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], a 30-minute program of mostly cowboy songs. That same year, he moved to [[New York City]] and landed a job in the men's chorus of the [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] show, ''[[The New Moon]]'' (1928). He appeared as cowboy Cord Elam in the Broadway production ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'' (1931), the basis for the musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]''. He also played the part of Sagebrush Charlie in ''The Round Up'' (1932) and ''[[Mother Lode]]'' (1934).

In 1932, he starred in New York City's first broadcast Western, ''The Lone Star Rangers'' on [[WOR (AM)|WOR-AM]], where he sang and told tales of the [[Old West]]. Ritter wrote and starred in ''Cowboy Tom's Roundup'' on [[WINS (AM)|WINS-AM]] in 1933, a daily children's cowboy program aired over two other [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] stations for three years. He also performed on the radio show ''[[WHN]] Barndance'' and sang on [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]] shows; and appeared in several radio dramas, including [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS's]] ''Bobby Benson's Adventures''.

Ritter was also cast in guest-starring roles on the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]], ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', and the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] western series, ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'', starring [[Nick Adams (actor)|Nick Adams]] as a wandering former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]].

Ritter began recording for American Record Company ([[Columbia Records]]) in 1933. His first release was "Goodbye Ole Paint". He also recorded "Rye Whiskey" for the label. In 1935, he signed with [[Decca Records]], where he recorded his first original recordings, "[[Sam Hall (song)|Sam Hall]]" and "[[Whoopie Ti Yi Yo]]". He recorded 29 songs for Decca, the last in 1939 in Los Angeles as part of Tex Ritter and His Texans.

===Movies===
In 1936, Ritter moved to Los Angeles. His motion picture debut was in ''[[Song of the Gringo]]'' (1936) for [[Grand National Pictures]]. He starred in twelve [[B-movie]] [[Western movie|Westerns]] for Grand National, including ''[[Headin' for the Rio Grande]]'' ([[1936 in film|1936]]), and ''[[Trouble in Texas]]'' (1937) co-starring [[Rita Hayworth]] (then known as Rita Cansino).

After starring in ''[[Utah Trail]]'' (1938), Ritter left financially troubled Grand National. Between 1938 and 1945, he starred in around forty "[[singing cowboy]]" movies. He made four movies with actress [[Dorothy Fay]] at [[Monogram Pictures]]: ''[[Song of the Buckaroo]]'' ([[1938 in film|1938]]), ''[[Sundown on the Prairie]]'' (1939), ''[[Rollin' Westward]]'' (1939) and ''[[Rainbow Over the Range]]'' (1940).

Ritter then moved to [[Universal Pictures]] and teamed with [[Johnny Mack Brown]] for films such as ''[[The Lone Star Trail]]'' (1943), ''[[Raiders of San Joaquin]] (1943)'', ''[[Cheyenne Roundup]]'' (1943) and  ''The Old Chisholm Trail'' (1942). He was also the star of the films ''[[Arizona Trail (film)|Arizona Trail]]'' (1943), ''[[Marshal of Gunsmoke]]'' (1944) and ''[[Oklahoma Raiders]]'' (1944).

When Universal developed financial difficulties, Ritter moved to [[Producers Releasing Corporation]] as "Texas Ranger Tex Haines" for eight features between 1944 and 1945. Ritter did not return to acting until 1950, playing mostly supporting roles or appearing as himself.

===Recording===
Ritter's recording career was his most successful period. He was the first artist signed with the newly formed [[Capitol Records]] as well as its first Western singer. His first recording session was on June 11, 1942.

In 1944, he scored a hit with "[[I'm Wastin' My Tears on You]]", which hit No. 1 on the country chart and eleven on the pop chart. "[[There's a New Moon Over My Shoulder]]" was a country chart No. 2 and pop chart No. 21. In 1945, he had the No. 1, 2, and 3 songs on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard's]]'' Most Played Jukebox Folk Records poll, a first in the industry. Between 1945 and 1946, he registered seven consecutive top five hits, including "[[You Two-Timed Me One Time Too Often]]" (No. 1) written by [[Jenny Lou Carson]], which spent eleven weeks on the charts. In 1948, "Rye Whiskey" and his cover of "[[The Deck of Cards]]" both made the top ten and "Pecos Bill" reached No. 15. In 1950, "Daddy's Last Letter (Private First Class John H. McCormick)" also became a hit.

Ritter first toured Europe in 1952, where his appearances included a starring role in the ''Texas Western Spectacle'' at London's [[Harringay Arena]].  That [[1952 in film|same year]], Ritter recorded the movie title-track song "[[High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darlin')]]", which became a hit. At the first televised [[Academy Awards]] ceremony in 1953, he sang "High Noon", which received an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Song]] that year.<ref>[http://users.pandora.be/davidneale/elvis/originals/list3.html#S27995 ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref>

In 1953, he began performing on ''[[Town Hall Party]]'' on radio and television in Los Angeles. In 1957 he co-hosted ''[[Town Hall Party#Ranch Party|Ranch Party]]'', a syndicated version of the show. He made his national TV debut in 1955 on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' and was one of five rotating hosts for its 1961 NBC-TV spin-off, ''[[Five Star Jubilee]]''.

He formed Vidor Publications, Inc., a music publishing firm, with [[Johnny Bond]], in 1955. "[[Remember the Alamo (song)|Remember the Alamo]]" was the first song in the catalog. In 1957, he released his first album, ''Songs From the Western Screen''. He was often featured in archival footage on the children's television program, ''[[The Gabby Hayes Show]]''.

In 1961, he hit the charts with "I Dreamed Of A Hill-Billy Heaven," which had actually been released six years earlier by [[Eddie Dean (singer)|Eddie Dean]].

===Later work===
Even  after the peak of his performing career, Ritter was recognized for his contributions to country music and artistic versatility. He became one of the founding members of the [[Country Music Association]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and spearheaded the effort to build the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. In 1964, he became the fifth inductee and first singing cowboy to be honored by the Country Music Hall of Fame.

He moved to Nashville in 1965 and began working for [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] Radio and the [[Grand Ole Opry]], earning a lifetime membership in the latter. His family remained in California temporarily so that son John could finish high school there. For a time, Dorothy was an official greeter at the Opry. During this period, Ritter co-hosted a late night radio program with country disc jockey [[Ralph Emery]]. His 1967 single "Just Beyond The Moon" with lyrics by [[Jeremy Slate]] hit No. 3 on the country chart.

===Senate campaign===
In 1970, Ritter surprised many people by entering Tennessee's [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] [[primary election]] for [[United States Senate]]. Despite high name recognition, he lost overwhelmingly to [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] [[Bill Brock]], who then defeated the incumbent Senator [[Albert Gore, Sr.]] in the [[general election]].

==Personal life==
Ritter was married to actress [[Dorothy Fay]] on June 14, 1941, until his death. The couple had two sons, Thomas Ritter and actor [[John Ritter]]. Tex helped start [[United Cerebral Palsy]] after Thomas was found to have the affliction. Ritter and his sons spent a great deal of time raising money and public awareness to help others with the illness. He is also the grandfather of [[Jason Ritter]].

==Death==
[[File:Tex Ritter grave marker Port Neches Texas.jpg|130px|thumb|right|Ritter's grave marker in [[Port Neches, Texas|Port Neches]] in [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]], [[Texas]]]]

In 1974, he had a heart attack and died in Nashville, ten days before his 69th birthday.

His last hit record was a cover of Gordon Sinclair's famous editorial "[[The Americans (commentary)|The Americans (A Canadian's Opinion)]]".  It reached No. 35 on the country chart shortly after his death. He is interred at Oak Bluff Memorial Park in [[Port Neches, Texas|Port Neches]] in [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]], Texas. Son John is interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Hollywood Hills, California|Hollywood Hills]], California.

==Legacy==

For his contribution to the recording industry, Ritter has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6631 Hollywood Boulevard; he and John Ritter were the first father-and-son pair to be so honored in different categories.  In 1980, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. There is Museum named for him in Carthage, Panola County, Texas and he was one of the first to be installed in the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame, also in Carthage.

Ritter can be heard as the voice of Big Al, an audio-animatronic bear at the [[Country Bear Jamboree]] attraction in the [[Magic Kingdom]] at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]]. His character sings "Blood On The Saddle" and continues through the finale as the rest of the cast attempts to drown him out.
