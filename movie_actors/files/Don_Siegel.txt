'''Donald Siegel''' (October 26, 1912 – April 20, 1991) was an American film director and producer. His name variously appeared in the credits of his films as both '''Don Siegel''' and '''Donald Siegel'''.  He is best known for the original sci-fi film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956), as well as five films with [[Clint Eastwood]], including the police thriller ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971) and the prison drama ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]'' (1979), and [[John Wayne]]'s final picture, the 1976 Western ''[[The Shootist]]''.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago, with [[Jewish]] origins, he attended schools in New York and later graduated from [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] in England.<ref name="Munn75">Munn, p. 75</ref> For a short time he studied at Beaux Arts in Paris, France, but left at age 20 and later made his way to Los Angeles.<ref name="Munn75"/>

==Career==
Siegel found work in the [[Warner Bros.]] film library after meeting producer [[Hal Wallis]],<ref name="Munn75"/> and later rose to head of the Montage Department, where he directed thousands of [[montage sequence|montages]], including the opening montage for ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''. In 1945 two shorts he directed, ''[[Hitler Lives?]]'' and ''[[Star in the Night]],'' won [[Academy Award]]s, which launched his career as a feature director.

He directed whatever material came his way, often transcending the limitations of budget and script to produce interesting and adept works. He made the original ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' in 1956. He directed two episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', "[[The Self-Improvement of Salvadore Ross]]" and "[[Uncle Simon]]".  He worked with [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Dolores del Río]] in ''[[Flaming Star]]'' (1960), with [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] in ''[[Hell Is for Heroes (film)|Hell Is for Heroes]]'' and [[Lee Marvin]] in the influential ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (1964) before directing a series of five films with [[Clint Eastwood]] that were commercially successful in addition to being well received by critics. These included the ''policiers'' ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'' and ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', the [[Albert Maltz]]-scripted Western ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'', the cynical [[American Civil War]] melodrama ''[[The Beguiled]]'' and the prison-break picture ''[[Escape from Alcatraz (film)|Escape from Alcatraz]]''. He was a considerable influence on Eastwood's own career as a director, and Eastwood's film ''[[Unforgiven]]'' is dedicated "for Don and [[Sergio Leone|Sergio]]".

He had a long collaboration with composer [[Lalo Schifrin]], who scored five of his films: ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'', ''[[The Beguiled]]'', ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', ''[[Charley Varrick]]'' and ''[[Telefon (film)|Telefon]]''.

Schifrin composed and recorded what would have been his sixth score for Siegel on ''[[Jinxed!]]'' (1982), but it was rejected by the studio despite Siegel's objections. This was one of several fights Siegel had on this, his last film.<ref>''Reported by the [[Los Angeles Times]] in 1982.''</ref>

Siegel was also important to the career of director [[Sam Peckinpah]]. In 1954, Peckinpah was hired as a dialogue coach for ''[[Riot in Cell Block 11]]''. His job entailed acting as an assistant to the director, Siegel. The film was shot on location at [[Folsom Prison]]. Siegel's location work and his use of actual prisoners as extras in the film made a lasting impression on Peckinpah. He worked as a dialogue coach on four additional Siegel films: ''[[Private Hell 36]]'' (1954), ''[[An Annapolis Story]],'' (1955), ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956) and ''[[Crime in the Streets]]'' (1956).<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Weddle|authorlink= David Weddle| title=If They Move...Kill 'Em!| publisher=Grove Press |year = 1994|pages=116–119 | isbn= 0-8021-3776-8}}</ref> 25 years later, Peckinpah was all but banished from the industry due to his troubled film productions. Siegel gave the director a chance to return to filmmaking. He asked Peckinpah if he would be interested in directing 12 days of [[second unit]] work on ''[[Jinxed!]]''. Peckinpah immediately accepted, and his earnest collaboration with his longtime friend was noted within the industry. While Peckinpah's work was uncredited, it would lead to his hiring as the director of his final film ''[[The Osterman Weekend (film)|The Osterman Weekend]]'' (1983).<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Weddle|authorlink= David Weddle| title=If They Move...Kill 'Em!| publisher=Grove Press |year = 1994|pages=534–535 | isbn= 0-8021-3776-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=''Jinxed!'' |work=imdb.com |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084173/trivia |accessdate=March 6, 2012}}</ref>

==Cameos==
He has a [[cameo role]] as a bartender in Eastwood's ''[[Play Misty For Me]]'', and in [[Philip Kaufman]]'s 1978 ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''—a remake of Siegel's own 1956 film—he appears as a "pod" taxi driver. In ''[[Charley Varrick]]'' (a film slated for Eastwood but ultimately turned down by the actor), starring [[Walter Matthau]], he has a cameo as a ping-pong player.

==Personal life==
From 1948 to 1953 he was married to actress [[Viveca Lindfors]], with whom he had a son, [[Kristoffer Tabori]]. He married [[Doe Avedon]] (a former actress and ex-wife of photographer [[Richard Avedon]]) in 1957.  They adopted four children and later divorced.  He married Carol Rydall, former assistant to Clint Eastwood, and they remained together until he died at the age of 78 from cancer in [[Nipomo]], California.  He is buried near Highway 1 in the coastal Cayucos-Morro Bay District Cemetery.
