== Early life ==

Tony Jaa was born in Surin province, Isaan, Thailand, and was raised in a rural area in Surin.<ref name="aboutfilm">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutfilm.com/features/jaa/interview.htm|title=Profile & Interview: Tony Jaa|last=Cavagna|first=Carlo|publisher=AboutFilm|accessdate=2011-09-12}}</ref> His hometown is 400&nbsp;km from [[Bangkok]]. As he grew up he watched films by [[Bruce Lee]], [[Jackie Chan]], Vince Lam and [[Jet Li]] at temple fairs, which was his inspiration to learn martial arts. He was so inspired by them that while he was doing chores or playing with friends, he would imitate the martial arts moves that he had seen, practicing in his father's [[paddy field|rice paddy]]. When he was 10 years old, he threatened his father that he would kill himself if he was not taught by [[Panna Rittikrai]].<ref name="about" />

"What they [Chan, Lee and Li] did was so beautiful, so heroic that I wanted to do it too," Jaa told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in a 2004 interview. "I practiced until I could do the move exactly as I had seen the masters do it."<ref>Perrin, Andrew (October 18, 2004). [http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501041025-725168,00.html "Hitting the big time"], ''Time''.</ref><ref>Perrin, Andrew (October 18, 2004). [http://content.time.com/time/quotes/0,26174,725168,00.html "Quotes of the Day"]</ref>

He began training in muay thai at the local temple from age 8 and at age 15 he requested to become a protégé of stuntman and action-film director [[Panna Rittikrai]].<ref name="about" /> Panna had instructed Jaa to attend Maha Sarakham College of Physical Education in [[Maha Sarakham Province]]. He has trained for an unspecified time in [[taekwondo]],<ref name="about" /><ref name="aboutfilm"/> earning a black belt in the art, although there are no details regarding if this was in formal [[taekwondo]] training or as part of his stunt team member apprenticeship. Likewise, he is highly skilled in [[muay Thai]] and has fought competitively many times during Muay Thai Training Camp, without losing. 

Jaa won several gold medals in Thailand for track running, fencing and gymnastics. He is a well versed martial artist excelling in [[Muay Boran]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Aikido]], [[Judo]], [[Wushu (sport)|Wushu]], and [[Taekwondo]]. Jaa was also self-trained in various [[kung fu]] styles as well as [[krabi krabong]], [[lethwei]] and [[kino mutai]], which he can be seen using in the Ong Bak and Tum Yum Goong films. He was a successful high jump athlete in university.<ref name="about" /><ref name="aboutfilm"/> He is still able to jump two meters high.<ref name="aboutfilm"/>

Although born in Thailand, Jaa is actually of [[Cambodian]] descent, more known as "[[Khmer Surin]]". He can speak both Thai and [[Khmer]].

== Career ==

=== Stunt work ===
Tony Jaa's most notable stunt work was being the stunt man for the character of Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat Annihilation. Tony initially worked as a [[stunt double|stuntman]] for 14 years, [[Muay Thai Stunt]], appearing in many of Panna's films. He doubled for [[Sammo Hung]] when the martial-arts actor made a commercial for an energy drink that required him to grasp an elephant's tusks and somersault onto the elephant's back.<ref>Pornpitagpan, Nilubol (February 3, 2003). [http://www.bangkokpost.net/education/site2003/ftfb1103.htm "Leap into the limelight"]. ''[[Bangkok Post]]''.</ref> He was also a stunt double in the Thai television series ''Insee Daeng'' (''Red Eagle'').<ref>Yusof, Zack (November 21, 2003). [http://web.archive.org/web/20031204183807/http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2003/11/21/movies/6741584&sec=movies "Selling a Thai style"], ''[[The Star (Malaysia)]]'' (retrieved from Archive.org on December 15, 2006).</ref>

=== Acting ===
Together, Panna and Jaa developed an interest in [[muay boran]], the predecessor of [[muay Thai]] and worked and trained for four years at the art with the intention of developing a film about it. Eventually they were able to put together a short film showing what Jaa could do with the help of instructor Grandmaster Mark Harris. One of the people they showed it to was producer-director [[Prachya Pinkaew]], who was duly impressed.

This led to ''[[Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior]]'' in [[2003 in film|2003]], Jaa's break-out role as a leading man. Jaa did all the stunts without mechanical assistance or computer-generated effects and it showcased his style of extreme acrobatics and speedy, dance-like moves. Injuries suffered in the filming included a ligament injury and a sprained ankle. One scene in the film involved fighting with another actor while his own trousers were on fire. "I actually got burned," he said in a 2005 interview. "I really had to concentrate because once my pants were on fire the flames spread upwards very fast and burnt my eyebrows, my eyelashes and my nose. Then we had to do a couple more takes to get it right.".<ref>Franklin, Erika. May 2005. [http://www.firecracker-media.com/issue06/interview0601.shtml#top "Alive and Kicking: Tony Jaa interviewed"], ''Firecracker Media'' (retrieved on December 15, 2006)</ref>

His second major movie was ''[[Tom-Yum-Goong]]'' (''The Protector'' in the US), named after a type of Thai soup and including a style of muay Thai that imitates elephants.

In August 2006, he was in New York to promote the US release of ''[[Tom-Yum-Goong|The Protector]]'', including an appearance at the [[American Museum of the Moving Image|Museum of the Moving Image]].<ref>Hendrix, Grady.

=== Next projects ===
[[Sahamongkol Film International]] advertised that Tony Jaa's third film would be called ''Sword'' or ''Daab Atamas'', about the art of Thai two-sword fighting (''[[krabi krabong|daab song mue]]''), with a script by Prapas Chonsalanont.<ref>Kaiju Shakedown, [http://www.kaijushakedown.com/2005/05/next_tony_jaa_p.html "Next Tony Jaa project announced"], May 27, 2005.</ref> But due to a falling out between Prachya and Jaa, which neither have publicly commented on, ''Sword'' has been cancelled.<ref name = "hit"/>

On March 2006 it was reported that there would be a sequel to ''[[Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior|Ong-Bak]]'', ''[[Ong Bak 2|Ong-Bak 2]]''. With Jaa both directing and starring, it started pre-production in fall 2006 and was released in December 2008.<ref name = "hit">Payee, Parinyaporn, [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/11/15/lifestyle/lifestyle_30056086.php A hit of 'Chocolate'], The Nation (Thailand); retrieved 2007-11-18</ref><ref>Payee, Parinyaporn.

While Jaa and Amogelang were working on ''Ong-Bak 2'', director [[Prachya Pinkaew]] and action ya choreographer [[Panna Rittikrai]] were working on ''[[Chocolate (2008 film)|Chocolate]]'', starring a female martial artist, [[Nicharee Vismistananda]], and released February 6, 2008.<ref name = "hit"/>  Jaa had been cast in a small role in a third installment of the ''[[King Naresuan (film)|King Naresuan]]'' film series directed by [[Chatrichalerm Yukol]], although the film was ultimately cancelled. ''Ong Bak 3'' was released in 2010 and provides a conclusion to this Thai trilogy.

=== Other developments ===
His films captured the attention of his hero, [[Jackie Chan]], who asked director [[Brett Ratner]] to cast Jaa in ''[[Rush Hour 3]]''. "I gave the director videos of Tony Jaa because I think Tony Jaa is the most well-rounded of all action stars," Chan told the Associated Press.<ref name=IHT>{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/09/20/arts/AS_A-E_MOV_Jackie_Chan_Tony_Jaa.php# |title= Jackie Chan says he plugged Thai Tony Jaa for 'Rush Hour 3,' but he didn't sign on|accessdate=2007-08-13 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=International Herald Tribune}}</ref> "The director liked him a lot," Chan said.<ref name=IHT/> However, Jaa said he'd be unable to participate because of scheduling conflicts with the shooting of ''Ong Bak 2''.<ref name=IHT/><ref name=Kaiju>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaijushakedown.com/2006/05/brett_ratners_a.html  |title= Brett Ratner's Asian orgy | accessdate=2007-08-13 |author=Grady Hendrix |publisher=Kaiju Shakedown via Internet Archive |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070118074844/http://www.kaijushakedown.com/2006/05/brett_ratners_a.html |archivedate = 2007-01-18}}</ref>

Tony Jaa also released ''[[Ong Bak 3]]'', as a sequel to the prequel ''Ong Bak 2''.

=== Monasticism ===
On May 28, 2010, Jaa became a [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] at a Buddhist temple in [[Surin, Thailand]].

=== Return to acting ===
After leaving the monastery, it came as a surprise to all that Jaa accepted a deal with [[Sahamongkol Film International Co. Ltd.|Sahamongkol film company]]. He filmed ''[[Tom Yum Goong 2]]'' for them, with ''[[Chocolate (2008 film)|Chocolate]]'' star [[Yanin Vismitananda|Jija Yanin]] in a major role too, the first time Jaa has shared the big screen with another international martial arts star. Director [[Prachya Pinkaew]] and choreographer [[Panna Rittikrai]] also returned for this film.<ref>[http://twitchfilm.com/news/2011/04/tony-jaa-and-prachya-pinkaew-reunite-for-tom-yum-goong-2.php News: Tony Jaa And Prachya Pinkaew Reunite For TOM YUM GOONG 2].

Jaa co-starred in the blockbuster action film ''[[Furious 7]]'' (2015).
