'''Andrew Vabre "Andy" Devine''' (October 7, 1905 &ndash; February 18, 1977<ref>''Andy Devine, Western Character, Dead at 71'', Fairbanks Daily News Miner, February 19, 1977, page A6</ref>) was an American [[character actor]] and comic cowboy [[sidekick]] known for his distinctive, whiny voice.

==Early life==
Born in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], on October 7, 1905, Andy Devine grew up in [[Kingman, Arizona|Kingman]], where his family moved when he was a year old. His father was Thomas Devine Jr., born in 1869 in [[Kalamazoo County, Michigan]]. Andy's grandfather, Thomas Devine Sr., was born in 1842 in County Tipperary, Ireland, and emigrated to the United States in 1852. Andy's mother was Amy Ward, the granddaughter of Commander [[James H. Ward]], the first officer of the United States Navy killed during the Civil War.

He attended St. Mary and St. Benedict's College, Northern Arizona State Teacher's College (now [[Northern Arizona University]]), and was a star [[American football|football]] player at [[Santa Clara University]].<ref>Corneau, Ernest N.

His football experience led to his first sizable film role, in the 1931 ''The Spirit of Notre Dame''.<ref name=Culver/>

==Career==
[[File:Andy Devine 1958.JPG|thumb|left|With [[Rosemary Clooney]] in 1958]]
He had acting ambitions, so, after college, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a [[Venice Beach]] lifeguard,<ref name=Culver/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobnolan-sop.net/Reference/Magazine.htm#1946_April_Screen_Stars_ |title=Prairie Tales |author=Frances Lane |publisher=''[[Screen Stars]]'' magazine, April 1946 issue, p. 72 |accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref> within easy distance of the studios. Andy met his wife-to-be, Dorothy House,  in 1933 while filming  ''Doctor Bull'' at Fox Studios. They were married on October 28, 1933, in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and remained united until his death on February 18, 1977. They had five children: Andrew Devine, Jr. (born 1934), Patrick Gabriel Devine (born 1935), Susanna Rachel Devine (born 1937), Arthur Matthew Devine (born 1938) and Deborah Catherine Devine (born 1941). Andy, Jr. and Patrick are both actors, while their other children have pursued other careers.

Although it was first thought that his peculiar, wheezy voice would prevent him from moving to the talkies, instead it became his trademark. Devine claimed that his speech resulted from a childhood accident. He had been running with a curtain rod in his mouth at the Beale Hotel in Kingman, and, when he fell, it pierced the roof of his mouth. When he was able to speak again, he had developed a labored, scratchy, duo-tone voice. A biographer, however, indicated that this was one of several stories Devine fabricated about his voice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.froggythegremlin.com/ |title=Froggy The Gremlin |publisher=Froggy The Gremlin |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110207175700/http://froggythegremlin.com/| archivedate= 7 February 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Devine's son Tad related in an Encore Westerns Channel interview (Jim Beaver, reporting from the 2007 Newport Beach Film Festival) that there indeed had been an accident, but that he was uncertain if it resulted in his unique voice. When asked if he had strange nodes on his vocal cords, Devine replied, "I've got the same nodes as [[Bing Crosby]], but his are in tune."

He appeared in more than 400 films and shared with [[Walter Brennan]], another character actor, the rare ability to move with ease from "[[B-movie|B]]" [[Western movie|Western]]s to "A" pictures.  His notable roles included ten films as sidekick "Cookie" to [[Roy Rogers]], a role in ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1936), and "Danny" in ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1937). He made several appearances in films with [[John Wayne]], including ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939), ''[[Island in the Sky (1953 film)|Island in the Sky]]'' (1953), and as the frightened marshal in ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962).  He was a long-time contract player with Universal, who in 1939 paired him with [[Richard Arlen]] for a series of fast-paced B-pictures (usually loaded with stock footage) that mixed action and comedy; they made 14 over a two-year period. When Arlen left in 1941, the series continued for another two years teaming Devine with various actors, often [[Leo Carrillo]]. While most of his characters were reluctant to get involved in the action, he played the hero in ''[[Island in the Sky (1953 film)|Island in the Sky]],'' as an expert pilot who leads his fellow aviators through the arduous search for a missing airplane.  Although Devine was known generally for his comic roles, [[Jack Webb]] cast him as a police detective in ''[[Pete Kelly's Blues (film)|Pete Kelly's Blues]]'' (1955); Devine lowered his voice and was more serious than usual. His film appearances in his later years included movies such as ''[[Zebra in the Kitchen]]'', ''[[The Over-the-Hill Gang]]'', and "Coyote Bill" in ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]''.

Devine also worked in radio. He is well-remembered for his role as "Jingles", [[Guy Madison|Guy Madison's]] sidekick in ''[[The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok]]'', which Devine and Madison reprised on television.  He appeared over 75 times on [[Jack Benny]]'s radio show between 1936 and 1942, often appearing in Benny's semi-regular western series of sketches "Buck Benny Rides Again".  Benny frequently referred to Devine as "the mayor of [[Van Nuys]]."  In fact Devine served as honorary mayor of that city, where he lived, preferring to be away from the bustle of Hollywood, from May 18, 1938 to 1957, when he moved to [[Newport Beach]].<ref>''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', May 10, 1938, Andy Devine Named 'Mayor'</ref><ref>[http://www.classicimages.com/articles/2010/10/18/past_articles/devineandy.txt ]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>

Devine worked in television.  He hosted a children's TV show, ''[[Andy's Gang]]'' on [[NBC]] from 1955 to 1960. During this time, he also made multiple appearances on NBC's ''[[The Ford Show|The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford]]''. He played "Hap" on the TV series ''[[Flipper (1964 TV series)|Flipper]]'', also on [[NBC]], in the 1960s. He starred in a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode called "[[Hocus-Pocus and Frisby (The Twilight Zone)|Hocus-Pocus and Frisby]]" as "Frisby", a teller of tall tales who impressed a group of gullible alien kidnappers. He was also a frequent guest star on many television shows throughout the 1950s and 1960s, including the role of Jake Sloan in the 1961 episode "Big Jake" of the acclaimed NBC [[anthology series]] ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]''. He also played Honest John Denton in the episode "A Horse of a Different Cutter" of the short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[The Rounders (TV series)|The Rounders]]''.

Devine also cameoed as Santa Claus during one of Batman and Robin's famous Batrope climbs on the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|live-action ''Batman'' TV series]].  The episode, entitled "The Duo Is Slumming", was originally broadcast on December 22, 1966, just three days before Christmas.  During the appearance he directly addresses the viewers wishing them a Merry Christmas.

Finally, Devine performed voice parts in [[animated film]]s, including "[[Friar Tuck]]" in [[Walt Disney|Disney's]] ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]''. He provided the voice of Cornelius the Rooster in several [[Kellogg's Corn Flakes]] TV commercials.

In 1973, Devine came to [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], [[Louisiana]], at the request of [[George C. Brian]], an actor and filmmaker who headed the theater department at the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]], to perform in [[Edna Ferber]]'s ''[[Show Boat]]''.

==In popular culture==
Andy Devine is nostalgically remembered alongside other 20th century celebrities in [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s song "[[Pencil Thin Mustache]]."
[[Frank Zappa]]'s song [[One Size Fits All (Frank Zappa album)|Andy]] contains Andy Devine in the lyrics. Zappa's concept album [[Thing-Fish]] includes a character named Ann D. Devine.

==Death==
Devine died of [[leukemia]] at the age of 71 in [[Orange, California]] in 1977. His funeral mass was held at Holy Family Cathedral. The main street of his home town of Kingman was renamed "Andy Devine Avenue" in his honor.  His career is highlighted in the Mohave Museum of History and Arts in Kingman, and there is a star in his honor on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].
