'''Bob Steele''' (January 23, 1907 – December 21, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] actor.

==Biography==
He was born Robert Adrian Bradbury in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]], into a [[vaudeville]] family. His parents were [[Robert N. Bradbury|Robert North Bradbury]] (1886–1949) and the former Nieta Catherine Quinn (1886–1978).<ref name=fgrave>{{FAG|5440|Bob Steele}}</ref> After years of touring, the family settled in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], [[California]], in the late 1910s, where his father soon found work in the movies, first as an actor, later as a director. By 1920, Robert Bradbury hired Bob and his twin brother, Bill (1907–1971), as juvenile leads for a series of adventure movies titled ''[[The Adventures of Bob and Bill]]''.

Steele's career began to take off for good in 1927, when he was hired by production company [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO) to star in a series of [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]. Renamed Bob Steele at FBO, he soon made a name for himself, and in the late 1920s, 1930s and 1940s starred in [[B movie|B-Westerns]] for almost every minor film studio, including [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram]], [[A. W. Hackel|Supreme]], [[Tiffany (movie studio)|Tiffany]], Syndicate, [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] (including several films of the ''[[Three Mesquiteers]]'' series) and [[Producers Releasing Corporation]] (PRC) (including the initial films of their "[[Billy the Kid]]" series), plus he had the occasional role in an A-movie, as in the adaptation of [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel, ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 movie)|Of Mice and Men]]'' in 1939.

==Career==
{{Further|Bob Steele filmography}}
In the 1940s, Steele's career as a [[cowboy]] hero was on the decline, but he kept himself working by accepting supporting roles in big movies like [[Howard Hawks]]' ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'', or the [[John Wayne]] vehicles ''[[Island in the Sky (1953 film)|Island in the Sky]]'', ''[[Rio Bravo (1959 film)|Rio Bravo]]'' and ''[[Rio Lobo]]''. Besides these he also made occasional appearances in science fiction films like ''[[Atomic Submarine]]'' and ''[[Giant from the Unknown]]''.

Steele also performed on television, including the role of Sergeant Granger in the premiere episode, "The Peacemaker", in 1957 of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/Colt45.htm|title=Colt .45|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=December 22, 2012}}</ref> In 1957, he was cast as Sam Shoulders in "Bunch Quitter" in another ABC/WB western series, ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', with [[Will Hutchins]]. He appeared in 1958 and 1959 in two episodes of the [[NBC]] western, ''[[The Californians (TV series)|The Californians]]''.

Steele appeared as "Kirby" with [[Agnes Moorehead]] and [[Madlyn Rhue]] in the 1959 episode "In Memoriam" of another ABC western series, ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'', starring [[Nick Adams (actor)|Nick Adams]]. He also appeared as Deputy Sam in four episodes of [[Hugh O'Brian]]'s ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]''. In 1959, he appeared with [[Mason Alan Dinehart]], another ''Wyatt Earp'' alumnus, in the episode "Half a Loaf" of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] series, ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Stanley Andrews]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556629/|title="Half a Loaf" (April 25, 1959)|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}</ref>

In the middle 1960s, Steele was cast in a regular supporting role as Trooper Duffy in ABC's ''[[F Troop]]'', which allowed him to show his comic talent. Trooper Duffy in the ''F Troop'' story line claimed to have been "shoulder to shoulder with [[Davy Crockett]] at the [[battle of the Alamo|Alamo]]" and to have been the only survivor of the battle forty years before. In real life, forty years before F Troop Steele played a supporting role in his father's 1926 film ''[[Davy Crockett at the Fall of the Alamo]]''!
