'''Harry Carey''' (January 16, 1878 – September 21, 1947) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and one of [[silent film]]'s earliest superstars. He was the father of [[Harry Carey Jr.]], who was also a prominent actor.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Human stuff.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Human Stuff'' (1920).]]
Carey was born '''Henry DeWitt Carey II''' in [[the Bronx, New York]], a son of Henry DeWitt Carey,<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/hcary.htm rootsweb]</ref> a prominent lawyer and judge of the [[New York Supreme Court]], and his wife Ella J. (Ludlum). He grew up on [[City Island, Bronx]].<ref>Berger, Meyer. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B15F9345810738DDDAE0894DD405B8088F1D3 "ABOUT NEW YORK"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 7, 1940. Accessed October 15, 2009. "Harry Carey's description of City Island when he was a boy in the Eighties made a hoarse and mildly profane pastorale."</ref>

Carey was a cowboy, railway superintendent, author, lawyer and playwright. He attended Hamilton Military Academy, then studied law at [[New York University]]. When a boating accident led to pneumonia, he wrote a play while recuperating and toured the country performing in it for three years. His play was very successful, but Carey lost it all when his next play was a failure. In 1911, his friend [[Henry B. Walthall]] introduced him to director [[D.W. Griffith]], with whom Carey would make many films.

Carey is best remembered as one of the first stars of the [[Western film]] genre. One of his most popular roles was as the good-hearted outlaw Cheyenne Harry. The Cheyenne Harry franchise spanned two decades, from ''[[A Knight of the Range]]'' (1916) to ''Aces Wild'' (1936).<ref>Gallagher, Tag (1986); ''John Ford: The Man and His Films''; University of California Press, USA. See pp.502ff.</ref> Carey starred in director [[John Ford]]'s first feature film, ''[[Straight Shooting]]'' (1918).

Carey's rugged frame and craggy features were well suited to westerns and outdoor adventures. When sound films arrived, Carey displayed an assured, gritty baritone voice that suited his rough-hewn screen personality. He was the logical choice for the title role in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s outdoor jungle epic ''[[Trader Horn (1931 film)|Trader Horn]]''. By this time Carey, already in his fifties, was too mature for most leading roles, and the only starring roles that he was offered were in low-budget westerns and [[serial (film)|serials]]. He soon settled into a comfortable career as a solid, memorable character actor; he received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his role as the President of the Senate in the 1939 film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]''. Among his other notable later roles were that of M/Sgt. Robert White, crew chief of the bomber "Mary Ann" in the 1943 [[Howard Hawks]] film ''[[Air Force (film)|Air Force]]'' and Mr. Melville, the cattle buyer, in Hawks's ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]''. Carey made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage debut in 1940, in ''Heavenly Express'' with [[John Garfield]].

==Personal life==
He married at least twice and perhaps a third time (census records for 1910 indicate he had a wife named Clare E. Carey, and some references state that he was also married to actress Fern Foster). His last marriage was to actress [[Olive Fuller Golden]] in 1920; they were together until his death. They purchased a large ranch in [[Saugus, California]], north of [[Los Angeles]], which, in 2005, was turned into Tesoro Adobe Historic Park.<ref>Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation: [http://www.lacountyparks.org/Parkinfo.asp?URL=cms1_047117.asp&Title=Tesoro%20Adobe%20Park Tesoro Adobe Historic Park]. For more photographs, see [http://www.placesearth.com/usa/california/los_angeles/tesoro_adobe/tesoro_adobe.shtml "Places, Earth: Tesoro Adobe Historic Park"].</ref>

Their son, [[Harry Carey, Jr.]], would become a character actor, most famous for his roles in westerns. Father and son both appear (albeit in different scenes) in the 1948 film, ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', and mother and son are both featured in 1956's ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]''.

==Death==
Harry Carey died in 1947 from a combination of [[lung cancer]], [[emphysema]] and [[coronary thrombosis]], at the age of 69. He was interred in [[Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in the family mausoleum in the Bronx, New York.

==Honors and homages==
For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Harry Carey has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1521 Vine Street.

In the 1948 John Ford film, ''[[3 Godfathers]]'', Carey is remembered at the beginning of the film and dubbed "Bright Star of the early western sky..." 

As an homage to him, [[John Wayne]] held his right elbow with his left hand in the closing shot of ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', imitating a stance Carey himself often used in his films.  According to Wayne, both he and Carey's widow Olive (who costarred in the film) wept when the scene was finished.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_(documentary)#Episode_list John Wayne describes this in Episode 9 ('Out West') of Kevin Brownlow's documentary series 'Hollywood' (1980)</ref>

In 1976, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].

In 1987, his name was emblazoned along the Walk of the Western Stars on Main Street in Old Town Newhall in Santa Clarita, California. (His son, Harry Carey Jr. was also honored in 2005).
