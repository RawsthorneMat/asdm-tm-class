'''Belle Bennett''' (April 22, 1891 â€“ November 4, 1932) was a [[Theatre|stage]] and [[Film|screen]] actress who started her professional career in [[vaudeville]]. She was born in [[Milaca, Minnesota|Milaca]], [[Minnesota]].

==Stage actress==
Bennett appeared in [[circus]] performances during her childhood. Her father was Billie Bennett, owner of a circus. He trained her to be a [[trapeze]] performer after she spent some years in the Sacred Heart Convent in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. By age thirteen she was appearing in public. Performances with stock companies led Bennett to [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. There she appeared in theatrical productions staged by [[David Belasco]].

==Motion pictures==
Bennett was working as a film actress by 1913, and was cast in numerous one-reel shorts by small east coast film companies. She appeared in minor motion pictures like the western film ''[[A Ticket to Red Horse Gulch]]'' (Mutual 1914). She starred in several full-length films by the Triangle Film Corporation, including The Lonely Woman (1918). She also appeared on the east coast United States Moving Picture Corporation's  film ''Flesh and Spirit'' (1922). 

She made the move to Hollywood before [[Samuel Goldwyn]] selected her from among seventy-three actresses for the leading role in ''[[Stella Dallas (1925 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' (1925). The film has been ranked as one of the finest movies of all time. While filming the movie her son, sixteen-year-old William Howard Macy, died. Macy had posed as Bennett's brother for some time because of her fear that her employers might find out her true age. She was actually thirty-four rather than twenty-four, which she had claimed to be.

After playing the ''mother'' role in ''Stella Dallas'' Bennett was typecast for the remainder of her film career. She later appeared in ''[[Mother Machree]]'' (1928), ''[[The Battle of the Sexes (1928 film)|The Battle of the Sexes]]'' (1928), ''[[The Iron Mask (1929 film)|The Iron Mask]]'' (1929), ''[[Courage (1930 film)|Courage]]'' (1930), ''[[Recaptured Love]]'' (1930) and ''The Big Shot'' (1931).

==Marriages==
Bennett was married three times. Jack Oaker, a sailor at the [[San Pedro, California]] submarine base, was married to her when she worked with the [[Triangle Film Corporation]], in 1918. Her second husband was William Macy of [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]. She later married film director Fred Windermere.

==Illness and death==
During a break in her film career Bennett performed in vaudeville at a [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] theater. She collapsed on stage and was eventually checked into a [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] hospital. There she underwent [[blood transfusion]]s and was able to continue acting briefly. In September 1932 she was rushed by plane from [[New York]] following a relapse of [[cancer]] which she had been suffering from for two and a half years. She died that November at the age of 41 at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center|Cedars of Lebanon Hospital]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Late in her life Bennett came to believe in the power of prayer. A practitioner of [[Christian Science]] influenced her. She is interred in the [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[North Hollywood]].

Bennett has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. <!-- where? -->
