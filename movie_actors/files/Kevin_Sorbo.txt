To help make tuition, he began to work as a [[Model (person)|model]] for print and television advertising in the 1980s.

==Career==
 {{Refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Sorbo started his acting career in 1986 making guest appearances in several television series such as ''[[1st & Ten (HBO TV series)|1st & Ten]]'', ''[[Murder She Wrote]]'' and ''[[The Commish]]''<!-- He was considered for and lost out to [[Dean Cain]] as [[Superman]] in ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' and was a possible contender for the role of [[Agent Mulder]] in ''[[The X Files]]'' which went to [[David Duchovny]]-->.

In 1994, he shot to fame when he played the role of [[Hercules]] in the [[television film]] ''[[Hercules and the Amazon Women]]''. This was the first in a series of television films that served as [[television pilot|pilots]] for the TV series ''[[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]'', which ran from 1995 to 1999. He also directed a few episodes of the series. At the same time, Sorbo also guest-starred as Hercules in episodes of the 1995–2001 spin-off series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' and provided the voice of Hercules in the 1998 [[direct-to-video]] [[animated]] film ''[[Hercules and Xena - The Animated Movie: The Battle for Mount Olympus]]''.

Other voice-over work followed, with Sorbo providing the voices of [[Reiko (Mortal Kombat)|Reiko]] and [[Quan Chi]] in the 1997 video game ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]''. In between the years playing ''Hercules'', he played his first leading film role in ''[[Kull the Conqueror]]'' (1997).

After ''Hercules'' came to an end, Sorbo played the starring role of Captain [[Dylan Hunt (Andromeda)|Dylan Hunt]] in the science-fiction drama series ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' from 2000 to 2005. In 2006, he played a recurring role on the final season of ''[[The O.C.]]'' and guest-starred in the sitcom ''[[Two and a Half Men]]''. In 2007, he starred in the [[direct-to-video]] film ''[[Walking Tall: The Payback]]'', which was a sequel to the 2004 film ''[[Walking Tall (2004 film)|Walking Tall]]''. He reprised his role in the second sequel, ''[[Walking Tall: Lone Justice]]'' which released later that year. He also starred in the Lifetime Channel film ''Last Chance Café'', the [[Hallmark Channel]] film ''[[Avenging Angel (2007 TV film)|Avenging Angel]]'', co-starring his real life wife [[Sam Jenkins]] and guest starred as a bounty hunter in the season-two episode "Bounty Hunters!" of the series ''[[Psych]]''. He appeared in the 2008 [[parody film|spoof film]] ''[[Meet the Spartans]]'', which was a box office success<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/charts/weekly/2008/20080125.php |title=Weekend Box Office Chart for January 25th, 2008 |publisher=The Numbers |date=January 25, 2008 |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref> despite being universally negatively reviewed by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/meet_the_spartans/ |title=Meet the Spartans |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref> He starred in the [[Albert Pyun]] directed science fiction vampire film ''Tales of the Ancient Empire''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Woman |first=The |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36619/pre-order-tales-ancient-empire-new-work-progress-screengrab |title=Pre-Order Tales of an Ancient Empire; Work-in-Progress Screengrab & Behind-the-Scenes Clip &#124; Horror Movie, DVD, & Book Reviews, News, Interviews at Dread Central |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |date=March 26, 2010 |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref>

In an [[Blooper|outtake clip]] from the ''Hercules'' TV series posted in 2010, Sorbo, portraying an evil [[Doppelgänger]] of his regular character, says "Wait a minute. This isn't my world. Disappointed!"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p53iqTPLt_E | title=Hercules - DISAPPOINTED | publisher=youtube.com |date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref> Due to the [[non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]] sound of the line, the scene was widely misinterpreted as Sorbo reading aloud the stage direction "disappointed". In 2013, Sorbo explained in an interview that "disappointed" did not appear in the script, but rather was him breaking character as an in-joke between him and the crew. He was referencing a scene from the film ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' in which Otto (played by [[Kevin Kline]]) cracks a safe only to find it empty, and screams, "Disappointed!" at it in frustration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p53iqTPLt_E | title=Kevin Sorbo "disappointed" Meaning | publisher=youtube.com |date=February 16, 2013 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}</ref>

He served as Executive Producer and star of the movie ''Abel's Field'' in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianactivities.com/abels-field-kevin-sorbo-and-samuel-davis |title=Abel's Field with Kevin Sorbo and Samuel Davis an Inspiring Movie – Christian Activities |publisher=christianactivities.com |date= |accessdate=February 21, 2013}}</ref>
In 2012, Sorbo appeared in an episode of ''Celebrity Ghost Stories'' to recount an experience he had while in Minnesota shortly after he graduated from college. He and his girlfriend claimed to have seen the ghost of the "Bride of White Rock Lake" – a woman who supposedly died on her wedding day, murdered by a former lover.

Sorbo voiced one of the main protagonists, Prometheus, in the [[Wii]] video game ''[[The Conduit]]''.
Sorbo returned to the role of Hercules in a more sinister portrayal, in the video game ''[[God of War III]]'', which was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] in March 2010.

In July 2013, Sorbo, along with his wife, [[Sam Sorbo|Sam]], provided voice over for characters in the video game ''[[Cloudberry Kingdom]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Conditt |first=Jessica |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/10/03/kevin-sorbo-sam-sorbo-martin-olson-star-in-cloudberry-kingdom/ |title=Kevin Sorbo, Sam Sorbo, Martin Olson star in Cloudberry Kingdom |publisher=Joystiq |date=October 3, 2012 |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref>
In 2014 Kevin Sorbo co-starred in ''[[God's Not Dead (film)|God's Not Dead]]'', a film with a very strong underlying pro-Christian narrative. In this film he portrays an atheist who requires his students to disown their religions on the first day of college.

==Personal life==
On January 5, 1998, Sorbo married actress [[Sam Jenkins]], whom he met the previous year when she had a guest role on ''Hercules''. They have three children: Braedon Cooper (born 2001), Shane Haaken (born 2004), and Octavia Flynn (born 2005). Sorbo is the spokesman and chair of A World Fit for Kids! (AWFFK!), a non-profit organization that trains teenagers to become mentors to younger children.

In late 1997 while on a publicity tour for ''Kull the Conqueror'' and between the fourth and fifth seasons of ''Hercules'', the newly engaged Sorbo experienced an [[aneurysm]] in his shoulder which caused three [[stroke]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbn.com/media/player/index.aspx?s=/mp4/MW154v2_WS |title=Hercules Actor Kevin Sorbo's Miracle Healing – CBN TV – Video |publisher=Cbn.com |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref><ref name="HuffPoStroke">{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/19/kevin-sorbo-true-strength-hercules_n_1017368.html | title=Kevin Sorbo's 'True Strength': 'Hercules' Star Says Strokes Were Blessings In Disguise | work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=October 19, 2011 | accessdate=April 14, 2013 | author=Gostin, Nicki}}</ref> As a result, he was weakened for the next several years, a condition kept secret from the public while he recovered. During the last two seasons of ''Hercules'' (the fifth and sixth, which aired in 1998 and 1999), Sorbo had a reduced filming schedule to accommodate his condition, and more guest stars were featured in the show in order to reduce Sorbo's duties.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hammel |first=Sara |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20533357,00.html |title=Hercules Star Kevin Sorbo Reveals He's Had Several Strokes |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}</ref> The strokes, thought to be triggered when chiropractic manipulation of his shoulder released multiple blood clots from the aneurysm, left Sorbo with a permanent 10 percent vision loss, weakness, impaired balance, and migraines.<ref name="ExpressStrokes">{{cite news | url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/304852/Kevin-Sorbo-Three-strokes-left-me-fighting-for-my-life | title=Kevin Sorbo: Three strokes left me fighting for my life | work=[[Daily Express]] | date=February 28, 2012 | accessdate=April 14, 2013 | author=Symons, Jane}}</ref> In his 2011 autobiography ''True Strength'', Sorbo revealed the details of his injury and how his wife Sam helped him recover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/True-Strength-Journey-Hercules-Mortal/dp/B008PH08NO/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1375519514&sr=8-1 |title=True Strength: My Journey from Hercules to Mere Mortal--and How Nearly Dying Saved My Life |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2013}}</ref>

Sorbo is a [[Christian]] and considers himself politically [[Independent (voter)|independent]].<ref name="theblaze">{{cite web | url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/06/hercules-actor-kevin-sorbo-bashes-hollywoods-liberal-hypocrisy-and-rips-obama-one-of-the-worst-records-in-american-history/ | title=Hercules' Actor Kevin Sorbo Bashes Hollywood's Liberal Hypocrisy and Rips Obama: 'One of the Worst Records' in American History | publisher=TheBlaze.com | date=February 6, 2013 | accessdate=4 November 2013 | author=Hallowell, Billy}}</ref> He has expressed interest in the [[libertarian]] philosophy of [[agorism]].<ref name="SilverCircle">{{cite web | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M16vADFIquw | title=Kevin Sorbo talks about ending the printing press and Learning about Agorism | publisher=silverunderground.com | date=December 10, 2012 | accessdate=10 December 2012 | author=Circle, Silver}}</ref>

Sorbo believes Hollywood has limited his career because of his Christian views.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/03/20/kevin-sorbo-why-is-hollywood-so-afraid-god/ |title=Kevin Sorbo: Why is Hollywood so afraid of God? |publisher=Fox News |date=2014-03-20 |accessdate=2014-06-02}}</ref>

In August 2014, Sorbo gave a call-in interview to the Christian-themed Peter Heck Radio Show, during which, the 2014 film ''[[Noah (2014 film)|Noah]]'' and its writer-producer-director [[Darren Aronofsky]] were briefly discussed. Sorbo made the following comment sprinkled with jestful laughter about Hollywood not being serious about Biblical movies, as evidenced by Aronofsky, an admitted atheist,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/24/atheist-noah-director-brags-film-least-biblical-bi/ |title = Atheist 'Noah' director brags film is least biblical Bible movie ever |last = Chumley |first = Cheryl K. |date = March 24, 2014 |website = washingtontimes.com |publisher = ''[[The Washington Times]]'' |accessdate = June 1, 2015}}</ref> being hired to make the Old Testament story of Noah: "I sort of understand why they don't want to deal with the New Testament in Hollywood because, you know, it's, it's pretty much run by the world of the Jewish population, and, at the same time, at least get someone who has, at least believes, that the potential is there, that it could be a real story."<ref>http://www.peterheck.com/peterheck/081014sorbo</ref>
