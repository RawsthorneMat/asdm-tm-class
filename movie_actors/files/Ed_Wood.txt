'''Edward Davis''' "'''Ed'''" '''Wood Jr.'''  (October 10, 1924 — December 10, 1978) was an American screenwriter, director, producer, actor, author and film editor.

In the 1950s, Wood made a number of [[B movie|low-budget]] science fiction, horror and cowboy [[genre fiction|genre]] films, intercutting stock footage. In the 1960s and 1970s, he made [[sexploitation film|sexploitation movies]] and wrote over 80 [[pulp magazine|pulp]] crime, horror and sex novels. In 1980, he was posthumously awarded a [[The Golden Turkey Awards|Golden Turkey Award]] as Worst Director of All Time, renewing public interest in his work.<ref name="Craig 2009 276">{{harv|Craig|2009|p=276}}</ref> Wood's career and [[Camp (style)|camp]] approach has earned him and his films a [[cult following]].

Following the publication of [[Rudolph Grey]]'s 1992 oral biography ''Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr.'', Wood's life and work have undergone a public rehabilitation of sorts, leading up to director [[Tim Burton]]'s biopic of Wood's life, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), a critically acclaimed film starring [[Johnny Depp]] as Wood that earned two [[Academy Award]]s.

==Early years==
Wood's father, Edward Sr., worked for the U.S. [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] as a custodian, and his family relocated numerous times around the United States. Eventually, they settled in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], where Ed Wood, Jr. was born in 1924. According to Wood's second wife, Kathy O'Hara, Wood's mother Lillian would dress him in girl's clothing when he was a child because she had always wanted a daughter.<ref name=grey>{{cite book|last=Grey|first=Rudolph |title=Nightmare Of Ecstasy: The Life and Art Of Edward D. Wood, Jr |year=1994|publisher=Feral House|isbn=0-922-91524-5|page=16}}</ref> For the rest of his life, Wood was a [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] [[Cross-dressing|crossdresser]], infatuated with the feel of angora on his skin.<ref>{{harv|Benshoff|1997|p=157}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Weaver|2004|p=358}}</ref>

During his childhood, Wood was interested in the performing arts and pulp fiction. He collected comics and [[pulp magazine]]s, and adored movies, most notably [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], serials and anything involving the [[occult]]. Buck Jones and Bela Lugosi were two of his earliest childhood idols. He would often skip school in favor of watching pictures at the local movie theater, where [[film still|stills]] from the day's movie would often be thrown in the trash by theater staff, allowing Wood to salvage them to add to his extensive collection.

On his 12th birthday, in 1936, Wood received as a gift his first movie camera, a [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]] "Cine Special". One of his first pieces of footage, and one that imbued him with pride, showed the airship ''[[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]]'' passing over the [[Hudson River]] at Poughkeepsie, shortly before its [[Hindenburg disaster|famous fiery demise]] at [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]]. One of Wood's first paid jobs was as a cinema usher, and he also sang and played drums in a band. He later fronted a singing quartet called "Eddie Wood's Little Splinters", having learned to play a variety of string instruments.

===Military service===
In 1942, Wood enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]], just months after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Assigned to the 6th and 7th Defense Battalions, he reached the rank of Corporal before he was discharged. He was involved in the [[Battle of Tarawa]], among others, and during the war, he lost his two front teeth to a Japanese soldier's rifle butt and was shot several times in the leg by a machine gunner. Wood later claimed that he feared being wounded in battle more than he feared being killed because he wore a bra and panties under his uniform.<ref>{{harv|Hoberman, Rosenbaum|2009|p=265}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Grey|1994|p=20}}</ref>

==Career==

===Directing and screenwriting===
In 1947, Wood moved to Hollywood, California, where he wrote scripts and directed television pilots, commercials and several forgotten micro-budget westerns with names such as ''[[Crossroads of Laredo]]'' and ''Crossroad Avenger: The Legend of the Tucson Kid''. In 1948, Wood wrote, produced, directed, and starred in ''Casual Company'', a play derived from his unpublished novel, which was based on his service in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. It opened at the Village Playhouse to negative reviews on October 25.<ref>{{harv|Grey|1994|pp=23–24}}</ref>

In 1952, Wood was introduced to actor [[Bela Lugosi]] by friend and fellow writer-producer [[Alex Gordon (writer-producer)|Alex Gordon]], Wood's roommate at the time, who went on to help create [[American International Pictures]]. Lugosi's son, [[Bela G. Lugosi|Bela Lugosi, Jr.]], has been among those who felt Wood exploited the senior Lugosi's stardom, taking advantage of the fading actor when he could not refuse any work,<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Thompson, Brett|year=1996 |title=The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr.|medium=Documentary|publisher=Wood-Thomas Pictures}}</ref> while most documents and interviews with other Wood associates in ''Nightmare of Ecstasy'' suggest that Wood and Lugosi were genuine friends and that Wood helped Lugosi through the worst days of his [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[Substance dependence|addiction]]. Lugosi had become dependent on [[morphine]] as a way of controlling his debilitating [[sciatica]] over the years, and was in a horrendous physical state.

===''Glen or Glenda''===
In 1953, Wood wrote and directed the exploitative semi-documentary ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' (originally titled ''I Changed My Sex!'') with producer [[George Weiss (producer)|George Weiss]], which starred Wood (under the alias "Daniel Davis"), his girlfriend [[Dolores Fuller]] and Lugosi as a god-like narrator. The film was loosely based on trans woman [[Christine Jorgensen]]. While panned by critics then and now (being considered as one of Wood's worst films), though many praise the camp qualities, the film is notable for its groundbreaking empathetic portrayal of [[LGBT]] issues at a time when most media were very hostile.

===''Jail Bait''===
In 1954, Wood directed and produced a crime film, ''[[Jail Bait (1954 film)|Jail Bait]]'' (originally titled ''The Hidden Face''), along with co-writer Alex Gordon, which starred [[Lyle Talbot]] and [[Steve Reeves]] (one of his first acting jobs). Bela Lugosi was supposed to play the lead role of the plastic surgeon, but was busy when filming started and had to bow out.

===''Bride of the Monster''===
In 1955, Wood produced and directed the horror film ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'' (originally titled ''Bride of the Atom''), based on an original story idea by Alex Gordon which he entitled ''The Atomic Monster''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autry.com/clubhouse/alex/remembrance.html |title=Alex Gordon |publisher=Autry.com |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}</ref> It starred Bela Lugosi, Swedish wrestler [[Tor Johnson]] and [[Loretta King Hadler|Loretta King]].

Following the making of this film, Lugosi turned himself in to the state hospital for treatment for his drug addiction.

===''Plan 9 from Outer Space''===
In 1956, Wood produced, wrote and directed the science-fiction film ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (originally titled ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space''), which starred Lugosi (in his final film), Tor Johnson, Vampira ([[Maila Nurmi]]), [[Tom Mason]] (who doubled for Lugosi in several scenes) and [[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]] as the narrator. The film was premiered (as "Grave Robbers") at a small screening in 1957, was released theatrically (as "Plan Nine") in 1959, and was sold to [[Late night television in the United States|late night television]] in 1961, thereby finding an audience.

===''The Violent Years''===
In 1956, Wood wrote and produced the exploitation film ''[[The Violent Years]]'' (originally titled ''Teenage Girl Gang'') with director William M. Morgan, starring ''[[Playboy]]'' model [[Jean Moorhead]].

===''Night of the Ghouls''===
In 1958, Wood wrote, produced and directed ''[[Night of the Ghouls]]'' (originally titled ''Revenge of the Dead''), starring Tor Johnson, Criswell, Valda Hansen and Kenne Duncan. The film was only released (marginally) in March 1959, and then promptly vanished from sight for nearly three decades, when it was resurrected on home video. For many years, it was thought to be a lost film. (Wood also wrote the screenplay for the 1958 film ''[[The Bride and the Beast]]'', although someone else directed it.)

===''The Sinister Urge''===
In 1960, Wood wrote and directed the exploitation film ''[[The Sinister Urge (film)|The Sinister Urge]]'' (originally titled ''Racket Queen''), starring Kenne Duncan, Duke Moore and Carl Anthony. Filmed in five days, this is the last mainstream film Wood directed, although it has [[grindhouse]] elements. Ironically, his career would soon spiral downward into a blur of "smut racket" nudie flicks, [[softcore pornography]] and end with [[X rating|X-rated]] novels and films. The scenes of teenagers at a pizza place were shot in 1956 for the unfinished juvenile delinquency film ''Rock and Roll Hell'' (a.k.a. ''Hellborn''). This includes a fight scene performed by Ed Wood himself (uncredited) and Conrad Brooks.

===''Orgy of the Dead''===
In 1963, Wood wrote the screenplay for ''Shotgun Wedding'', an exploitation film about hillbillies marrying child brides, and Wood's transitional film, once again combining two genres, horror and grindhouse skin-flick, was 1965's ''[[Orgy of the Dead]]'', originally titled ''Nudie Ghoulies''. Wood handled various production details while [[Stephen C. Apostolof]] directed under the pseudonym A. C. Stephen. The film begins with a re-creation of the opening scene from the then-unreleased ''Night of the Ghouls''. Criswell, wearing one of Lugosi's old capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost word-for-word from the previous film. Set in a misty graveyard, the Lord of the Dead (Criswell) and his sexy consort, the Black Ghoul (a Vampira look-alike), preside over a series of macabre performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave (recruited by Wood from local strip clubs). The film also features a Wolf Man and a Mummy. Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of sexploitation films up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays and occasionally acted. ''[[Venus Flytrap (film)|Venus Flytrap]]'' (1970), a US/Japan [[horror film]], was based on an unproduced Wood screenplay from the 1950s.<ref>{{harv|Weldon|1996|p=464}}</ref>

===Books and novels===
Beginning in the early 1960s, Wood wrote at least eighty lurid crime and sex novels in addition to hundreds of short stories and non-fiction pieces for magazines. Thirty-two stories known to be by Wood (he sometimes wrote under pseudonyms such as "Ann Gora") are collected in ''Blood Splatters Quickly'' published by [[OR Books]] in 2014. Novels include ''Black Lace Drag'' (1963) (reissued in 1965 as ''Killer in Drag''), ''Orgy of the Dead'' (1965), ''Devil Girls'' (1967), ''Death of a Transvestite'' (1967), ''The Sexecutives'' (1968), ''The Photographer'' (1969), ''[[Take It Out in Trade]]'' (1970), ''The Only House in Town'' (1970),  ''[[Necromania]]'' (1971), ''The Undergraduate'' (1972), ''A Study of Fetishes and Fantasies'' (1973) and ''Fugitive Girls'' (1974).

(In ''Nightmare of Ecstasy'', [[Maila Nurmi]] said she declined Wood's offer to do a nude scene sitting in a coffin for the film version of his ''Necromania'', claiming she was recovering from a major stroke at the time.)<ref>{{harv|Grey|1994|p=135}}</ref>

In 1965, Wood wrote the quasi-[[memoir]] ''[[Hollywood Rat Race]]'', which was eventually published in 1998. In it, Wood advises new writers to "just keep on writing. Even if your story gets worse, you'll get better", and also recounts tales of dubious authenticity, such as how he and Bela Lugosi entered the world of nightclub [[cabaret]].

==Personal life==

===Relationships and marriages===
Wood had a long-term relationship with actress and songwriter [[Dolores Fuller]], whom he met in late 1952. The two lived together for a time and Wood cast Fuller in three of his films: ''Glen or Glenda'', ''Jail Bait'' and ''Bride of the Monster''. Fuller later said she initially had no idea that Wood was a [[crossdresser]] and was mortified when she saw Wood dressed as a woman in ''Glen or Glenda''. The couple broke up in 1955 after Wood cast another actress in the lead role of ''Bride of the Monster'' (Wood originally wrote the part for Fuller) and because of Wood's excessive drinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/11/local/la-me-dolores-fuller-20110511|title=Dolores Fuller dies at 88; actress dated director Ed Wood|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=May 11, 2011|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=June 4, 2013}}</ref>

While making ''Bride of the Monster'' in late 1955, Wood married Norma McCarty. McCarty appeared as Edie, a stewardess in ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2014/film/news/norma-mccarty-dead-1201285478/|title=Norma McCarty, Actress and Wife of Ed Wood, Dies at 93|last=Holman|first=Jordyn|date=August 18, 2014|publisher=variety.com|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}</ref> McCarty had the marriage annulled after six months when she discovered that Wood was a crossdresser.<ref>{{harv|Gerstner|2006|p=620}}</ref>

Wood married his second wife, Kathy O'Hara, in 1959. They remained married until Wood's death in 1978.<ref name="variety">{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946815?refCatId=1236|work=Variety|date=July 16, 2006|title=Kathy Wood |accessdate=September 25, 2011 }}</ref>

===Cross-dressing===
In Wood's 1992 biography ''Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr.'', Wood's wife Kathy recalls that Wood told her that his mother dressed him in girls' clothing as a child.<ref name=grey /> Kathy stated that Wood's transvestism was not a sexual inclination, but rather a neomaternal comfort derived mainly from [[Angora wool|angora]] fabric (angora is featured in many of Wood's films, and "Ann Gora" also happened to be one of Wood's pen names).<ref>{{harv|Grey|1994|p=141}}</ref> Even in his later years, Wood was not shy about going out in public dressed in drag as Shirley, his alter ego—female character (who also appeared in many of his screenplays and stories).<ref>{{harv|Craig|2009|p=108}}</ref>

===Later career===
In 1969, Wood appeared in ''The Photographer'' (a.k.a. ''Love Feast'' or  ''Pretty Models All in a Row''), the first of two films produced by a Marine buddy, Joseph F. Robertson, portraying a photographer using his position to engage in sexual antics with models. He had a smaller role in Robertson's second film, ''Mrs. Stone's Thing'', as a transvestite who spends his time at a party trying on lingerie in a bedroom.

In 1970, Wood made his own pornographic film, ''[[Take It Out in Trade]]'', a softcore take on [[Philip Marlowe]] detective films, and ''[[Necromania]]'' the following year. In the 1970s, Wood worked with friend [[Stephen C. Apostolof]], usually co-writing scripts, but also serving as an assistant director and associate producer. Together they made Wood's ''[[Orgy of the Dead]]'' in 1965. His last known on-screen appearance was in Apostolof's ''Fugitive Girls'' (a.k.a. ''Five Loose Women''), where he played both a gas station attendant called "Pops" and a sheriff on the women's trail.

==Death==
By 1978, Wood's depression had worsened, and with it a serious drinking problem. He and Kathy were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on Thursday December 7, 1978. The couple moved into the North Hollywood apartment of their friend actor Peter Coe. Wood spent the weekend drinking [[vodka]]. Around noon on Sunday December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom. From the bedroom, he asked Kathy to bring him a drink which she refused to do. A few minutes later he yelled out, "Kathy, I can't breathe!" a plea Kathy ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood bossing her around. After hearing no movement from the bedroom for 20 minutes, Kathy sent a friend to check on Wood who discovered him dead from a [[heart attack]]. Kathy later said, "I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. I'll never forget the look in his eyes. He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell."<ref>{{harv|Ford|1999|p=81}}</ref>

Wood was [[Cremation|cremated]], and his ashes were scattered at sea.<ref>{{harv|Grey|1994|p=160}}</ref> Wood's widow Kathy died on June 26, 2006, having not remarried.<ref name="variety"/>

==Legacy and homages==
In 1986, in an essay paying homage to Wood in ''[[Incredibly Strange Films]]'', Jim Morton wrote: "Eccentric and individualistic, Edward D. Wood, Jr. was a man born to film. Lesser men, if forced to make movies under the conditions Wood faced, would have thrown up their hands in defeat."<ref>{{harv|Morton|1986|p=158}}</ref>

In 1994, director Tim Burton released the biopic ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', starring [[Johnny Depp]] in the title role and [[Martin Landau]], who won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. It also won an [[Academy Award for Best Makeup]] for [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]]. The film received mass critical acclaim, but did poorly at the box office. It has since developed a [[cult following]].

In 1996, Reverend Steve Galindo of Seminole, Oklahoma, created a legally recognized religion with Wood as its official savior.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-steve-galindo/ioh-my-godi-god-is-the-pr_b_362417.html | title=Oh My God?: God Is the Producer of Our Lives But We Are the Directors | date=November 18, 2009| publisher=Huffpost Entertainment}}</ref> Originally founded as a joke, the Church of Ed Wood now boasts over 3,500 baptized followers.

In 1997, the [[University of Southern California]] began holding an annual ''Ed Wood Film Festival'', in which student teams are challenged to write, film and edit an Ed Wood-inspired short film based on a preassigned theme. Past themes have included ''Rebel Without a Bra'' (2004), ''What's That in Your Pocket?'' (2005), and ''Slippery When Wet'' (2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web-app.usc.edu/ws/eo2/calendar/32/event/896828 |title=USC Events Calendar |publisher=Web-app.usc.edu |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
In the early 1990s, three of Wood's films (''Bride of the Monster'', ''The Violent Years'', and ''The Sinister Urge'') were featured on the television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', which gave those works wider exposure. Producers of ''MST3K'' considered including ''Plan 9'', but found it had too much dialogue for the show's format.

In 1998, Wood's previously unfilmed script ''[[I Woke Up Early the Day I Died]]'' was finally produced, starring [[Billy Zane]] and [[Christina Ricci]], with appearances by [[Tippi Hedren]], [[Bud Cort]], [[Sandra Bernhard]], [[Karen Black]], [[John Ritter]] and many others. Outside of a brief New York theatrical engagement, the film did not receive a commercial release in the United States, and was only available on video in Germany due to contractual difficulties.

In 2001, horror film director and heavy metal musician [[Rob Zombie]] released ''[[The Sinister Urge (album)|The Sinister Urge]]'', which is named after [[The Sinister Urge (film)|Wood's film]].

In 2002, American horror-punk supergroup [[Murderdolls]] released the album ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls]]'', which features the single "Dead in Hollywood" which makes a reference to Wood with the lyrics, "You can knock on Ed Wood, but it won't do you no good/Cause all of my heroes are dead in Hollywood."

In 2005, the ''Plan 9'' cast were lampooned in an episode of the television series, ''[[Deadly Cinema]]''; the following year, clips of this episode were featured in the documentary, ''Vampira: The Movie''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vampirathemovie.com/cast.php |title=Cast of Vampira: The Movie |publisher=Vampirathemovie.com |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}</ref>

In 2006, ''MST3K'' head writer and host [[Michael J. Nelson]] recorded an audio commentary track for a DVD release of a [[Film colorization|colorized]] version of ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/19598/plan-9-from-outer-space-in-color-with-mike-nelson-commentary/ |title=Plan 9 from Outer Space: In Color (with Mike Nelson Commentary) : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}</ref> In 2009, Nelson and fellow ''MST3K'' alums [[Kevin Murphy (actor)|Kevin Murphy]] and [[Bill Corbett]] mocked ''Plan 9'' again in their very first ''RiffTrax Live'' event, coinciding with the film's 50th anniversary.

In 2012, director John Johnson announced plans to film a remake of ''Plan 9 From Outer Space'', released straight-to-DVD in 2015.

===Documentaries===
* ''Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion'', was released in 1992. This exhaustive two-hour documentary by Mark Carducci chronicles the making of ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' and features interviews with Maila Nurmi (Vampira), Paul Marco, Conrad Brooks, et al. In 2000, Image Entertainment included the documentary on the DVD reissue of ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' (in a two-disc set with ''[[Robot Monster]]'').

* ''Ed Wood: Look Back in Angora'', released in 1994 by [[Rhino Home Video]], is a one-hour documentary on Wood's life and films. This includes rare outtakes and interviews with Dolores Fuller, Kathy Wood, Stephen Apostolof, and Conrad Brooks.  [[Gary Owens]] narrates; [[Ted Newsom]] wrote and directed.

* ''The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood Jr.'', written and directed by Brett Thompson, came out in 1995. This documentary about the life and films of Ed Wood features interviews with Wood's friends and co-workers and closely resembles Wood's own style, albeit with slightly better miniatures.

* ''The Incredibly Strange Film Show'' presented by ''Jonathan Ross''.

==Lost films==
Wood's 1972 film ''The Undergraduate'' is considered to be a [[lost film]], as was his 1970 film ''Take It Out in Trade''. An 80-minute print of ''Take It Out In Trade'' was later discovered and publicly exhibited at Anthology Film Archives in New York City in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&month=09&year=2014#showing-43174|title=Film Screenings/Film Calendar (September 2014)|publisher=anthologyfilmarchives.org}}</ref><ref name="piepenburg">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/movies/ed-wood-b-movie-king-gets-a-film-retrospective.html?_r=0|title=Wild Rides to Inner Space|last=Piepenburg|first=Erik|date=August 28, 2014|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}</ref> Silent [[outtake]]s from the film were released by [[Something Weird Video]].<ref name="Craig 2009 276"/>

Wood's 1971 film ''[[Necromania]]'' was also believed lost for years until an edited version resurfaced at a [[Garage sale|yard sale]] in 1992, followed by a complete unedited print in 2001. A complete print of the previously lost Wood pornographic film ''[[The Young Marrieds (film)|The Young Marrieds]]'' was discovered in 2004. It was released as a part of the four DVD set, ''The Lost Sex Films of Ed Wood Jr.'', by Alpha Blue Archives in July 2014.<ref name="piepenburg"/>
