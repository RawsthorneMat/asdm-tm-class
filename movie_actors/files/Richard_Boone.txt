'''Richard Allen Boone''' (June 18, 1917 – January 10, 1981) was an American actor who starred in over 50 films and was notable for his roles in Westerns and for starring in the TV series ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]''.

==Early life==
Boone was born in [[Los Angeles, California]], the middle child of Cecile (née Beckerman) and Kirk E. Boone, a well-to-do corporate lawyer.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~thekelsayfamilyt/The%20Kelsay%20Family/Biographies/Descendants%20of%20George%20W.%20Kelsay.htm</ref> His father was a descendant of a brother of frontiersmen [[Daniel Boone]] and [[Squire Boone]].<ref name=htif>{{Cite web|last=Bloom|first=Nate|authorlink=|title=Interfaith Celebrities: On and Off the Screens, Today and Yesteryear|publisher=InterfaithFamily.com|date=2012-03-06|url=http://www.interfaithfamily.com/arts_and_entertainment/popular_culture/Interfaith_Celebrities_On_and_Off_the_Screens_Today_and_Yesteryear.shtml|accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> His mother was Jewish, the daughter of immigrants from [[Russia]].<ref name=htif/><ref>http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=148193;article=18162</ref> Boone was a distant cousin of singer [[Pat Boone]], his daughter [[Debbie Boone]], and actor [[Randy Boone]], who are direct descendants of Daniel Boone.<ref>Woodland, Shannon and Ross, Scott. "BETWEEN THE LINER NOTES: Pat Boone and the New American Revolution". Christian Broadcasting Network. Retrieved 2007-05 07.</ref> Boone graduated from [[Herbert Hoover High School (Glendale)|Hoover High School]] in [[Glendale, California]]. He attended [[Stanford University]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], where he was a member of [[Theta Xi]] Fraternity, but left prior to graduation and tried his hand at oil-rigging, bartending, painting and writing before joining the [[United States Navy]] in 1941. He served on three ships in the Pacific during World War II, seeing combat as an aviation ordnanceman and gunner on [[TBM Avenger]] torpedo bombers. Boone is of English descent.

==Career==
After the war, he used the [[G.I. Bill]] to study acting at the [[Actors Studio]] in [[New York]]. Serious and methodical, Boone debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1947 in the play ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'' and appeared in ''[[Macbeth]]'' (1948) and ''[[The Man (play)|The Man]]'' (1950).

[[Elia Kazan]] used Boone to feed lines to an actress for a screen test for [[Lewis Milestone]]. Milestone was not impressed with the actress, but he was impressed enough with Boone's voice to summon him to Hollywood, where he was given a seven-year contract with Fox.<ref>p.14 Rothel</ref>

In 1950, Boone made his screen debut as a [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marine]] officer in Milestone's ''[[Halls of Montezuma (film)|Halls of Montezuma]]''. In 1953, he played [[Pontius Pilate]] in the first released [[Cinemascope]] film, ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''. He had only one scene in the film, in which he gives instructions to [[Richard Burton]], who plays the [[centurion]] ordered to crucify [[Christ]]. When he was ordered to appear in another film for Fox made at the same time as ''The Robe'', he ended his contract with the studio.<ref>Rothel p. 15</ref>

During the filming of ''Halls of Montezuma'' he befriended [[Jack Webb]], who was then producing and starring in ''[[Dragnet (TV series)|Dragnet]]''. The writer of ''Dragnet'' was preparing a series about a doctor for [[NBC]]. From 1954 to 1956, Boone became a familiar face in the lead role of that [[medical drama]], ''[[Medic (TV series)|Medic]]'',<ref>p.15 Rothel</ref> receiving an [[Emmy]] nomination for ''Best Actor Starring in a Regular Series'' in 1955. While on ''Medic'', he also guest starred as the character Everett Brayer on NBC<nowiki>'</nowiki>s ''[[Frontier (1955 TV series)|Frontier]]'' [[anthology series]], in the episode "The Salt War."

It was Boone's second television series, ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'', which made him a national star with his role as [[Have Gun – Will Travel#Paladin|Paladin]], the intelligent and sophisticated, but tough gun-for-hire in the late 19th century American west. The show was first offered to [[Randolph Scott]], who turned it down but gave the script to Boone while they were making the film ''[[Ten Wanted Men]]''.<ref>p.48 Rothel</ref> The show ran from 1957 to 1963, with Boone receiving two more Emmy nominations, in 1959 and 1960.

He starred in three movies with [[John Wayne]]: ''[[The Alamo (1960 film)|The Alamo]]'' (as [[Sam Houston]]), ''[[Big Jake (film)|Big Jake]]'', and ''[[The Shootist]]''.

During the 1960s, Boone appeared regularly on other television programs. He was an occasional guest panelist and also a mystery guest on ''What's My Line?'', the Sunday Night [[CBS-TV]] quiz show. On that show, he talked with host [[John Charles Daly]] about their days working together on the TV show ''[[The Front Page]]''. Boone also had his own television anthology, ''[[The Richard Boone Show]]''. Even though it aired only from 1963 to 1964, he received his fourth [[Emmy]] nomination in 1964. Along with ''[[Danny Kaye|The Danny Kaye Show]]'' and ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''The Richard Boone Show'' won a [[Golden Globe]] for Best Show in 1964.

After cancellation of his weekly show, Boone and his family moved to [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. While living on [[Oahu]], Boone helped persuade [[Leonard Freeman]] to film ''[[Hawaii Five-O]]'' exclusively in Hawaii. Prior to that, Freeman had planned to do "establishing" location shots in Hawaii but principal production in [[southern California]]. Boone and others convinced Freeman that the islands could offer all necessary support for a major TV series and would provide an authenticity otherwise unobtainable. Freeman, impressed by Boone's love of Hawaii, offered him the role of [[Steve McGarrett]]; Boone turned it down, however, and the role went to [[Jack Lord]], who shared Boone's enthusiasm, which Freeman considered vital. Coincidentally, Jack Lord had appeared with Boone in the first episode of ''Have Gun – Will Travel'', entitled "Three Bells to Perdido." Boone at that time had shot a pilot for CBS called ''Kona Coast'', that he hoped CBS would adopt as a series, but they went instead with ''Hawaii Five-0''.<ref>p.58 Rothel</ref>

The six-foot-one-inch (1.85-m) Boone continued to appear in movies, typically as the villain, including ''[[The Raid (1954 film)|The Raid]]'' (1954), ''[[Man Without a Star]]'' (1955 [[King Vidor]]), ''[[The Tall T]]'' (1957 [[Budd Boetticher]]), ''[[The War Lord]]'' (1965 [[Franklin Schaffner]]), ''[[Hombre (film)|Hombre]]'' (1967 [[Martin Ritt]]), ''[[The Arrangement (1969 film)|The Arrangement]]'' (1969 [[Elia Kazan]]), ''[[The Kremlin Letter]]'' (1970 [[John Huston]]), ''[[Big Jake (film)|Big Jake]]'' (1971 [[Michael Wayne]]), ''[[The Shootist]]'' (1976 [[Don Siegel]]), and a curiously tone deaf excessive Lance Canino in a second rendition of ''[[The Big Sleep]]'' (1978) [[Michael Winner]].

In the early 1970s, Boone starred in the short-lived TV series ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', which was about a turn-of-the-20th-century Western-style police detective who preferred to use his brain and criminal forensic skills instead of his gun.  Ramsey was frontier lawman and gunman in his younger days.  Now older Ramsey is the Deputy Chief of Police of a small Oklahoma city.  He is still a skilled shooter carrying a short barreled Colt Single Action Army revolver.  But Ramsey had embraced the science of criminal forensics and was a skilled criminalist using science to solve crimes.  He once wryly noted to an interviewer in 1972, "You know, Hec Ramsey is a lot like Paladin, only fatter."<ref>[http://members.aol.com/lloldham/quotes.html Quotes from and about Richard Boone]</ref> Boone returned to The [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] in New York, where he had once studied acting, to teach it in the mid 1970s.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Boone assisted the Israeli film industry, at its inception. He appeared in the first Israeli film set outside Israel, the Western ''[[Madron]]'' (1970), set in the American West in the 1800s.<ref name=htif/> In 1979, he received an award from Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], for his contribution to Israeli cinema.<ref name=htif/>

In 1965, he came in third in the [[Laurel Award]] for ''[[Rio Conchos (film)|Rio Conchos]]'' in Best Action Performance; [[Sean Connery]] won first place with ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' and [[Burt Lancaster]] won second place with ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]''.

Boone was also the voice actor for the dragon Smaug in the 1977 animated film of J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit".

==Personal life==
{{unreferenced|section frequently|date=May 2015}}
In his youth, Boone attended the [[San Diego Army and Navy Academy]] in [[Carlsbad, California]], near [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]]. It was there that Boone was introduced to theatre under the tutelage of Virginia Atkinson, who spawned theatre interest in many who eventually found their way to Hollywood. [[Robert Walker (actor)|Robert Walker]], another Academy graduate and member of the school’s theatre club, Masque & Wig, became a close acquaintance of Boone's.

Boone was married three times: to Jane Hopper (1937–1940), Mimi Kelly (1949–1950), and Claire McAloon (1951–81 (his death)).

In her 2004 autobiography "'Tis Herself", [[Maureen O'Hara]] wrote that Boone and [[Peter Lawford]] were arrested in a gay bar in Melbourne, Australia, while filming ''[[Kangaroo (1952 film)|Kangaroo]]''. The studio managed to prevent this from being reported by the press.<ref>O'Hara, Maureen '''Tis Herself: An Autobiography'' p. 141 (2004)</ref>

Boone's son with Claire McAloon, Peter, worked as a child actor in several of his father's ''Have Gun-Will Travel'' television shows. He resides in Virginia.

Boone moved to [[St. Augustine, Florida]], from Hawaii in 1970 and worked with the production of [[Cross and Sword]], when he was not acting on television or in movies, until his death in 1981. In the last year of his life, Boone was appointed Florida's cultural ambassador.<ref>[http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity-biography/richard-boone.1/ MSN Movies: Celebrities-Richard Boone]</ref> During the 1970s, he wrote a newspaper column for the ''St. Augustine Record'' called "It Seems To Me." He also gave acting lectures at [[Flagler College]] in 1972–1973.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/richard-boone/person/61528/biography.html TV-dot-Com: Biography-Richard Boone]</ref> In his final role, Boone played [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry]] in ''[[Bushido Blade (movie)|Bushido Blade]]''. He died soon afterward in St. Augustine of [[pneumonia]] while suffering from [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]]. His ashes were scattered in the [[Pacific Ocean]] off Hawaii.
