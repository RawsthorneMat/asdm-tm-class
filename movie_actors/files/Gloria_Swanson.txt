'''Gloria May Josephine Swanson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|ɑː|n|s|ən}}; March 27, 1899<!--'1899' is correct, see talk page discussion--> – April 4, 1983) was an American actress, singer, and producer perhaps best known for her role as Norma Desmond, a reclusive silent film star, in the critically acclaimed 1950 film, ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''. She was one of the most prominent stars during the [[silent film]] era as both an actress and a fashion icon, especially under the direction of [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. She starred in dozens of silent films and was nominated for the first [[Academy Award]] in the Best Actress category. She also produced her own films, including ''[[Sadie Thompson]]'' and ''[[The Love of Sunya]].''  In 1929, Swanson transitioned to [[talkie]]s with ''[[The Trespasser]].''  Personal problems and changing tastes saw her popularity wane during the 1930s when she moved into theater and television.

==Early life==
'''Gloria May Josephine Swanson'''<ref name="biodata">{{cite book|last=Cornell Sarvady|first=Andrea|author2=Miller, Frank |author3=Haskell, Molly |author4= Osborne, Robert |title=Leading Ladies: The 50 Most Unforgettable Actresses of the Studio Era|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2006|page=185|isbn=0-8118-5248-2}}</ref> was born in a small house in Chicago in 1899 to Adelaide (née Klanowski) and Joseph Theodore Swanson, a soldier. She attended [[Hawthorne Scholastic Academy]]. Her father was from a strict [[Lutheran]] [[Swedish American]] family, and her mother was of German, French, and [[Polish people|Polish]] ancestry.<ref name="ref2">{{cite book|last=Quirk|first=Lawrence J.|title=The Films of Gloria Swanson|publisher=Citadel Press|year=1984|page=256|isbn=0-8065-0874-4}}</ref><ref name="ref1">{{cite book|last=Harzig|first=Christiane|title=Peasant Maids, City Women|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1996|page=283|isbn=0-8014-8395-6}}</ref>

Because of her father's attachment to the U.S. Army, the family moved frequently and Swanson ended up spending most of her childhood in [[Puerto Rico]], where she learned Spanish. She also spent time in [[Key West, Florida]]. It was not her intention to enter show business, but on a whim one of her aunts took her to a small film company in Chicago called [[Essanay Studios]] for a visit and Swanson was asked to come back to work as an [[extra (actor)|extra]].<ref name="ref3">{{cite book|last=Swanson|first=Gloria|title=Swanson on Swanson|publisher=Random House|year=1981|isbn=0-394-50662-6|location=Chapter 2}}</ref> After a few months as an extra working with others like [[Charlie Chaplin]], and making $13.50 a week, Swanson left school to work full-time at the studio. Her parents would soon separate and she and her mother moved to California.<ref name="ref4">{{cite book|last=Beauchamp|first=Cari|title=Joseph P.

==Career==
===Early years===
[[File:Swanson-Change Husband.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Gloria Swanson in a production still from the film, ''[[Don't Change Your Husband]]'' (1919)]]
[[File:G.Swanson Change Wife.jpg|thumb|200px|Gloria Swanson in a production still from the film, ''[[Why Change Your Wife?]]'' (1920)]]
Swanson made her film debut in 1914 as an extra in ''The Song of Soul'' for [[Essanay]]. She reportedly asked to be in the movie just for fun. Essanay hired her to feature in several movies, including ''His New Job'', directed by and starring [[Charlie Chaplin]]. Swanson auditioned for the leading female role in ''His New Job,'' but Chaplin did not view her as leading lady material and cast Swanson in the brief role of a stenographer. Swanson moved to California in 1916 to appear in [[Mack Sennett]]'s [[Keystone Studios|Keystone]] comedies opposite [[Bobby Vernon]], and in 1919 she signed with [[Paramount Pictures]] and worked often with [[Cecil B. DeMille]], who turned her into a romantic lead in such films as ''[[Don't Change Your Husband]]'' (1919), ''[[Male and Female]]'' (1919) with the famous scene posing as "the Lion's Bride" with a real lion, ''[[Why Change Your Wife?]]'' (1920), ''[[Something to Think About]]'' (1920), and ''[[The Affairs of Anatol]]'' (1921).

In the space of two years, Swanson rocketed to stardom and was one of the most sought-after actresses in Hollywood. She later appeared in a series of films directed by [[Sam Wood]]. She starred in ''[[Beyond the Rocks (film)|Beyond the Rocks]]'' (1922) with her long-time friend [[Rudolph Valentino]]. (Long believed to be a [[lost film]], ''Beyond the Rocks'' was rediscovered in 2004 in a private collection in The Netherlands and is now available on DVD.) Swanson continued to make costume drama films for the next few years. So successful were her films for Paramount that the studio was afraid of losing her and gave in to many of her whims and wishes.<ref>Swanson 1981, see for example pp. 9, 93–95, 98, 131, 192</ref>

During Swanson's heyday, audiences went to her films not only for her performances, but also to see her wardrobe. Frequently, ornamented with beads, jewels, [[peacock]] and [[ostrich]] feathers, and other extravagant pieces ''[[haute couture]]'' of the day, one would hardly believe Swanson was barely five feet (1.52 m) tall. Her fashion, hair styles, and jewels were copied around the world. She was the screen's first [[clothes horse]] and was becoming one of the most famous and photographed women in the world.<ref>see ''Four Fabulous Faces: Swanson, Garbo, Crawford, Dietrich'' by Larry Carr, 1970, Galahad Books, ISBN 0-88365-044-4 and ''Without Lying Down: Frances Marion and the Powerful Women of Early Hollywood'' by Cari Beauchamp, University of California Press, 1998, ISBN 0-520-21492-7</ref>

In 1925, Swanson starred in the [[French-American]] ''[[Madame Sans-Gene (1925 film)|Madame Sans-Gêne]]'', directed by [[Léonce Perret]]. Filming was allowed for the first time at many of the historic sites relating to Napoleon. While it was well received at the time, no prints are known to exist, and it is unfortunately considered to be a [[lost film]]. During the production of ''Madame Sans-Gêne,'' Swanson met her third husband [[Henry de la Falaise|Henri, Marquis de la Falaise]], who had been hired to be her translator during the film's production. After a four months residency in France she returned to the United States as European nobility, now known as the Marquise. She got a huge welcome home with parades in both New York and Los Angeles. Swanson appeared in a 1925 short produced by [[Lee DeForest]] in his [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film process. She made a number of films for Paramount, among them ''[[The Coast of Folly (1925 film)|The Coast of Folly]],'' ''[[Stage Struck (1925 film)|Stage Struck]]'' and ''Fine Manners.''{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1927, she decided to turn down a million dollar a year contract with Paramount to join the newly created [[United Artists]], where she was her own boss and could make the films she wanted, with whom she wanted, and when. Her first independent film, ''[[The Love of Sunya]]'', was directed by [[Albert Parker (director)|Albert Parker]], based on the play ''The Eyes of Youth,'' by [[Max Marcin]] and Charles Guernon. Produced by and starring Swanson, it co-starred [[John Boles (actor)|John Boles]] and [[Pauline Garon]]. It is the story of a young woman granted the ability to see into her future, including her future with different men. The story had been filmed previously as ''[[Eyes of Youth]]'' starring [[Clara Kimball Young]] (that production was also directed by Albert Parker and was responsible for the discovery of [[Rudolph Valentino]] by [[June Mathis]]). The production was marred by several problems, mainly a suitable cameraman to deal with the film's intricate double exposures, as Swanson was not used to taking charge, and filming took place in New York. The film premiered at the grand opening of the [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in New York City on March 11, 1927. (Swanson was pictured in the ruins of the Roxy on October 14, 1960, during the demolition of the theater, in a famous photo taken by [[Time-Life]] photographer Eliot Elisofon and published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine.) The production had been a disaster and Swanson felt its success would be mediocre at best.<ref name="Swanson 1981 294">{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=294}}</ref> On the advice of [[Joseph Schenck]], Swanson returned to Hollywood, where Schenck begged her to film something more commercial. She agreed but ended up filming the more controversial ''[[Sadie Thompson]]'' instead.<ref name="Swanson 1981 294"/>

===''Sadie Thompson''===
[[File:Gloria Swanson-James Abbe 1921.jpg|thumb|Swanson in 1922]]
{{main|Sadie Thompson}}
Feeling she would never have as much artistic freedom and independence as she had at that moment, Swanson decided she "wanted to make my ''[[The Gold Rush|Gold Rush]].'' "<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=295}}</ref> Schenck pleaded with her to do a commercially successful film like ''The Last of Mrs. Cheyney.''  Swanson felt it was too formulaic, and decided to call on director [[Raoul Walsh]], who was signed with [[Fox Film Corporation]] at the time.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=295–296}}</ref> Walsh had been known for bringing controversial material to film, and at their first meeting suggested the [[John Colton (screenwriter)|John Colton/Clemence Randolph]] play ''Rain'' (1923), based on a story by [[W. Somerset Maugham]] in 1921 titled ''Miss Thompson''. She had seen [[Jeanne Eagels]] perform the role twice, and enjoyed it.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=297}}</ref>

Because of its content, producing the film under the tight restrictions of the [[Hays Code]] would be almost impossible. The play was on the unofficial blacklist, and had quietly been banned from film-making a year earlier.<ref name="Swanson 1981 305">{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=305}}</ref> To try to avoid issues with the code, Swanson and Walsh decided to leave out profanity, rename 'Reverend Davidson' 'Mr. Davidson,' and claim it was in the interest of morality to produce the picture as [[Irving Thalberg]] had produced ''[[The Scarlet Letter (1926 film)|The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1926) at MGM.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=297–302}}</ref>

Swanson invited Will Hays for lunch and summarized the plot, naming the author and the sticking points. According to Swanson, Hays made a verbal promise he would have no problem with the making of such a film.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=302}}</ref> Swanson set out to get the rights to the play by having Schenck pretend to buy it in the name of [[United Artists]], never to be used.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=303–304}}</ref> They were able to obtain the story rights for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000. When news broke concerning just what was intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue.<ref name="Swanson 1981 294"/><ref name="Swanson 1981 305"/> Swanson later contacted Maugham about rights to a sequel, and he offered to grant them for $25,000. Maugham claimed Fox had asked about a sequel at the same time Swanson had bought the original story's rights. The sequel was to follow the further exploits of Sadie in Australia, but was never made.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=323}}</ref>

[[File:Swanson early.JPG|thumb|left|Swanson c. 1920s]]
Swanson and Walsh set about writing the script,<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=304}}</ref> and discreetly placed an ad announcing the film, thinking no one noticed, as [[Charles Lindbergh]] had just completed his historic transatlantic flight. However, the press picked up on it and sensationalized the story.<ref name="Swanson 1981 305"/> [[United Artists]] received a threatening two-page telegram from the [[MPAA]] signed by all its members, including Fox (Walsh's studio) and Hays himself. In addition, the rest of the signers owned several thousand movie houses, and if they refused to screen the film it could be a financial disaster.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=305–306}}</ref> This was the first time Swanson had heard the name of [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], with whom she later had an affair, and who arranged financing for her next few pictures, including ''[[Queen Kelly]]'' (1929).<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=308–309}}</ref>

Swanson was angered by the response, as she felt those very studios had produced questionable films themselves, and were jealous at not having the chance to produce ''Rain''.<ref name="Swanson 1981 307">{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=307}}</ref> After another threatening telegram, she decided to first appeal to the MPAA, and then the newspapers.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=309}}</ref> She only heard back from [[Marcus Loew]], who promised to appeal on her behalf, and since he owned a chain of theatres this eased some of her concerns. Figuring the silence meant the matter had been dropped, Swanson began filming on ''Sadie Thompson'' which already had $250,000 invested in it.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=3011–312}}</ref> Before casting began, the young [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]] wanted to audition for the role of Handsome O'Hara.<ref name="Swanson 1981 307"/> However, Swanson felt he was too young and not right for the role.<ref name="Swanson 1981 313">{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=313}}</ref> [[Lionel Barrymore]] had been first picked to play Davidson but was thought to be too ill at the time, though he eventually won the role.<ref name="Swanson 1981 313"/> Barrymore wore the same outfit for an entire week, aggravating Swanson. She asked some of the crew to tell him to change and wash, which he did.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=320–321}}</ref> Aside from this, Swanson was happy with his performance. Walsh had not appeared in front of a camera in eight years, and feared he would not be able to direct and act at the same time. However, two days into filming, his fears had disappeared.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=317–318}}</ref>

Much of the filming took place on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]] near [[Long Beach, California]]. Swanson took ill shortly after, and met a doctor who started her lifelong love of [[macrobiotic]] diets.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=313–317}}</ref>  A week into shooting, [[Sam Goldwyn]] called cameraman George Barnes away. Swanson was furious, but the loan contract had allowed Goldwyn to call him away as he pleased.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=319–320}}</ref> Not wanting to let a hundred extras sit around for days, Swanson and Walsh tried to hire two more cameramen, but both were unsatisfactory. [[Mary Pickford]] had offered the services of her favorite cameraman [[Charles Rosher]], who was called in but despite doing a decent job couldn't match Barnes' work.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=320}}</ref> Swanson, remembering the kindness showed by Marcus Loew during the telegram affair, turned to him again, desperate for help. Although Loew was sick and would soon pass away, he told MGM to give her anyone she wanted. MGM loaned her Oliver Marsh and he completed the picture.<ref name="Swanson 1981 321">{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=321}}</ref>

The cameraman fiasco was extremely costly to the production, yet shooting continued. With the picture half finished, it was already well over budget, and Schenck was wary, as Swanson's first picture had also been over budget and underperformed. Swanson talked with her advisors and sold her home in [[Croton-on-Hudson, New York]], and offered to sell her New York City penthouse as well.<ref name="Swanson 1981 321"/>
[[Image:Sadiethompsonlobbycard.jpg|left|thumb|A ''Sadie Thompson'' lobby card (1928)]]
Despite reports that "dirty" words can be read on the characters' lips, Swanson claims the censors went over everything with a fine-tooth comb.<ref name="Swanson 1981 322">{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=322}}</ref> However, Swanson admitted that one line she was shouting at Davidson went, ''"You'd rip the wings off of a butterfly, you son of a bitch!"'' when recounting a conversation with Walsh later in life.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=499}}</ref> If the word rain was used in a title, they asked that it be removed. They also wanted to change Davidson's name to something else, but Swanson and Walsh refused.<ref name="Swanson 1981 322"/>

The film was a success and was the only silent independent film of Swanson's to do well at the box office. It was one of her last financially successful films, including the talkies ''[[The Trespasser]]'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Blvd]]''.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=407}}</ref> It went on to make $1,000,000 during its US run.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019344/business</ref> However, at Kennedy's advice, Swanson had sold her distribution rights for the film to Schenck, as Kennedy felt it would be a commercial failure.<ref name="Swanson 1981 374">{{harv|Swanson|1981|p=374}}</ref> He also didn't care for the image Swanson portrayed in the film. By this point, ''[[Queen Kelly]]'' had been a disaster, and Swanson regretted it.<ref name="Swanson  1981 374"/>  The film made the top ten best pictures of the year list as well. It was Raoul Walsh's final role, as he subsequently lost an eye in an accident. The film was nominated for awards for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress in a Leading Role]] (Gloria Swanson) and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]]. Swanson did not attend the ceremony, and always felt it was like "comparing apples to oranges".<ref name="Swanson 1981 374"/>  Contemporary reviews called it racy but excellent, and praised Swanson's performance.<ref>[http://www.silentsaregolden.com/sadiethompsonreview.html ''Sadie Thompson'' review]</ref> At present, the film, save for the final reel (stopping just after Davidson finds Sadie in his room), exists in good condition.

===''Queen Kelly''===
One of the best known of Hollywood's unfinished films, ''[[Queen Kelly]]'' (1929), was directed by [[Erich von Stroheim]] and produced by [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]], father of the future [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. Produced in 1928–29, the film starred Swanson in the title role, with Walter Byron and [[Seena Owen]]. It is the story of Prince Wolfram, betrothed to the mad Queen Regina V of Kronberg. On maneuvers (as punishment for consorting with other women), he spies Kelly walking with the other students of a convent. Enthralled by her beauty, he kidnaps her that night from the convent, takes her to his room and professes his love for her. When the Queen finds them together the next morning, she whips Kelly and throws her out of the castle. Queen Regina then puts Wolfram in prison for his refusal to marry her. Kelly goes to German East Africa to visit her dying Aunt, and is forced to marry the disgusting Jan. The Aunt dies after the wedding, and Kelly refuses to live with Jan, becoming the head of her aunt's brothel. Her extravagances and style earn her the name Queen Kelly.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Films of Gloria Swanson |last=Quirk|first=Lawrence|year=1984|publisher=Citidal|isbn= 978-0806508740 |pages=211–214}}</ref>

Production of the costly film was shut down after complaints by Swanson about von Stroheim and the general direction the film was taking. Though the European scenes were full of innuendo, and featured a philandering prince and a sex-crazed queen, the scenes set in Africa were grim and, Swanson felt, distasteful. In later interviews, Swanson claimed that she had been misled by the script, which referred to her character arriving in, and taking over, a dance hall; looking at the rushes, it was obvious the 'dance hall' was actually a brothel.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=388–392}}</ref>

Stroheim was fired from the film, and the African storyline was scrapped. Swanson and Kennedy still wanted to salvage the European material, as it had been so costly and time-consuming, and had potential market value. An alternate ending was shot on November 24, 1931.<ref>{{cite book|title=Joseph P Kennedy Presents|last=Beauchamp|first=Cari|year=2009|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-1-4000-4000-1|pages=242–250, especially 247}}</ref> In this ending, directed by Swanson and photographed by [[Gregg Toland]], Prince Wolfram is shown visiting the palace. A nun leads him to the chapel, where Kelly's body lies in state. This has been called the "Swanson ending." The film was not theatrically released in the United States, but it was shown in Europe and South America with the Swanson ending tacked on. This was due to a clause in Stroheim's contract.<ref>IMDB and SilentEra websites</ref>

A short extract of the film appears in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950), representing an old silent picture Swanson's character [[Norma Desmond]]—herself a silent movie star—had made. Von Stroheim is also a primary character in ''Sunset Boulevard'' as her ex-director, ex-husband, and current butler. In the 1960s, it was shown on television with the Swanson ending, along with a taped introduction and conclusion in which Swanson spoke about the history of the project. By 1985, [[Kino International (company)|Kino International]] had acquired the rights to the movie and restored two versions: one that uses still photos  and subtitles in an attempt to wrap up the storyline, and the other the European "suicide ending" version. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Sound era===
On March 29, 1929, at the bungalow of [[Mary Pickford]] at [[United Artists]], Swanson, Pickford, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Norma Talmadge]], [[John Barrymore]], [[Dolores del Río]] and [[D.W. Griffith]] met to speak on the radio show, ''The Dodge Brothers Hour'', to prove they could meet the challenge of talking movies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ramon|first=David|title=Dolores del Río|publisher=Clío|year=1997|isbn=968-6932-35-6}}</ref> To try to recover from the ''Queen Kelly'' fiasco, Swanson jumped into making [[talkies]], including ''[[The Trespasser]]'' (1929), ''What a Widow!'' (1930), ''[[Indiscreet (1931 film)|Indiscreet]]'' (1931), ''[[Perfect Understanding]]'' (1933), and ''[[Music in the Air]]'' (1934).

''[[The Trespasser]]'' tells the story of a "kept woman" who maintains a lavish lifestyle. The film stars Swanson, [[Robert Ames]], [[Purnell Pratt]], [[Henry B. Walthall]], and [[Wally Albright]]. The movie was written and directed by [[Edmund Goulding]] and released by [[United Artists]], and earned Swanson an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination in her talkie debut. Swanson sang the song "Love, Your Magic Spell Is Everywhere" written by Goulding and [[Elsie Janis]]. ''The Trespasser'' was filmed simultaneously in a silent and a talking version, and was a smash hit.

''The Trespasser'' was an important film for Swanson, following the disastrous ''Queen Kelly'' and the hit ''Sadie Thompson'', and garnered Swanson her second Oscar nomination. Sadly for Swanson, ''The Trespasser'' proved to be one of her only two hit talkies, the other being ''Sunset Boulevard'', made over 20 years later. Subsequent follow-ups like ''What a Widow!'', ''Indiscreet'', ''[[Tonight or Never (1931 film)|Tonight or Never]]'', ''Perfect Understanding'', and ''Music in the Air'' all proved to be box-office flops. Despite the disappointments following ''The Trespasser,'' Swanson was well remembered by [[Billy Wilder]], a writer on ''Music in the Air'', when he was casting the part of Norma Desmond in his masterpiece ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950).

[[File:Gloria Swanson & Billy Wilder - ca. 1950.JPG|thumb|With director [[Billy Wilder]] during the filming of ''Sunset Boulevard'']]
Although she made the transition to talkies, as her film career began to decline, Swanson relocated permanently to New York City in 1938, where she began an inventions and patents company called Multiprises, which kept her occupied during the years of World War II. This small company had the sole purpose of rescuing Jewish scientists and inventors from war-torn Europe and bringing them to the United States. She helped many escape, and some useful inventions came from the enterprise.

Swanson made another film for [[RKO Radio Pictures]] in 1941, began appearing in the legitimate theater, and starred in her own television show in 1948. She threw herself into painting and sculpting, writing a syndicated column, touring in [[summer stock]], engaging in political activism, radio and television work, clothing and accessories design and marketing, and making occasional appearances on the big screen. But it was not until 1950 when ''[[Sunset Boulevard]]'' was released (earning her yet another Academy Award nomination) that she achieved mass recognition again.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[File:Sunset Boulevard 17.jpg|thumb|Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond in ''Sunset Boulevard'' (1950)]]
After [[Mae West]], [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Pola Negri]] all declined the role,<ref>{{cite book|last=Staggs|first=Sam |title=Close-up on Sunset Boulevard: Billy Wilder, Norma Desmond, and the Dark Hollywood Dream|publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|page=54|isbn=0-312-30254-1}}</ref> Swanson starred in 1950's ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', portraying Norma Desmond, a faded silent movie star who falls in love with the younger screenwriter Joe Gillis, played by [[William Holden]]. Desmond lives in the past, assisted by her butler Max, played by [[Erich von Stroheim]]. Her dreams of a comeback are subverted as she becomes [[delusional]]. There are cameos from actors of the silent era in the film, including [[Buster Keaton]], [[H. B. Warner]] and [[Anna Q. Nilsson]]. [[Cecil B. DeMille]] plays himself in a pivotal scene. Some of the lines from the film have become pop-culture mainstays, including "The Greatest Star of them all"; "I am big; it's the pictures that got small"; "We didn't need dialogue, we had faces"; and "All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up." She received her third Best Actress Oscar nomination, but lost to [[Judy Holliday]] for ''[[Born Yesterday (1950 film)|Born Yesterday]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Staggs|first=Sam|title=Close-up on Sunset Boulevard: Billy Wilder, Norma Desmond, and the Dark Hollywood Dream|publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|page=70|isbn=0-312-30254-1}}</ref>

Swanson received several subsequent acting offers but turned most of them down, saying they tended to be pale imitations of Norma Desmond. Her last major Hollywood motion picture role was the poorly received ''[[Three for Bedroom "C"]]'' in 1952.<ref>{{cite journal |last= J.C.|first=|title= New Film Comedy Takes Gloria Swanson for a Ride|journal=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|volume= | issue = |date=June 27, 1952|pages=7}}</ref> In 1956, Swanson made ''[[Nero's Mistress]]'', which also starred [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Vittorio de Sica]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]]. Her final screen appearance was as herself in ''[[Airport 1975]]''. Although Swanson only made three films after ''Sunset Boulevard'', she starred in numerous stage and television productions during her remaining years. She was active in various business ventures, traveled extensively, wrote articles, columns, and an autobiography, painted and sculpted, and became a passionate advocate of various health and nutrition topics.

===Television and theater===
[[File:Fred MacMurray Gloria Swanson My Three Sons 1965.JPG|thumb|left|Swanson with [[Fred MacMurray]] in the promo of ''[[My Three Sons]]'' (1965)]]
Swanson hosted one of the first [[live television]] series in 1948, ''The Gloria Swanson Hour'', in which she invited friends and others to be guests. Swanson also later hosted a television anthology series, ''Crown Theatre with Gloria Swanson'', in which she occasionally acted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kashner|first=Sam |author2=MacNair, Jennifer|title=The Bad & the Beautiful: Hollywood in the Fifties|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=2003|page=345|isbn=0-393-32436-2}}</ref>

Through the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s, Swanson appeared on many different talk and variety shows such as ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' in 1973 and ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' to recollect her films and to lampoon them as well. She was twice the "mystery guest" on ''[[What's My Line]]''. She acted in "Behind the Locked Door" on ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' in 1964, and in the same year was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] award for her performance in ''[[Burke's Law]]''. She made a guest appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' in the summer of 1970; a guest on the same show as [[Janis Joplin]], who died later that year.<ref>{{YouTube|vlqAsesmLQ0|Gloria Swanson on ''The Dick Cavett Show''}}</ref>

She made a notable appearance in a 1966 episode of ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', called "The Gloria Swanson Story", in which she plays herself. In the episode, the Clampetts mistakenly believe Swanson is destitute, and decide to finance a comeback movie for her – in a silent film. Her last acting role, aside from playing herself in ''[[Airport 1975]]'', was in the made-for-TV [[horror film]] ''[[Killer Bees (1974 film)|Killer Bees]]'' (1974). After near-retirement from films, Swanson appeared in many plays throughout her later life, beginning in the 1940s. She toured with ''A Goose for the Gander'', ''Reflected Glory'', and ''Let Us Be Gay''. After her success with ''Sunset Boulevard'', she starred on Broadway in a revival of ''[[Twentieth Century (play)|Twentieth Century]]'' (1951) with [[Jose Ferrer]], and in ''Nina'' with [[David Niven]]. Her last major stage role was in the 1971 Broadway production of ''[[Butterflies Are Free (play)|Butterflies Are Free]]'' at the [[Booth Theatre]].

In 1980, Swanson's autobiography, ''Swanson on Swanson'', was published and became a commercial success. [[Kevin Brownlow]] and [[David Gill (film historian)|David Gill]] interviewed her for ''[[Hollywood (1980 TV series)|Hollywood]]'' (1980), a television history of the silent era.

==Personal life==
[[File:Gloria Swanson Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|right|Swanson in her [[New York City]] apartment (1972)]]
Swanson became a vegetarian around 1928 and was an early [[health food]] advocate who was known for bringing her own meals to public functions in a paper bag. Swanson told actor [[Dirk Benedict]] about [[macrobiotic diet]]s when he was battling [[prostate cancer]] at a very early age. He had refused conventional therapies and credited this kind of diet and healthy eating with his recovery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Benedict|first=Dirk|title=Confessions of a Kamikase Cowboy|publisher=Avery Publishing Group|year=1991}}</ref> In 1975, Swanson traveled the United States and helped to promote the book ''[[Sugar Blues]]'' written by her husband, William Dufty.

In early 1980, Swanson's 520-page autobiography, ''Swanson on Swanson'', was published by Random House and became a national best-seller. It was translated into French, Italian and Swedish editions. That same year, she also designed a stamp cachet for the United Nations Postal Administration and chaired the New York chapter of ''Seniors for Reagan-Bush.''<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19801001&id=DmwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uisEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6791,1636072 "Show Business"] ''The Milwaukee Journal'', October 1, 1980.</ref>

===Religion===
Swanson was a long-time member of the [[Lutheran]] church; her father was of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] Lutheran descent.<ref>{{harv|Swanson|1981|pp=304–305}}</ref> In 1964, Swanson spoke at a "Project Prayer" rally attended by 2,500 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles. The gathering, which was hosted by [[Anthony Eisley]], a star of ABC's ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'' series, sought to flood the [[United States Congress]] with letters in support of [[school prayer]], following two decisions in 1962 and 1963 of the [[United States Supreme Court]], which struck down the practice as in conflict with the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=pearson>{{cite web|url=http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/50658/b18f14-0514zdisplay.pdf|title="The Washington Merry-Go-Round", Drew Pearson column, May 14, 1964|publisher=dspace.wrlc.org|accessdate=January 13, 2013}}</ref> Joining Swanson and Eisley at the Project Prayer rally were [[Walter Brennan]], [[Lloyd Nolan]], [[Rhonda Fleming]], [[Pat Boone]], and [[Dale Evans]]. Swanson declared, "Under God we became the freest, strongest, wealthiest nation on earth, should we change that?"<ref name=pearson/>

===Marriages and relationships===
Throughout her life and her many marriages, Swanson was always known as Miss Swanson. Though she legally took the names of her husbands, her own personality and fame always overshadowed them. Her first husband was the actor [[Wallace Beery]], whom she married on her 17th birthday. In her autobiography ''Swanson on Swanson,'' Swanson wrote that Beery raped her on their wedding night. He also impregnated her in 1917. Not wanting her to have the child, he reportedly tricked her into drinking a concoction that induced an abortion and although they still worked together at Sennett, they separated and finally divorced two years later.

She married Herbert K. Somborn (1881–1934), then president of Equity Pictures Corporation and later the owner of the [[Brown Derby]] restaurant, in 1919. Their daughter, Gloria Swanson Somborn (October 7, 1920 – December 28, 2000),<ref>[http://thepeerage.com/p29875.htm#i298743 ''thepeerage.com'' on Gloria Somborn Anderson, daughter of Gloria Swanson and Herbert Somborn] Retrieved May 1, 2015</ref> was born in 1920. Their divorce, finalized in January 1925, was sensational and led to Swanson having a "morals clause" added to her studio contract. Somborn accused her of adultery with thirteen men including [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Rudolph Valentino]], and [[Marshall Neilan]]. During their divorce Swanson wanted another child and in 1923 she adopted a baby boy, Sonny Smith (1922–1975), whom she renamed Joseph Patrick Swanson.

Swanson's third husband was the French aristocrat [[Henri de la Falaise|Henri, Marquis de la Falaise de la Coudraye]], whom she married on January 28, 1925 after the Somborn divorce was finalized. Though Henri was a Marquis and the grandson of Richard and Martha Lucy Hennessy from the famous Hennessy Cognac family, he was not rich and had to work for a living.<ref>"Debrett Goes to Hollywood", 1986, St. Martin's Press, pp. 24–25</ref> He was originally hired to be her assistant and interpreter in France while she was filming ''[[Madame Sans-Gene (1925 film)|Madame Sans-Gêne]]'' (1925). Swanson was the first film star to marry European nobility, and the marriage became a global sensation. She conceived a child with him, but had an abortion, which, in her autobiography, she said she regretted.

Later, Henri became a film executive representing [[Pathé]] (USA) in France through [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]], who was running the studio. Many now assume he was given the position, which kept him in France for ten months a year, to simply keep him out of the way.<ref>''Joseph P. Kennedy Presents'', 2009, knopf, pp. 175, 275</ref> This marriage ended in divorce in 1930<ref>''Swanson on Swanson'', 1981, Random House, p. 419<!-- isbn needed --></ref> Soon after, Henri remarried, to actress [[Constance Bennett]].
While still married to Henri, Swanson had an affair with the married Joseph P. Kennedy for a number of years. He became her business partner and their relationship was an open secret in Hollywood. He took over all of her personal and business affairs and was supposed to make her millions. Unfortunately, Kennedy left her after the disastrous ''Queen Kelly'' and her finances were in worse shape than when he came into her life. Two books have been written about the affair.<ref>See, for example, ''Gloria and Joe: The Star-Crossed Love Affair of Gloria Swanson and Joe Kennedy'' by Axel Madsen, 1988 (ISBN 0877959463) or ''Joseph P. Kennedy Presents: His Hollywood Years'' by Cari Beauchamp, 2009 (ISBN 1400040000)</ref>

After the marriage to Henri and her affair with Kennedy were over, Swanson married Michael Farmer (1902–1975) in August 1931. Because of the possibility that Swanson's divorce from La Falaise had not been final at the time of the wedding, she was forced to remarry Farmer the following November, by which time she was four months pregnant with Michelle Bridget Farmer, who was born on April 5, 1932.<ref>[http://thepeerage.com/p29877.htm#i298766 Michelle Bridget Farmer; thepeerage.com] Retrieved May 1, 2015</ref> Swanson and Farmer divorced in 1934, after she became involved with married British actor [[Herbert Marshall]]. The media reported widely on her affair with Marshall.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Sonia|title=Scared of Spring|journal=Picture Play Magazine|date=April 1935|volume=42|page=70|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/pictureplay4143stre#page/n311/mode/2up/search/%22herbert+marshall%22|accessdate=23 August 2014|quote=Hollywood is wondering if Gloria Swanson, once free of Michael Farmer, will make Herbert husband Number Five}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peak|first1=Mayme Ober|title='To Be Called Sauve Gets on My Nerves'|journal=Daily Boston Globe|date=13 January 1935|page=B5|quote=Now the Marshalls are separated by more than an ocean and continent.

In 1945, Swanson married William N. Davey and according to her after discovering Davey in a drunken stupor, she and daughter Michelle, believing they were being helpful, left a trail of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] literature around the apartment. Davey quickly packed up and left.<ref>''Swanson on Swanson,'' 1981, Random House, p. 472</ref> Swanson-Davey divorce was finalized in 1946.<ref>Debrett Goes to Hollywood,'' 1986, St. Martin's Press, p. 29</ref> For the next thirty years Swanson would remain unmarried and able to pursue her own interests.

Swanson's final marriage occurred in 1976 and lasted until her death. Her sixth husband and widower, writer [[William Dufty]] (1916–2002), was the co-author of [[Billie Holiday]]'s autobiography ''Lady Sings the Blues,'' the author of ''[[Sugar Blues]],'' a 1975 best-selling health book still in print, and the author of the English version of [[Georges Ohsawa]]'s ''You Are All Sanpaku.''

Dufty was a book ghost-writer and newspaperman, working for many years at the ''New York Post,'' where he was assistant to the editor from 1951 to 1960. He first met Swanson in 1965 and by 1967 the two were living together as a couple. Swanson shared her husband's deep enthusiasm for [[macrobiotic diet]]s and they traveled widely together to speak about sugar and food. They promoted his book ''Sugar Blues'' together in 1975 and also wrote a syndicated column together.<ref>''Sugar Blues'', 1975, Chilton, pp. 1–2</ref> It was through ''Sugar Blues'' that Dufty and Swanson first got to know [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]. Swanson testified on his <!-- whose behalf--Lennon?? -->behalf at his immigration hearing in New York which led to him becoming a [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent resident]].<ref>''Vanity Fair,'' November 2001, "John Lennon—The Collected Interviews: 1973–80" by Lisa Robinson</ref>

Dufty ghost-wrote Swanson's best-selling 1980 autobiography, ''Swanson on Swanson'',<ref name=LAT/> based on her early, sometimes handwritten drafts and notes. She personally revised the manuscript several times.<ref>(Welsch 2013, p. 396). "Swanson produced many draft versions of her autobiography over many years. There are holographs [handwritten manuscripts] as well as typescripts, notes, and lists, many annotated in her hand. I have referred to these in the notes as 'GS manuscript,' indicating when relevant her efforts at revision or deletion."</ref> They were prominent socialites, having many homes and living in many places, including New York City, Rome, Portugal, and [[Palm Springs, California]]. After Swanson's death Dufty returned to his former home in Birmingham, Michigan. He died of cancer in 2002.<ref name=LAT>[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jul/04/local/me-dufty4 Obituary for William Dufty by Myrna Oliver, ''Los Angeles Times'', July 4, 2002.]</ref>

===Political views===
Swanson was a staunch [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and supported the 1940 and 1944 campaigns for president of [[Wendell Willkie]], and the 1964 presidential campaign of [[Barry Goldwater]].<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uc4TAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA368&lpg=PA368&dq=Gloria+Swanson+Republican&source=bl&ots=w7zp4UED0o&sig=Fj698YjWT0Vs99Ri6lunB35iLBY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FkTOVJynHY2GyASDpYLoAg&ved=0CGAQ6AEwDw#v=onepage&q=Gloria%20Swanson%20Republican&f=false</ref>

==Death==
Shortly after returning to New York from her home in Portugal, on April 4, 1983, Swanson died in New York City in [[New York Hospital]] from a heart ailment, aged 84.<ref name=obit>{{cite news|author=[[Peter B.

After Swanson's death, there were a series of auctions from August to September 1983 at [[William Doyle Galleries]] in New York of the star's furniture and decorations, jewelry, fashion collection, career and personal memorabilia.

==Legacy==
[[File:Gloria Swanson parking lot.jpg|thumb|The Gloria Swanson parking lot in downtown [[New Port Richey, Florida]] honors the star]]
Gloria Swanson has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]; one for motion pictures at 6748 Hollywood Boulevard, and another for television at 6301 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1955 and 1957, Swanson was awarded [http://www.eastmanhouse.org/museum/awards.php The George Eastman Award], given by [[George Eastman House]] for distinguished contribution to the art of film, and in 1966 the museum honored her with a career film retrospective, ''A Tribute to Gloria Swanson'', which screened several of her films between May 12-18.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dryden Theatre|first=|title=The Dryden Theatre of the George Eastman House Presents a Tribute to Gloria Swanson|year=1966|publisher=George Eastman House|location=Rochester, N.Y.|isbn=|pages=}}</ref> A parking lot by [[Sims Park]] in downtown [[New Port Richey]], Florida, is named after the star, who is said to have owned property along the [[Cotee River]].

In 1982, a year before her death, Swanson sold her archives of over 600 boxes for an undisclosed sum, including photographs, artwork, copies of films and private papers including correspondence, contracts and financial dealings to the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uthrc/00154/hrc-00154.html|title=An Inventory of Her Papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|work=University Texas Website}}</ref> The second-largest collection of Swanson materials is held in the family archives of Timothy A. Rooks. In the last years of her life Swanson professed a desire to see ''[[Beyond the Rocks (film)|Beyond the Rocks]]'', but the film was unavailable and considered [[lost film|lost]]. The film was rediscovered and screened in 2005.

Swanson was survived by both of her daughters (her son had died in 1975), several grandchildren, and great-grandchildren in the United States and France. As one of the greatest stars of early Hollywood, today Swanson is most remembered for her portrayal of Norma Desmond in 1950's ''Sunset Boulevard''.
