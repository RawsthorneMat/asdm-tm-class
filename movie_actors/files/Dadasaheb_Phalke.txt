==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Dhundiraj Govind Phalke was born in a [[deshastha]] Brahmin [[Marathi people|Marathi]] family  on 30 April 1870 at [[Tryambakeshwar]], 30&nbsp;km from [[Nashik]], Maharashtra, [[India]],<ref name=niff>[http://niffindia.com/phalke.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> where his father was an accomplished scholar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000430/spectrum/main2.htm#2 |title=The Sunday Tribune – Spectrum – Article |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref>

He joined [[Sir J. J. School of Art]], [[Mumbai]] in 1885. After passing from J.J. School in 1890, Phalke went to the Kala Bhavan in [[Baroda]], where he studied sculpture, engineering, drawing, painting and photography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/athena/ginsberg/2197/id61.htm |title=Dada Saheb Phalke – A Distinguished Student of Kalabhavan |publisher=Fortunecity.com |date=16 February 1944|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>

===Early career===
He began his career as a small town photographer in [[Godhra]] but had to leave business after the death of his first wife and child in an outbreak of the [[bubonic plague]]. He soon met the German magician [[Carl Hertz]], one of the 40 magicians employed by the [[Lumiere Brothers]].  Soon after, he had the opportunity to work with the [[Archeological Survey of India]] as a draftsman. However, restless with his job and its constraints, he turned to the business of printing. He specialised in [[lithography]] and [[oleograph]], and worked for painter [[Raja Ravi Varma]]. Phalke later started his own printing press, made his first trip abroad to Germany, to learn about the latest technology, machinery and for art also.

===Film===
[[Image:Raja Harishchandra.jpg|left|200px|thumb|''[[Raja Harischandra]]'' 1913, directed by Dadasaheb Phalke]]
Following a dispute with his partners about the running of the press, he gave up printing and turned his attention to moving pictures, after watching a silent film, ''The Life of Christ'' and envisioning Indian gods on the screen. Phalke made his first film, ''Raja Harishchandra'', in 1912; it was first shown publicly on 3 May 1913 at Mumbai's [[Coronation Cinema]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/249829/Raja-Harishchandra/overview |title=Raja-Harishchandra - Trailer - Cast - Showtimes - NYTimes.com |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref> effectively marking the beginning of the Indian film industry. Around one year before, Ramchandra Gopal (known as [[Dadasaheb Torne]]) had recorded on stage a film drama called ''Pundalik'' and shown recording at the same theatre. However, the credit for making the first indigenous Indian feature film is attributed to Dadasaheb Phalke<ref>{{cite web|author=Cybertech |url=http://www.nashik.com/halloffame/tribute/phalke.html |title=Hall of Fame : Tribute : Dadasaheb Phalke |publisher=Nashik.com |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> as it is said that "Pundalik" had British cinematographers.

Once again, Phalke proved successful in his new art and proceeded to make several silent films, shorts, documentary feature, educational, comic, tapping all the potential of this new medium. Film, having proved its financial viability, soon attracted businessmen who favoured money over aesthetics.

====Hindustan films====
Phalke formed a film company, Hindustan Films in partnership with five businessmen from [[Mumbai]], in the hope that by having the financial aspect of his profession handled by experts in the field, he would be free to pursue the creative aspect. He set up a model studio and trained technicians, actors but, very soon, he ran into insurmountable problems with his partners. In 1920, Phalke resigned from Hindustan Films, made his first announcement of retirement from cinema, and he wrote ''Rangbhoomi'' an acclaimed play. Lacking his extremely imaginative genius, Hindustan Films ran into deep financial loss, and he was finally persuaded to return. However, Phalke felt constrained by the business and, after directing a few films for the company, he withdrew it.

====Sound film====
The times changed and Phalke fell victim to the emerging technology of sound film. Unable to cope with the talkies, the man who had fathered the Indian film industry became obsolete. His last silent movie ''Setubandhan'' was released in 1932 and later released with dubbing. During 1936–38, he produced his last film ''Gangavataran'' (1937), before retiring to [[Nashik]], where he died on 16 February 1944.
