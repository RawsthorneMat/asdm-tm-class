'''John Augustus "Jack" Kelly Jr.''' (September 16, 1927 &ndash; November 7, 1992) simply known as '''Jack Kelly''', was an American film and television [[actor]] most noted for the role of "[[Maverick (TV series)#Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick|Bart Maverick]]" in the [[television series]] ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', which ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1957 to 1962.  Kelly shared the series, rotating as the lead from week to week, first with [[James Garner]] as [[Maverick (TV series)#James Garner as Bret Maverick|Bret Maverick]] (1957–1960) then with [[Roger Moore]] as [[Maverick (TV series)#Roger Moore as Beau Maverick|Beau Maverick]] (1960–1961) and [[Robert Colbert]] as [[Maverick (TV series)#Robert Colbert as Brent Maverick|Brent Maverick]] (1961; for two episodes), before becoming the only Maverick (alternating with reruns from the Garner era) in the [[List of Maverick episodes|fifth season]].

Kelly later became a politician, having served from 1983 to 1986 as the [[mayor]] of [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], [[California]].<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/09/obituaries/jack-kelly-an-actor-on-maverick-series-and-a-politician-65.html|title=Jack Kelly, an Actor On 'Maverick' Series And a Politician, 65 |date=November 9, 1992 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |accessdate=2009-11-30 }}</ref>

==Career==
Kelly made his film debut in an uncredited role in the 1939 [[biopic]] ''[[The Story of Alexander Graham Bell]]'', opposite [[Don Ameche]] and [[Loretta Young]]. On July 15, 1954, Kelly played the gunfighter, cattleman, and bandit [[Clay Allison]] in the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[Stories of the Century]]'', starring and narrated by [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0710945/|title=''Stories of the Century'': "Clay Allison"|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref>

In 1955-1956 television season, Kelly starred in a series based on the 1942 feature film ''[[Kings Row]]''. He played Dr. Parris Mitchell, a young [[psychiatrist]] coping with the narrow-minded environment of his small town. ''King's Row'' was one-third of the ''[[Warner Bros. Presents]]'' [[wheel series]], hosted by [[Gig Young]]. It rotated at the scheduled hour of 7:30 Eastern on Tuesday with a similar television version of the popular movie ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' as well as the new ABC Western series ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' starring [[Clint Walker]].

After the series ended in 1956, Kelly appeared in ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956) and ''She-Devil'' (1957), along with guest roles on ''[[Fireside Theater]]'', ''[[Schlitz Playhouse of Stars]]'', ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.

===''Maverick'' (1957–1962)===
[[File:Jack Kelly Richard Long Maverick 1960.JPG|left|thumb|With [[Richard Long (actor)|Richard Long]] as Gentleman Jack Darby (1960).]]
The various anti-heroic Mavericks were dapper professional poker-players roaming the [[Old West]] with the benefit of superb scripts.  The series had an enormous cultural impact during a time when there were only three television networks and most cities had only three TV channels to choose from.

''Maverick'''s demanding filming schedule had caused production to lag behind early on. The producers decided to give Bret Maverick ([[James Garner]]) a brother so as not to run out of episodes long before the end of the season. Thus, Kelly was introduced as Bart Maverick in "Hostage!", the [[List of Maverick episodes|eighth episode]] of the series. While he may not have matched Garner's popularity on ''Maverick'', Kelly did have his enthusiastic admirers. Possessing a deep voice, a [[John Barrymore]]-like profile and an easy-going screen presence, Kelly enjoyed an attentive following among female viewers of the series.  Series creator [[Roy Huggins]] was extremely critical of Kelly's acting in Huggins' [[Archive of American Television]] interview, noting that Kelly "dropped a funny line like a load of coal," but mentioned that he liked Kelly, who was more amusing than Garner "off camera."

Kelly shared the lead with James Garner in one of the show's most-discussed episodes, "[[Shady Deal at Sunny Acres]]", on which the first half of the 1973 movie ''[[The Sting]]'' appears to be based. The pair also co-starred in the famous "Pappy" episode in which Garner played the brothers' much-quoted father Beauregard "Pappy" Maverick, in addition to his regular role of Bret. Aided by trick photography, Bret and Pappy play cards together in one scene (Kelly had a dual role in the episode as well, playing Bart and elderly Uncle Bentley Maverick). Bart also rescued Bret at the climax of "[[Duel at Sundown (Maverick)|Duel at Sundown]]", in which Garner fist fought guest star [[Clint Eastwood]].  Since Garner enjoyed seniority on the series, he had first choice of which part he would play in the two-brother episodes, which delineated the brothers as "Maverick 1" and "Maverick 2" in the scripts, giving him an enormous advantage.  All but one script during the show's first two years were written with Garner in mind regardless of which actor would eventually be cast.  Roy Huggins insisted that the writers visualize Garner as Maverick while writing the scripts.  The sole exception to this edict during the first two seasons was "Passage to Fort Doom," written with Kelly in mind as a lark for the writers.

Although the "solo" episodes in which Bart appeared tended to be somewhat more dramatic than the Bret episodes, Kelly displayed his comedic skills in lighter ''Maverick'' outings such as "Hadley's Hunters" and "The People's Friend." Kelly actually appeared in more episodes of ''Maverick'' than James Garner, who left the show following a contract dispute in 1960. Kelly appeared in 83 episodes; Garner in only 65.  In the wake of Garner's departure, [[Roger Moore]] stepped in to play Bart's cousin [[List of Maverick episodes|Beau Maverick]] in fourteen episodes, sharing the screen with Kelly in three of them, while [[Robert Colbert]] appeared in two installments as a third brother named Brent, one of which briefly featured Kelly.

===Later career===
When ''Maverick'' ended in 1962, Kelly continued acting with roles in a number of films and television shows. In 1962, he played the lead in ''Red Nightmare'' (also known as ''[[The Commies Are Coming, the Commies Are Coming]]'' in its derisive 1985 video re-release incarnation) a [[Cold War]] film narrated by [[Jack Webb]] in which Kelly's character wakes up one morning to discover that America has been taken over by [[Communists]].

On December 30, 1963, Kelly appeared with [[Barbara Bain]] in "The Fenton Canaby Story" on ABC's ''[[Wagon Train]]''. Canaby is a former trailmaster with a dark secret he refuses to discuss. He is attracted to Lucy Garrison, a young woman with her own questionable past played by Barbara Bain, long before ''[[Mission: Impossible!]]''. [[Virginia Gregg]] plays Grace Lowe, who blames Canaby for her husband's death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0743116/|title=The Fenton Canaby Story|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref>

Kelly co-starred in ''[[Commandos (film)|Commandos]]'' (1968) opposite [[Lee Van Cleef]], and as a villain dressed almost exactly like Bart Maverick in ''[[Young Billy Young]]'' (1969) with [[Robert Mitchum]]. From 1969 to 1971, Kelly hosted the [[NBC]] daytime game show ''[[Sale of the Century]]'' but was eventually replaced by [[Joe Garagiola, Sr.|Joe Garagiola]]. He was also briefly a series regular in ''[[Get Christie Love!]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' (1978), and performed many lucrative television commercial [[voice-overs]].

In 1977 Kelly appeared as obstreperous villains for a few moments in two ''[[Rockford Files]]'' episodes starring James Garner. The first appearance was in the season 3 episode, "The Becker Connection," and the second was the first show of season 4, "Beamer's Last Case" as a jealous husband.  In 1978, he briefly appeared as Bart Maverick and was again paired with Garner in the TV-movie ''[[The New Maverick]]'' and in Garner's TV series ''[[Bret Maverick]]'' (1981; Kelly appeared momentarily at the end of the final episode of the show and would have become a regular had it been renewed). Kelly also showed up on a 1983 episode of ''[[The Fall Guy]]'', costumed as Maverick but basically playing himself in a storyline that rounded up many classic TV cowboys.

In 1991, he reprised the role of Bart Maverick one last time in the [[TV movie]] ''[[The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw]]'', a [[Kenny Rogers]] vehicle briefly featuring more than a dozen 1950s television series cowboys. Kelly's brief dialogue consisted almost exclusively of variations on the phrase, "you can't have a real poker game without a Maverick."

==Business and politics==
Kelly's acting roles became less frequent in the late 1970s as he became more involved in [[real estate]] and local politics.  He started buying real estate in Huntington Beach in the mid 1960s and moved there permanently in 1971.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holderman, Jerry; and Janet Eastman |title=Rich man, poor man, beggar man... |journal=[[Orange Coast Magazine]] |publisher=Emmis Communications |date=January 1981 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=148 |issn=0279-0483 }}</ref>
