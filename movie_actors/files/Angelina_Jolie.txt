She has received an [[Academy Award]], two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and three [[Golden Globe Awards]], and has been cited as Hollywood's highest-paid actress. Jolie made her screen debut as a child alongside her father, [[Jon Voight]], in ''[[Lookin' to Get Out]]'' (1982). Her film career began in earnest a decade later with the low-budget production ''[[Cyborg 2]]'' (1993), followed by her first leading role in a major film, ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'' (1995). She starred in the critically acclaimed biographical television films ''[[George Wallace (film)|George Wallace]]'' (1997) and ''[[Gia]]'' (1998), and won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance in the drama ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' (1999).

Jolie's starring role as the video game heroine [[Lara Croft]] in ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' (2001) established her as a leading Hollywood actress. She continued her successful action-star career with ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'' (2005), ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'' (2008), and ''[[Salt (2010 film)|Salt]]'' (2010), and received critical acclaim for her performances in the dramas ''[[A Mighty Heart (film)|A Mighty Heart]]'' (2007) and ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'' (2008), which earned her a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Beginning in the 2010s, she expanded her career by directing and producing the wartime dramas ''[[In the Land of Blood and Honey]]'' (2011) and ''[[Unbroken (film)|Unbroken]]'' (2014). Her biggest commercial success came with the [[Disney]] fantasy ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'' (2014).

In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]] and an honorary damehood of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]] (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a [[Diplomatic rank#Special envoys|Special Envoy]] for the [[UNHCR|United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry, as well as the world's most beautiful woman, by various media outlets. Her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actors [[Jonny Lee Miller]] and [[Billy Bob Thornton]], she is now married to actor [[Brad Pitt]].

==Career==

===1991–97: Early work===
Jolie committed to acting professionally at the age of 16, but initially found it difficult to pass auditions, often being told that her demeanor was "too dark."<ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/> She appeared in five of her brother's student films, made while he attended the [[USC School of Cinema-Television]], as well as in several music videos, namely [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s "Stand by My Woman" (1991), [[Antonello Venditti]]'s "Alta Marea" (1991), [[The Lemonheads]]'s "It's About Time" (1993), and [[Meat Loaf]]'s "[[Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through]]" (1993). She began to learn from her father, as she noticed his method of observing people to become like them. Their relationship during this time was less strained, with Jolie realizing that they were both "drama queens."<ref name="Angelina Jolie Biography"/>

Jolie began her professional film career in 1993, when she played her first leading role in the straight-to-video science-fiction sequel ''[[Cyborg 2]]'', as a near-human robot designed for corporate espionage and assassination. She was so disappointed with the film that she did not audition again for a year.<ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/> Following a supporting role in the independent film ''[[Without Evidence]]'' (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, ''[[Hackers (film)|Hackers]]'' (1995). ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, "Kate stands out. That's because she scowls even more sourly than [her co-stars] and is that rare female hacker who sits intently at her keyboard in a see-through top."<ref>{{cite news | last=Maslin | first=Janet | url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE2D61631F936A2575AC0A963958260 | title=Those Wacky Teenagers and Their Crazy Fads | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 15, 1995 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> ''Hackers'' failed to make a profit at the box office, but developed a cult following after its video release.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Brandt | first=Andrew | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/04/05/hacking.hollywood.idg/index.html?related | title=How Hollywood portrays hackers | journal=PC World | date=May 4, 2001 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060510124043/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/04/05/hacking.hollywood.idg/index.html?related | archivedate=May 10, 2006 | deadurl=yes}}</ref>

After starring in the modern-day ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' adaptation ''[[Love Is All There Is]]'' (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie ''[[Mojave Moon]]'' (1996), of which ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, "Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair and the kind of blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that [[Danny Aiello]]'s character would drop everything just for the chance of being with her."<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0184646/ | title=Film review: 'Mojave Moon' | journal=The Hollywood Reporter | date=November 24, 1996 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> In ''[[Foxfire (1996 film)|Foxfire]]'' (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote of her performance, "It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst."<ref>{{cite news | last=Mathews | first=Jack | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-23/entertainment/ca-36764_1_drifter | title=Rebellion in 'Foxfire' Loses Impact in Leap to the '90s | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=August 23, 1996 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref>

In 1997, Jolie starred with [[David Duchovny]] in the thriller ''[[Playing God (film)|Playing God]]'', set in the Los Angeles underworld. The film was not well received by critics; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted that Jolie "finds a certain warmth in a kind of role that is usually hard and aggressive; she seems too nice to be [a mobster's] girlfriend, and maybe she is."<ref>{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19971017/REVIEWS/710170306/1023 | title=Reviews: Playing God | newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times | date=October 17, 1997 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> Her next work, as a frontierswoman in the [[CBS]] miniseries ''[[True Women]]'' (1997), was even less successful; writing for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', Robert Strauss dismissed her as "horrid, a fourth-rate [[Scarlett O'Hara]]" who relies on "gnashed teeth and overly pouted lips."<ref>{{cite news | last=Strauss | first=Robert | url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-05-16/entertainment/25564646_1_janice-woods-windle-true-women-annabeth-gish | newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer | title='True Women' Cooks Up a Tale of Suffering With No Nutritional Value | date=May 16, 1997 | accessdate=January 28, 2015}}</ref> Jolie also starred in the music video for the [[Rolling Stones]]'s "[[Anybody Seen My Baby?]]" as a stripper who leaves mid-performance to wander New York City.

===1998–2000: Breakthrough===
Jolie's career prospects began to improve after she won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award]] for her performance in [[TNT (TV channel)|TNT]]'s ''[[George Wallace (film)|George Wallace]]'' (1997), about the life of the segregationist Alabama Governor and presidential candidate [[George Wallace]], played by [[Gary Sinise]]. Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, [[Cornelia Wallace|Cornelia]], a performance Lee Winfrey of ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' considered a highlight of the film.<ref>{{cite news | last=Winfrey | first=Lee | url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-08-24/entertainment/25569021_1_george-wallace-arthur-bremer-alabama-gov | title= A Story Of Civil Wrongs And Eventual Repentance | newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer | date=August 24, 1997 | accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref> ''George Wallace'' was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film]]. Jolie also received a nomination for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie|Emmy Award]] for her performance.

Jolie's first breakthrough came when she portrayed supermodel [[Gia Carangi]] in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Gia]]'' (1998). The film chronicles the destruction of Carangi's life and career as a result of her addiction to heroin, and her decline and death from AIDS in the mid-1980s. Vanessa Vance of Reel.com retrospectively noted, "Jolie gained wide recognition for her role as the titular Gia, and it's easy to see why. Jolie is fierce in her portrayal—filling the part with nerve, charm, and desperation—and her role in this film is quite possibly the most beautiful train wreck ever filmed."<ref>{{cite web | last=Vance | first=Vanessa | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090611143609/http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=42045&PID=10086013&Tab=reviews&CID=18 | title=Gia (1998) | publisher=Reel.com |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20021114033537/http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=42045&PID=10086013&Tab=reviews&CID=18 |archivedate=November 14, 2002 | deadurl=yes}}</ref> For the second consecutive year, Jolie won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film|Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie|Emmy Award]]. She also won her first [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie|Screen Actors Guild Award]].

In accordance with [[Lee Strasberg]]'s [[method acting]], Jolie preferred to stay in character in between scenes during many of her early films, and as a result had gained a reputation for being difficult to deal with. While shooting ''Gia'', she told her husband, [[Jonny Lee Miller]], that she would not be able to phone him: "I'd tell him: 'I'm alone; I'm dying; I'm gay; I'm not going to see you for weeks.'"<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://angelanna3.tripod.com/interviews2000/id12.html | title=Star Light, Star Bright – Hollywood's shining starlets | journal=Pavement | date=February–March 2000 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> After ''Gia'' [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]], she briefly gave up acting, because she felt that she had "nothing else to give."<ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/> She separated from Miller and moved to New York, where she took night classes at [[New York University]] to study directing and screenwriting.<ref name="Angelina Jolie: Body Beautiful"/> Encouraged by her Golden Globe Award win for ''George Wallace'' and the positive critical reception of ''Gia'', Jolie resumed her career.<ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/>

Following the previously filmed gangster film ''[[Hell's Kitchen (1998 film)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' (1998), Jolie returned to the screen in ''[[Playing by Heart]]'' (1998), part of an ensemble cast that included [[Sean Connery]], [[Gillian Anderson]], and [[Ryan Phillippe]].

In 1999, Jolie starred in the comedy-drama ''[[Pushing Tin]]'', alongside [[John Cusack]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], and [[Cate Blanchett]]. The film met with mixed reception from critics, and Jolie's character—Thornton's seductive wife—was particularly criticized; writing for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Desson Howe]] dismissed her as "a completely ludicrous writer's creation of a free-spirited woman who weeps over hibiscus plants that die, wears lots of turquoise rings and gets real lonely when Russell spends entire nights away from home."<ref>{{cite news | last=Howe | first=Desson | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/movies/reviews/pushingtinhowe.htm | title='Pushing Tin': A Bumpy Ride | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=April 23, 1999 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> Jolie then co-starred with [[Denzel Washington]] in ''[[The Bone Collector]]'' (1999), playing a police officer who reluctantly helps Washington's [[paraplegic]] detective track down a serial killer.

Jolie next took the supporting role of a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] mental patient in ''[[Girl, Interrupted (film)|Girl, Interrupted]]'' (1999), an adaptation of [[Susanna Kaysen]]'s [[Girl, Interrupted|memoir of the same name]]. While [[Winona Ryder]] played the main character in what was hoped to be a comeback for her, the film instead marked Jolie's final breakthrough in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.imdb.com/MotDArchive/2003/motd.20030307 | title=IMDb Movie of the Day | publisher=IMDb | date=March 7, 2003 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20031222154652/http://www.imdb.com/MotDArchive/2003/motd.20030307 |archivedate=December 22, 2003 | deadurl=yes}}</ref> She won her third [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award]], her second [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role|Screen Actors Guild Award]], and an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]].

===2001–04: International success===
Although highly regarded for her acting abilities, Jolie had rarely found films that appealed to a wide audience, but ''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'' (2001) made her an international superstar. An adaptation of the popular ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' videogames, the film required her to learn an English accent and undergo extensive martial arts training to play the archaeologist-adventurer [[Lara Croft]]. Although the film generated mostly negative reviews, Jolie was generally praised for her physical performance; ''[[Newsday]]''{{'}}s John Anderson commented, "Jolie makes the title character a virtual icon of female competence and coolth."<ref>{{cite journal | last=Anderson | first=John | url=http://www.newsday.com/content/movies/nd9040.htm | journal=Newsday | title=It's No Game: She's a Woman of Action | date=June 15, 2001 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010625111019/http://www.newsday.com/content/movies/nd9040.htm |archivedate=June 25, 2001 | deadurl=yes}}</ref> The film was an international hit, earning $274.7 million worldwide,<ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results"/> and launched her global reputation as a female action star.

Jolie next starred opposite [[Antonio Banderas]] as his mail-order bride in ''[[Original Sin (2001 film)|Original Sin]]'' (2001), the first of a string of films that were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. ''The New York Times'' critic [[Elvis Mitchell]] questioned Jolie's decision to follow her Oscar-winning performance with "soft-core nonsense."<ref>{{cite news | last=Mitchell | first=Elvis | url= http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE1D9143CF930A3575BC0A9679C8B63 | title=Original Sin: The Item You Ordered May Be Sneaky | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 3, 2001 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> The romantic comedy ''[[Life or Something Like It]]'' (2002), though equally unsuccessful, marked an unusual choice for Jolie.

Jolie reprised her role as Lara Croft in ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life]]'' (2003), which was not as lucrative as the original, earning $156.5 million at the international box office.<ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results"/> She also starred in the music video for [[Korn]]'s "[[Did My Time]]", which was used to promote the sequel.

The year 2004 saw the release of four films featuring Jolie. She first starred in the thriller ''[[Taking Lives]]'' as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; ''The Hollywood Reporter'' critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, "Jolie plays a role that definitely feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour."<ref>{{cite journal | last=Honeycutt | first=Kirk | url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000462115 | title=Taking Lives | journal=The Hollywood Reporter | date=March 15, 2004 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071011080057/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000462115 | archivedate=December 29, 2014 | deadurl=yes}}</ref> Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'', a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors in front of a [[Chroma key|bluescreen]], and voiced her first family film, the [[DreamWorks]] animation ''[[Shark Tale]]''.

===2005–10===
In 2005, Jolie finally returned to major box office success with the action-comedy ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'', in which she starred opposite [[Brad Pitt]] as a bored married couple who find out that they are both secret assassins. The film received mixed reviews, but was generally lauded for the chemistry between the two leads; ''[[Star Tribune]]'' critic Colin Covert noted, "While the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry."<ref>{{cite news | last=Covert |first=Colin | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mr_and_mrs_smith/reviews/?type=top_critics |title=Mr. & Mrs. Smith | newspaper=Minneapolis Star Tribune | date=June 9, 2005 | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref> With box office takings of $478.2 million worldwide, ''Mr. & Mrs. Smith'' was the seventh-highest grossing picture of the year and remained Jolie's highest-grossing live-action film for the next decade.<ref name="Angelina Jolie Movie Box Office Results"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&yr=2005&p=.htm | title=2005 Worldwide Grosses | publisher=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==

===Relationships and marriages===
Jolie had a serious boyfriend for two years from the age of 14. Her mother allowed them to live together in her home, of which Jolie later said, "I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or he was going to be with me in my bedroom with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way."<ref>{{cite journal | last=Kasle Furmaniak | first=Jennifer | url= http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/news/a1570/angelina-jolie-03/ | title=Angelina Holds Nothing Back | journal=Cosmopolitan | date=August 2003 | accessdate=January 9, 2015 }}</ref> She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.<ref>{{cite news | last=Hobson | first=Louis B. | url=http://www.jonnyleemiller.co.uk/angelinajolie.html | title=Jolie's rocky relationships | newspaper=Calgary Sun | year=2000 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}</ref>

During filming of ''Hackers'' (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the relationship in her early teens.<ref name="Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic"/> They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after on March 28, 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name in her blood.<ref>{{cite news | last=Bandon | first=Alexandra | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E7DF1230F936A1575BC0A960958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | title=Following, Ambivalently, in Mom or Dad's Footsteps | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 25, 1996 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}</ref> Jolie and Miller separated in September 1997 and divorced on February 3, 1999. They remained on good terms, and Jolie later explained, "It comes down to timing. I think he's the greatest husband a girl could ask for. I'll always love him, we were simply too young."<ref>{{cite journal | url= http://www.jonnyleemiller.co.uk/angelinajolie.html | title=Interview with Angelina Jolie | journal=B Magazine | date=February 2004 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}</ref>

Jolie began a relationship with model-actress [[Jenny Shimizu]] on the set of ''Foxfire'' (1996). She later said, "I would probably have married Jenny if I hadn't married my husband. I fell in love with her the first second I saw her."<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://angelanna3.tripod.com/interviews/id4.html | title=Tis the Season to Be Jolie | journal=Girlfriends | date=December 1997 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}</ref> According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted many years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people, though it had ended by 2005.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Czyzselska | first= Jane | url=http://www.divamag.co.uk/category/arts-entertainment/jenny-shimizu-rebecca-loos-what%27s-the-story.aspx | title=Jenny Shimizu and Rebecca Loos: what's the story? |journal=Diva | date=November 2005 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}</ref> In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, "Of course.

After a two-month courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They met on the set of ''Pushing Tin'' (1999), but did not pursue a relationship at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress [[Laura Dern]], while Jolie was reportedly dating actor [[Timothy Hutton]], her co-star in ''Playing God'' (1997).<ref>{{cite journal | last=Dam | first=Julie K.L. | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20131307,00.html | title=Early to Wed | journal=People | date=May 22, 2000 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}</ref> As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0056657/ | title=Thornton Still Has Angelina Blood Locket | publisher=WENN | date=April 21, 2004 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}</ref> Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later.<ref name="Marriage, Interrupted">{{cite journal | last=Smolowee | first=Jill | url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20137667,00.html | title=Marriage, Interrupted | journal=People | date=August 5, 2002 | accessdate=January 11, 2015}}</ref> Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet."<ref name="Learning To Fly"/>
 
In early 2005, Jolie was involved in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of being the reason for the divorce of actors Brad Pitt and [[Jennifer Aniston]]. She and Pitt were alleged to have started an affair during filming of ''Mr. & Mrs. Smith'' (2005). Jolie stated on several occasions that this was not true, but later said that they "fell in love" on the set.<ref>{{cite news| last=Harris | first=Mark | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/movies/19harr.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all | title=The Mommy Track | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 15, 2008 | accessdate=January 9, 2015}}</ref> She explained in 2005, "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive.

Professionally, Jolie's status as a sex symbol has been considered both an asset and a hindrance. Some of her most commercially successful films, including ''Lara Croft: Tomb Raider'' (2001) and ''Beowulf'' (2007), overtly relied at least in part on her sex appeal,<ref>{{cite journal | last=Seiler | first=Andy | last2=Snider | first2=Mike | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-06-15-lara-croft.htm | journal=USA Today | title=Lara Croft's greatest leap | date=June 15, 2001 | accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vulture.com/2007/11/sure_beowulf_is_a_technologica.html | title=Yes, 'Beowulf' Is a Technological Marvel — But How Does Angelina Jolie Look Naked? | website=Vulture | date=November 16, 2007 | accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref> with ''Empire'' stating that her "pneumatic figure," "feline eyes," and "bee-stung lips" have greatly contributed to her appeal to cinema audiences.<ref name="Empire sexiest">{{cite web | url= http://www.empireonline.com/100sexiest/default.asp?star=1 | title=Angelina Jolie 'Sexiest Movie Star Ever' | journal=Empire | date=December 5, 2007 | accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> Conversely, ''Salon'' writer Allen Barra agreed with critics who suggested that Jolie's "dark and intense sexuality" has limited her in the types of roles she can be cast in, rendering her unconvincing in many conventional women's roles,<ref name="Salon"/> while Clint Eastwood, who directed her Oscar-nominated performance in ''Changeling'' (2008), opined that having "the most beautiful face on the planet" sometimes harmed her dramatic credibility with audiences.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/film/beautiful-face-hampers-jolie-eastwood/2008/10/06/1223145233452.html | newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Australian Associated Press | title= Beautiful face hampers Jolie: Eastwood |date=October 6, 2008 | accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>

Beyond her career, Jolie's appearance has been credited with influencing popular culture at large. In 2002, [[AfterEllen]] founder [[Sarah Warn]] observed that many women of all sexual orientations had publicly expressed their attraction to Jolie, which she considered a new development in American culture, adding that "there are many beautiful women in Hollywood, and few generate the same kind of overwhelming interest across genders and sexual orientations that she does."<ref>{{cite web | last=Warn | first=Sarah | url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/4213-the-angelina-jolie-phenomenon | title=The Angelina Jolie Phenomenon | publisher=AfterEllen | date=July 1, 2002 | accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> Jolie's physical attributes became highly sought-after among western women seeking cosmetic surgery; by 2007, she was considered "the gold standard of beauty,"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/beauty/jolie-good/2007/04/12/1175971251818.html | title=Everyone wants to look like Jolie | newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Australian Associated Press | date=April 12, 2007 | accessdate=January 27, 2015}}</ref> with her full lips remaining the most imitated celebrity feature well into the 2010s.<ref>{{cite news | last=Landman | first=Beth | url=http://nypost.com/2013/04/23/nycs-most-wanted-face/ | title=NYC's most wanted face | newspaper=New York Post | date=April 23, 2013 | accessdate=January 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Douglas | first=Joanna | url=https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/everyone-wants-angelina-jolies-lips-kim-109212427563.html | title= Everyone Wants Angelina Jolie's Lips, Kim Kardashian's Eyes, and Brad Pitt's Nose | publisher=Yahoo!
