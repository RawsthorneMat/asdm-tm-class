'''Fernando Casado Arambillet''' (20 September 1917&nbsp;&ndash; 9 March 1994), best known as '''Fernando Rey''', was a Spanish film, theatre, and TV actor, who worked in both Europe and the United States. A suave, international actor best known for his roles in the films of surrealist director [[Luis Buñuel]] (''[[Tristana]]'', 1970; ''[[The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie|Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie]]'', 1972; ''[[That Obscure Object of Desire]]'', 1977) and as a [[drug lord]] in ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), he appeared in more than 150 films over half a century.

The debonair Rey was described by ''French Connection'' producer [[Philip D'Antoni]] as "the last of the Continental guys". He achieved his greatest notoriety after he turned 50: "Perhaps it is a pity that my success came so late in life", he told ''[[The Times (disambiguation)|The Times]]'' of [[Madrid]] in 1973. "It might have been better to have been successful while young, like [[El Cordobés]] in the [[bullring]]. Then your life is all before you to enjoy it."

==Biography==

===The beginnings===
Rey was born in [[A Coruña]], Spain, the son of Captain Casado Veiga. He studied [[architecture]], but the [[Spanish Civil War]] interrupted his university studies which led him to his success.

In 1936, Rey began his career in movies as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]], sometimes even getting credited. It was then that he chose his [[stage name]], Fernando Rey. He kept his first name, but took his mother's second surname, Rey, a short surname with a clear meaning ("Rey" is Spanish for "King").

In 1944, his first speaking role was the [[List of Dukes of Alba|Duke of Alba]] in [[José López Rubio]]'s ''Eugenia de Montijo''. Four years later, he acted the part of [[Philip I of Castile|Felipe I el Hermoso]], King of Spain, in the Spanish cinema blockbuster ''[[Locura de amor]]''.

This was the start of a prolific career in movies (he played in around two hundred films), radio, theater, and television. Rey was also a great [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing actor]] in Spanish television. His voice was considered intense and personal, and he became the narrator of important Spanish movies like [[Luis García Berlanga]]'s ''[[Welcome Mr. Marshall!|Bienvenido Mr. Marshall]]'' (1953), [[Ladislao Vajda]]'s ''[[Marcelino Pan y Vino]]'' (1955), and even the 1992 re-dubbed version of [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]''. In fact, Rey acted in four different film versions of ''Don Quixote'' in different roles, if one counts the Welles version (for which Rey supplied offscreen narration in the final scene).

His brilliant performance in the role of a demotivated and doubtful actor in [[Juan Antonio Bardem]]'s ''[[Comedians (film)|Cómicos]]'' (1954), while showing him for the first time in a successful lead part, paradoxically, as he saw himself as the real incarnation of the role, plunged him in a professional depression, of which he did not emerge until his collaboration with [[Luis Buñuel]] several years later. However, in the short term, Buñuel's disconcerting public remark on Rey's performance in other Bardem's film, ''Sonatas'' (1959), "I love how this actor plays a corpse", could only increase Rey's apprehensions.  Nevertheless, Rey became eventually Buñuel's preferred actor and closest friend.

===International career===
Rey's first international performance was in ''[[The Night Heaven Fell]]'' (''Les bijoutiers du clair de lune'') a 1958 French-Italian film directed by [[Roger Vadim]], where he acted alongside [[Stephen Boyd]], [[Marina Vlady]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]]. Previously he had played in an American TV series, ''It happens in Spain'', the story of the exploits of a private detective, operating out in Spain, who helps distressed American tourists.

In 1959, Rey co-starred with [[Steve Reeves]] and [[Christine Kaufmann]] in the Italian [[sword and sandal]] film ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1959 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]''.

In 1961 Rey played in a European Western, ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'', and as the popularity of that genre increased during that decade appeared in some other movies, including the political ''[[The Price of Power]]'' (1969), the bizarre cult classic ''[[Companeros]]'', and two sequels of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', namely ''[[Return of the Seven]]'' (1966) and ''[[Guns of the Magnificent Seven]]'' (1969).

It was his work with Orson Welles and [[Luis Buñuel]] during the 1960s and 1970s that made Rey internationally prominent; becoming indeed the first 'international Spanish actor'. Rey starred in Buñuel's ''[[Viridiana]]'' (1961), ''[[Tristana]]'' (1970), ''[[The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie]]'' (''Le charme discret de la bourgeoisie)'' (1972) (a [[surrealism|surreal]] movie which received the 1972 [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]) and ''[[That Obscure Object of Desire]]'' (1977). For Welles, Rey performed in two completed films, ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'' (1966) and ''[[The Immortal Story]]'' (1968).

Rey played memorably the French villain Alain Charnier in [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971). Initially, Friedkin intended to cast [[Francisco Rabal]] as Charnier, but could not remember his name after seeing him in [[Luis Buñuel]]'s ''[[Belle de Jour (film)|Belle de jour]]''; he only knew the person he had in mind was a Spanish actor who had worked with Buñuel. Rey was hired after he flew to New York to be met by a surprised Friedkin. Rey's English and French were not perfect, but Friedkin discovered that Rabal spoke neither of them,<ref>{{cite web|title=William Friedkin on Casting Fernando Rey|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk19-bKO2IA|website=YouTube|publisher=AFISilverTheatre's channel|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> and opted to keep Rey, who reprised the role in the less successful sequel, ''[[French Connection II]]'' (1975).

Along 1970s and 80s Rey played in many international co-productions of the most heterogeneous [[film genres]], some of his appearances being almost just [[Cameo appearance|cameos]]. Among them, to name only a few, [[Lewis Gilbert]]'s ''[[The Adventurers (1970 film)|The Adventurers]]'' (1970), [[Mauro Bolognini]]'s ''[[Drama of the Rich]]'' (1974), [[Vincente Minnelli]]'s ''[[A Matter of Time (film)|A Matter of Time]]'' (1976), [[Valerio Zurlini]]'s ''[[The Desert of the Tartars]]'' (1976), [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[Quintet (film)|Quintet]]'' (1979), [[J. Lee Thompson]]'s ''[[Caboblanco]]'' (1980) and [[Frank Perry]]'s ''[[Monsignor (film)|Monsignor]]'' (1982). But Rey's great success in those years indisputably was ''[[Elisa, vida mía]]'', a 1977 Spanish drama film written and directed by [[Carlos Saura]].

On his work in [[Stuart Rosenberg]]'s ''[[Voyage of the Damned]]'' (1976), Rey once said: "I played [Cuban] president [[Federico Laredo Brú|Brú]]; a cameo. They paid me a lot of money for less than six hours of shooting, in the [[Barcelona]] Stock Exchange building, with [[James Mason]]. I got more money than Orson Welles, who played a great role ...".<ref>Cebollada, Pascual, ''Fernando Rey'', Madrid 1992 p.&nbsp;299.</ref>

===Back in Spain===
In later years Rey preferred to work in Spain, with successes as Francisco Regueiro's ''[[Padre nuestro (1985 film)|Padre Nuestro]]'' (1985), [[José Luis Cuerda]]'s ''El bosque animado'' (1987) or [[Jaime de Armiñán]]'s ''Al otro lado del túnel'' (1992), and above all his incarnation of [[Don Quixote]], alongside [[Alfredo Landa]] as [[Sancho Panza]], in the memorable [[Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón]]'s ''El Quijote de Miguel de Cervantes'' (1991) for the [[Televisión Española|Spanish National TV]].

His last appearance on the screen was in a supporting role in the Spanish [[black comedy]] ''El cianuro ... ¿sólo o con leche?'' (''Cyanide ... pure or with milk?'') (1994).

===Recognition and awards===
In 1971 Fernando Rey won the best actor award in the [[San Sebastián International Film Festival]], for his performance in [[Rafael Gil]]'s ''La duda'', based, like ''Viridiana'' and ''Tristana'', on a novel by [[Benito Pérez Galdós]].

Another of the successes of Rey-Buñuel's collaboration was ''[[That Obscure Object of Desire]]'' (1977), nominated for another Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe in the same category, though the movie failed to win either. Rey's voice had to be dubbed by [[Michel Piccoli]].

In [[Lina Wertmüller]]'s [[Academy Award]]-nominated film, ''[[Seven Beauties]]'' (1975), Rey played the role of Pedro the [[anarchist]] who, as a friend of the protagonist and fellow prisoner Pasqualino Settebellezze, chooses a gruesome suicide rather than spend another day in a [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]].

Rey won [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]] award at 1977 [[Cannes Film Festival]] for his performance in ''Elisa, vida mía''.

In 1988 he again won the best actor award in the San Sebastián International Film Festival, this time for his performance in two films:  Francisco Regueiro's ''Diario de invierno'' and [[Antonio Isasi-Isasmendi]]'s ''El Aire de un Crimen (The Hint of a Crime)''.

Fernando Rey was also awarded the gold medal of the Spanish Movie Arts and Sciences Academy.

==Personal life and death==
In 1960, Rey married the [[Argentina|Argentine]] actress Mabel Karr. In 1992 he became chairman of the [[Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematográficas de España|Spanish Movie Arts and Sciences Academy]]. He died of [[cancer]] in [[Madrid]] in 1994.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19940310&id=urgyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KRUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3049,3520851 Fernando Rey dies of cancer]</ref>
