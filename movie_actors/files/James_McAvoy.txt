==Career==

===Early career===
McAvoy's acting debut came at the age of 15 in ''The Near Room'' (1995). He later admitted that he was not very interested in acting when joining the movie, but was inspired to study the craft after developing feelings for his co-star, Alana Brady.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/celebrity/news/a212558/james-mcavoy-inspired-by-teenage-crush.html |first=Hugh |last=Armitage |title=James McAvoy inspired by teenage crush |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=5 April 2010 |accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref> He continued to act while still a member of [[PACE Youth Theatre]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pacetheatre.co.uk/youththeatre/pastmembers.asp |title=Former Members |publisher=[[PACE Youth Theatre]] |accessdate=2 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref> McAvoy eventually graduated from the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] in 2000.<ref name="latimes07"/> Throughout the early 2000s, he made guest appearances in television shows and began working on movies. In 2001, McAvoy's performance as a gay [[hustler]] in the play ''Out in the Open'' impressed director [[Joe Wright]] so much that Wright began offering McAvoy parts in his films. McAvoy kept declining them, however, and it wasn't until six years later that the two actually worked together.<ref name="latimes07">{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/02/entertainment/ca-mcavoy2 |first=Mark |last=Salisbury |title=Ready for the next step |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=2 December 2007 |accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref>

===''Wanted'' and subsequent work===
One of the biggest highlights of McAvoy's career was starring with [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Morgan Freeman]] in ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'', an action film where he portrayed Wesley Gibson, a young American slacker who learns he is heir to a legacy of assassins. When McAvoy screen-tested for the role, he was initially rejected because the studio was seeking an actor with conventional Hollywood leading-man looks and physique. He later recalled being considered the "runt of the litter" of those who tested, but ultimately got the role in late 2006 since the studio "wanted someone geeky".<ref name="chat">{{cite web |first=Edward |last=Douglas |url=http://comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=18933
