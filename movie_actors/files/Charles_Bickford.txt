==Biography==

===Early life===
Bickford was born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], during the first minute of 1891.<ref>Bickford, Charles.  ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.  Paul S. Eriksson, Inc., 1965, p. 4</ref> The fifth of seven children, Charles was an intelligent but very independent and unruly child. He had a particularly strong relationship with his maternal grandfather (a sea captain) who was a powerful influence during his formative years. At the age of nine he was tried and acquitted of the attempted murder of a trolley motorman who had callously driven over and killed his beloved dog.<ref>Bickford, Charles.  ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.  Paul S. Eriksson, Inc., 1965, pp. 12-16</ref> Always more interested in experiencing life than reading about it, Charles was generally considered "the wild rogue" of this family, causing his parents frequent consternation.  In his late teens he drifted aimlessly around the United States for a time. Before breaking into acting he worked as a lumberjack, investment promoter, and for a short time, ran a pest extermination business. He was a stoker and fireman in the United States Navy when a friend dared him to get a job in [[Burlesque]]. His first entry into acting was on the stage, eventually including Broadway.  This venue provided him with an occasional living and served as the principal training ground for developing his acting and vocal talents.

===Acting career===
Bickford had intended to attend the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to earn an engineering degree, but while wandering around the country, he became friends with the manager of a burlesque show, who convinced Bickford to take a role in the show.  He debuted in [[Oakland, California]] in 1911.<ref>Bickford, Charles.  ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.  Paul S. Eriksson, Inc., 1965, pp. 50-53.</ref>  Bickford enjoyed himself so much that he abandoned his plans to attend M.I.T.<ref>Bickford, Charles.  ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.  Paul S. Eriksson, Inc., 1965, pp. 60-61.</ref>  He made his legitimate stage debut with the John Craig Stock Company at the [[Castle Square Theatre]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in 1912.<ref>Bickford, Charles.  ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.  Paul S. Eriksson, Inc., 1965, pp. 61-62.</ref>  He eventually joined a road company and traveled throughout the United States for more than a decade, appearing in various productions.  In 1925, while working in a Broadway play called ''Outside Looking In'', he and co-star [[James Cagney]] (in his first Broadway role) received rave reviews.<ref>Bickford, Charles.  ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.  Paul S. Eriksson, Inc., 1965, pp. 142-145</ref>  He was offered a role in [[Herbert Brenon]]'s 1926 film of ''[[Beau Geste]]'', but anxious not to give up his newfound Broadway stardom, turned it down, a decision he later came to regret.  Following his appearance in the critically praised but unsuccessful [[Maxwell Anderson]]-Harold Hickerson drama about the [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] case, ''Gods of the Lightning'' (Bickford was the Sacco character), Bickford was contacted by filmmaker [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and offered a contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] studios to star in DeMille's first talking picture, ''[[Dynamite (film)|Dynamite]]''.<ref>Bickford, Charles.  ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.  Paul S. Eriksson, Inc., 1965, p. 157</ref> He soon began working with MGM head [[Louis B. Mayer]] on a number of projects.

He soon became a star after playing [[Greta Garbo]]'s lover in ''[[Anna Christie (1930 film)|Anna Christie]]'' (1930), but never developed into a leading man. Always of independent mind, exceptionally strong-willed and quick with his fists, Bickford would frequently argue and nearly come to blows with Mayer and any number of other MGM authority figures during the course of this contract with the studio. During the production of DeMille's ''[[Dynamite (film)|Dynamite]]'', he punched out his director following a string of heated arguments primarily, but not exclusively, related to the interpretation of his character's role. Throughout his early career on both the stage and later films Bickford rejected numerous scripts and made no secret of his disdain for much of the material he was offered.  Not surprisingly, his association with MGM was short-lived with Bickford asking for and quickly receiving a release from his contract.  However, he soon found himself blacklisted at other studios forcing him <ref>Bickford, Charles.  ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.  Paul S. Eriksson, Inc., 1965, pp. 274-277</ref>  to take the highly unusual step (for that era) of  becoming an independent actor for several years.  His career took another turn when in 1935 he was mauled by a lion and nearly killed while filming ''East of Java.''  While he recovered, he lost his contract with Fox as well as his leading man status due to extensive neck scarring suffered in the attack coupled with his advancing age.<ref>Bickford, Charles.  ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.  Paul S. Eriksson, Inc., 1965, pp. 298-303</ref>  It was not long however before he made a very successful transition to character roles which he felt offered much greater diversity and allowed him to showcase his talent to better effect.  Much preferring the character roles that now became his forte, Bickford appeared in many notable films including ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (1947 film)|The Farmer's Daughter]]'', ''[[Johnny Belinda (1948 film)|Johnny Belinda]]'', ''[[A Star is Born (1954 film)|A Star is Born]]'', and ''[[Not As a Stranger]]''.<ref>Bickford, Charles.  ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.  Paul S. Eriksson, Inc., 1965, p 308.</ref>
  
Finding great success playing an array of character roles in films and later in television, Bickford quickly became highly sought after; his burly frame and craggy, intense features, coupled with a gruff, powerful voice lent themselves to a wide variety of roles. Most often he played lovable father figures, stern businessmen, heavies, ship captains or authority figures of some sort. During the 1940s, he was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He served as host of the 1950s television series ''[[The Man Behind the Badge]]''.

On April 16, 1958, Bickford appeared with [[Roger Smith (actor)|Roger Smith]] in "The Daniel Barrister Story" on [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]]'s ''[[Wagon Train]]''. In this first season episode, Daniel Barrister, played by Bickford, objects to medical treatment for his wife, Jenny, the victim of a wagon accident. Meanwhile, Dr. Peter H. Culver, played by Smith, has successfully fought a smallpox epidemic in a nearby town. He is brought to the wagon train by scout Flint McCullough, portrayed by series regular [[Robert Horton (actor)|Robert Horton]] to treat Mrs. Barrister. Viewers never knew if Barrister yielded to allow Dr. Culver to treat Jenny.

Bickford continued to act in generally prestigious projects right up to his death. He guest-starred on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Islanders (TV series)|The Islanders]]'' and on NBC's ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'' and ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]''. In his final years, Bickford played [[rancher]] John Grainger, owner of the Shiloh Ranch on NBC's ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' [[Western (genre)|western]] series.

In 1965, he published his autobiography, ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.<ref>Bickford, Charles.  ''Bulls Balls Bicycles & Actors''.  Paul S. Eriksson, Inc., 1965, p 308.</ref>

===Death===
He died in Los Angeles of a blood infection at the age of 76, on November 9, 1967, just days after filming an episode of ''The Virginian''. His death triggered [[Jennifer Jones]]' suicide attempt in November 1967.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-jennifer-jones18-2009dec18,0,1884574.story?track=rss ''L.A. Times'' obituary]</ref>

He had a son, Rex and a daughter, Doris.
