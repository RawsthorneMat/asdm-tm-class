===''Gilligan's Island''===
In 1964, Hale won the co-starring role as [[the Skipper]] on the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''. The series aired for a total of 98 episodes from 1964 to 1967. The role proved to be the most prominent role for Hale, as the show continued to be popular for later generations of viewers due to syndicated reruns. The popularity of the show [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] its actors, making it difficult for them to successfully pursue diversified acting opportunities. They received no substantial residual payments for their roles, and the difficulty in finding roles often created financial hardship and resentment. However, Hale did not mind being so closely identified with the Skipper.<ref>{{cite book|last=Largo|first=Michael |title=The Portable Obituary: How the Famous, Rich, and Powerful Really Died|year=2007|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-123166-5|page=94}}</ref> According to Sherwood Schwartz, he often visited children in hospital dressed as the Skipper.

Hale reprised the role of the Skipper in three television films, ''[[Rescue from Gilligan's Island]]'' in 1978, ''[[The Castaways on Gilligan's Island]]'' in 1979, and ''[[The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island]]'' in 1981. He also voiced the Skipper in two cartoon versions of the series, ''[[The New Adventures of Gilligan]]'' from 1974 to 1977 and ''[[Gilligan's Planet]]'' from 1982 to 1983. Hale also appeared as the Skipper in two unrelated sitcoms, ''[[The New Gidget]]'' in 1987 and ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' in 1989. He also promoted ''Gilligan's Island'' reruns on [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]], alongside [[Bob Denver]]. Denver and Hale also appeared as their characters at various promotional events.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-04/news/mn-92_1_alan-hale-jr|title=Alan Hale Jr., 68; Skipper on TV's 'Gilligan's Island'|last=Lee|first=John H.|date=January 4, 1990|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=December 15, 2012}}</ref>

Dawn Wells said in a 2014 interview on CRN.com with Larry & Nancy Manetti, when asked if Alan Hale Jr. was the consummate professional of the ''Gilligan's Island'' series, "Well, that is so interesting, because Alan Jr. and his father looked so much alike, you don't know, who was who. His father did all the Errol Flynn ... I used to say to Alan, 'How was it growing up in a household, with all those moviestars?' Alan was absolutely, the consummate professional, wonderful gentleman, jovial, never complained ... he was the exact same size of my dad. Everytime he picked me up and hugged me, I thought he was my father, he was my dad." Then, Wells also responded if she ever went to her acting mentor's restaurant, he once owned in Los Angeles, "It was a lobster house on La Cienega Blvd., and he would greet you with his sea hat on, as you can.... but that was after the show; and he had his friend, Anthony, there, with some good food, too." The last question that has ever been asked by Dawn, was if ''Gilligan's Island,'' was nearly his show, "No, no... as a matter of fact, it was interesting when you go back and find the people that they should thought say the other characters, and I understand Alan was doing a movie in Utah and they wanted to bring him to audition and he couldn't get a flight out, so ... he hitchhiked, hitchhiked on the highway and then, he came into audition."<ref>http://crntalk.com/larrymanetti</ref>

During the 1970s, he starred in ''[[The Giant Spider Invasion]]'' (1975) and ''[[Angels Revenge]]'' (1978), both of which were later featured on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' (as was his 1963 film ''[[The Crawling Hand]]'').
