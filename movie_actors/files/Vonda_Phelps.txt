'''Vonda Phelps''' was a child stage actress, vaudeville performer and dancer in the [[1920s in film|1920s]]. She appeared in several of [[silent film]] productions. 

==Child prodigy==
In May 1924 Phelps participated in ''Good Fairy'', a fantasy play in two acts, at the [[Philharmonic Auditorium]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. She performed along with almost twenty other children. Phelps appeared as a dancer at the [[Christmas]] program of the [[Cosmos Club]] the following December. Her presentation was highlighted by a rendition of ''Pierrotte Phantasy''. The dance was her original creation and demonstrated her unique personality. Phelps gave a similar interpretation of the dance at the Ambassador Theater in Los Angeles. Her performance was part of a concert given by ''The Children's Opera'' in June 1926.

Phelps was in two motion pictures in the early 1920s. They are ''The Man Who Waited'' (1922) and ''The Jungle Goddess'' (1922). She appeared as ''June'' as a baby, and ''Betty'' as a little girl, respectively.

==Ephemeral fame==
Her fame as a youth performer did not endure. Phelps is not mentioned in newspaper articles after a reference to her birthday celebration in April 1928. She was given a luncheon at the Elite on [[Hollywood Boulevard]] in Los Angeles. Guests were entertained at a table replete with a centerpiece of [[sweet peas]] rendered in [[pastel]] shades. Later the celebrants went to [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]]. Fellow silent film star [[Virginia Marshall]] was among Phelps' birthday attendants.
