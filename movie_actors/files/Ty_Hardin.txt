'''Ty Hardin''', born '''Orison Whipple Hungerford, Jr.'''  (born January 1, 1930), is a former [[United States|American]] [[actor]] best known as the star of the [[1958 in television|1958]]-[[1962 in television|1962]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]] ''[[Bronco (TV series)|Bronco]]''.

==Early life==
Though born in [[New York City]], Hardin was reared in [[Texas]]. As a growing boy, he had [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], a condition not then diagnosed. His grandmother, with whom he lived part of the time after his parents divorced, nicknamed him "Ty" because he was as active as a "Texas [[typhoon]]". Hardin graduated in 1949 from [[Lamar High School (Houston)|Lamar High School]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. He also attended on a football scholarship [[Blinn College|Blinn Junior College]] in [[Brenham, Texas|Brenham]] in [[Washington County, Texas|Washington County]], Texas, and for one semester Dallas Bible Institute. He served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]]. He was commissioned after attending [[Officer Candidate School]] in [[Fort Monmouth]], [[New Jersey]], and he became a pilot of [[Forward Observer]] [[O-1 Bird Dog]] [[liaison aircraft]]. He attained the rank of [[first lieutenant]]. After  his return from service, he began taking courses at [[Texas A&M University]] in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]] on a football scholarship under coach [[Bear Bryant]], for whom he played tight end.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.tyhardin.net/AllAboutTyHardin.htm|title=All About Ty Hardin|publisher=tyhardin.net|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}</ref>

Working as an electronic engineer at [[Douglas Aircraft]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[California]], Hardin lived with two other A&M Aggies who worked for Douglas. While renting six-guns at a motion picture costume rental company for a costume party, he was discovered by a [[Paramount Pictures]] talent scout.<ref name=bio/> By 1957, Hardin acquired the services of agent [[Henry Willson]] and made his way to Hollywood where he was put under contract by Paramount Pictures. Initially billed as "Ty Hungerford," he made various minor appearances in several Paramount films such as ''[[I Married a Monster from Outer Space]]'' and ''[[Last Train from Gun Hill]]''. 

==Warner Brothers years==

According to Hardin, he tried to obtain a lead role in the film ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' that had been promised to [[Ricky Nelson]]. [[John Wayne]] reportedly saw him when he visited a film set at Paramount and was impressed by his appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvis2001.net/Ty%20Hardin.htm |title=Ty Hardin fansite |publisher=Elvis2001.net |date=2007-07-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Wayne introduced him to [[Howard Hawks]] and [[William T. Orr]] at [[Warner Bros. Television]]; they bargained for his seven-year contract and he moved to Warner Brothers, who changed his stage surname to "Hardin" after the Texas [[gunfighter]] [[John Wesley Hardin]].<ref name=bio/> He also attended actors' school at Warner Brothers and acquired small parts in various Warner productions.

When [[Clint Walker]] walked out on his ABC series ''[[Cheyenne (TV western)|Cheyenne]]'' in 1958 during a contract dispute with Warner Brothers, Hardin got his big break. Warner bought out his contract from Paramount Studios and installed him into the Cheyenne show as the country cousin "Bronco Layne" to complete the season. Walker and Warner Brothers came to terms after the season ended, but Hardin had made such a big hit on the show that [[Jack Warner]] gave him his own series, ''Bronco'', under the Cheyenne title. ''Bronco'' alternated weeks with ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', starring [[Will Hutchins]], and ''Cheyenne'' for four years. The series ran from 1958 to 1962. Hardin was soon given other prominent roles for Warner Brothers productions such as ''[[Merrill's Marauders (film)|Merrill's Marauders]]'', as Doug "Stretch" Fortune in the 1963 [[spring break]] film ''[[Palm Springs Weekend]]'', ''[[The Chapman Report]]'' and ''[[PT 109 (film)|PT 109]].''

==International films==
When his contract expired he left Hollywood to seek opportunity overseas as his series was played all over the world. Like many other American actors, Hardin traveled to Europe where he made several [[spaghetti westerns]] although he turned down [[Sergio Leone]]'s offer to play the lead in ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''. He also appeared in American financed all star epics such as ''[[Battle of the Bulge (film)|Battle of the Bulge]]'' and ''[[Custer of the West]]''. He also was reportedly the first choice to play the starring role in the television series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', which went to [[Adam West]], but turned it down because of film commitments overseas.

Hardin did star in a 1967–1968 Australian television series ''[[Riptide (Australian TV series)|Riptide]]'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicaustraliantv.com/Riptide1.htm |title=Riptide website |publisher=Classicaustraliantv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> where he sponsored an Australian motorcycle racing team and a 1970 German television series called ''On the Trail of Johnny Hilling, Boor and Billy'' which was immensely successful in [[West Germany]].

==Personal life==
Hardin has been married eight times, divorced seven times, and has ten children from five of his marriages. From 1962 to 1966, he was married to the 1961 [[Miss Universe]], German beauty queen [[Marlene Schmidt]], who later involved herself in the movie industry; they had one daughter. As of 2009, Hardin lives with his eighth wife, Caroline, in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Epting|first=Chris|title=Western star is in our midst|newspaper=''[[Huntington Beach Independent]]''|date=March 20, 2014|pages=A1, A3}}</ref> 

Hardin's middle name "Whipple" comes from his great-grandfather, [[William Whipple]] of [[Kittery, Maine|Kittery]], [[Maine]], and [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], [[New Hampshire]], one of the original signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. Reared by his [[Baptist]] grandmother, Hardin is known for his [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] Christian and political views. According to his website:

<blockquote>
...I think our movie industry needs a overhaul and [should] start standing up for the values we uphold as sacred and wholesome for our nation. We are a nation founded on Christian principles and values. Even if you don’t agree with our system, don't ignore its success, as Christian believers built the greatest nation this world has ever seen.<br>             

The fact that we have turned our backs on our godly virtues is the prime reason our nation is headed for a train wreck. How did our [[Jesus]] deal with the money-changers? He threw them out of His church. Who let them back into the church? You did. You’re entitled to believe what you like, but men of [[God]] seeking religious freedom established this nation and we own them our allegiance even if we don’t believe in their God of Creation. Our currency carries their [[trademark]], “In God We Trust”. Live with it and respect it, for if we don’t, we will reap a [[whirlwind]] of disaster like has never been witnessed before in our history. You may not agree with our [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] but ... our [leaders] are destroying our nation’s freedoms with financial bondage and their no-win wars. We cannot sit back and watch our nation being reduced into financial slavery while your children are being stationed all over the world protecting their globalist assets.  ... We will be called on to retake our land for God. I’m referring to the [[Bible]]’s prediction of the last days. What if God is right?  Call me an alarmists or a Bible thumper, but I am preparing for the worst and praying for a [[Christian revival|revival]]. This present collapse of our economy is just a clear picture of the events to come. ...<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tyhardin.net/TyHardinsMessageNew.htm|title=Ty's Message|publisher=tyhardin.net|accessdate=October 14, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>
