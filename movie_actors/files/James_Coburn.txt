==Career==
===Early work===
Coburn's film debut came in 1959 as the sidekick of [[Pernell Roberts]] in the [[Randolph Scott]] western ''[[Ride Lonesome]]''.<ref>{{cite news |work=San Jose Mercury News|title=Coburn's Comfort Zone at Home in Western with Heston and Berenger Supporting|page=6|date=1995-01-22|first=Ron|last=Miller|quote=JAMES COBURN began his movie career in a saddle 36 years ago, playing the gangly and not-too-bright sidekick to bad guy Pernell Roberts in the 1959 Randolph Scott western "Ride Lonesome."}}</ref> Coburn also appeared in dozens of television roles including, with Roberts, several episodes of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Bonanza]]''. Coburn appeared twice each on two other NBC westerns ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'' with [[Dale Robertson]], one episode in the role of [[Butch Cassidy]], and ''[[The Restless Gun]]'' with [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]] in "The Pawn" and "The Way Back", the latter segment alongside ''Bonanza'''s [[Dan Blocker]].<ref>''[[The Restless Gun]]'', [[DVD]], Timeless Media Group</ref> During the 1960 to 1961 season, Coburn co-starred with [[Ralph Taeger]] and [[Joi Lansing]] in the NBC adventure/drama series, ''[[Klondike (TV series)|Klondike]]'', set in the [[Alaska]]n [[gold rush]] town of [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]. When ''Klondike'' was cancelled, Taeger and Coburn were regrouped as [[detective]]s in [[Mexico]] in NBC's equally short-lived ''[[Acapulco (TV series)|Acapulco]]''. Coburn also made two guest appearances on [[CBS]]'s ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', both times as the murder victim in "The Case of the Envious Editor" and "The Case of the Angry Astronaut." In 1962, he portrayed the role of Col. Briscoe in the episode "Hostage Child" on CBS's ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''.

===Stardom===
[[File:James Coburn in Charade.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Coburn in ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' (1963)]]
Coburn became well known in the 1960s and the 1970s for his tough-guy roles in numerous action and western films. He first appeared with Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson in the [[John Sturges]] film, ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', and with Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson in ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', another Sturges film. Coburn played the part of a villainous Texan in the successful ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' (1963). He was then cast as a glib naval officer in [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s ''[[The Americanization of Emily]]''. Coburn was signed to a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox.<ref>Entertainment: Coburn Wins Pact, Role in 'High Wind' He'll Star With Anthony Quinn; Mrs. Ames Pens Kidnaping Tale Hopper, Hedda. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 04 June 1964: A10.</ref> His performance as a one-armed Indian tracker in ''[[Major Dundee]]'' (1965) gained him much notice. 

====''Our Man Flint''====
In 1966, Coburn became a genuine star following the release of the [[List of James Bond parodies and spin-offs|James Bond parody film]] ''[[Our Man Flint]]''. The following year, he was voted the twelfth biggest star in [[Hollywood]].<ref>'Star Glitter Is Catching' By Richard L. Coe. ''The Washington Post, Times Herald'' (1959-1973) [Washington, D.C] 07 Jan 1968: H1.</ref>

In 1971, Coburn starred in the [[Zapata Western]] ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'', with [[Rod Steiger]] and directed by [[Sergio Leone]], as an [[Ireland|Irish]] explosives expert and revolutionary who has fled to Mexico during the time of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the early 20th century. Coburn teamed with director [[Sam Peckinpah]] for the 1973 film ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'', in which he played [[Pat Garrett]]. The two had  worked together in 1965 on ''Major Dundee''. The producer of the film, [[Jerry Bresler (film producer)|Jerry Bresler]], took editing responsibilities away from Peckinpah during post-production. Peckinpah accused Bresler of engaging in sabotage of his film, and he threatened the studio with a lawsuit. [[Columbia Pictures]] relented, mainly because [[Charlton Heston]], the star of ''Major Dundee'', said that he would no longer work for the studio unless Peckinpah was allowed editing rights to the film. Though some of Peckinpah's demands were met, the finished product was still not satisfactory to him, and Peckinpah disowned it. 

Nonetheless in 1973 Coburn was voted the 23rd most popular star in Hollywood.<ref>EASTWOOD SELECTED BOX-OFFICE CHAMPION
Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 02 Jan 1974: d17.</ref>

Peckinpah and Coburn turned next to ''[[Cross of Iron]]'', a critically acclaimed war epic that performed poorly in the United States but was a huge hit in Europe. Peckinpah and Coburn remained close friends until Peckinpah's death in 1984. In 1973, Coburn was among the featured celebrities dressed in prison gear on the cover of the album ''[[Band on the Run]]'' made by [[Paul McCartney]] and his band [[Wings (band)|Wings]]. Coburn returned to television in 1978 to star in a three-part mini-series version of a [[Dashiell Hammett]] detective novel, ''[[The Dain Curse]]'', tailoring his character to bear a physical resemblance to the author. During that same year as a spokesman for the [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company]], he was paid $500,000 to promote its new product in [[television advertisement]]s by saying only two words: "Schlitz. Light."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trivia-library.com/b/what-it-costs-by-barry-tarshis.htm|title=Trivia on What It Costs by Barry Tarshis - Trivia Library|publisher=}}</ref>

===Final years===
Because of his severe [[rheumatoid arthritis]], Coburn appeared in very few films during the 1980s yet continued working until his death in 2002. He spent much of his life writing songs with British singer-songwriter [[Lynsey de Paul]] and doing television series as his work on ''[[Darkroom (TV series)|Darkroom]]''. He claimed to have healed himself with pills containing ''[[methylsulfonylmethane]]'' (MSM) a dietary supplement.<ref>'Coburn beats back tough disease' By Ann Oldenburg. ''USA Today'' [McLean, Virginia] 29 Dec 1998: 02.D Life.</ref> Coburn returned to film in the 1990s and appeared in supporting roles in ''[[Young Guns II]]'', ''[[Hudson Hawk]]'', ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]'', ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'', ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'', ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', ''[[Affliction (film)|Affliction]]'', and ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]''. Coburn's performance in ''Affliction'' eventually earned him an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. In addition, he also provided the voice of [[Henry J. Waternoose III]] in Disney/Pixar's "[[Monster's Inc.]]"

==Cars==
[[File:Bob Bondurant James Coburn 1972.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Bob Bondurant]] teaching Coburn in 1972]]
Coburn's interest in fast cars began with his father's garage business and continued throughout his life, as he exported rare cars to [[Japan]].<ref name="obituary">{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2002/nov/20/guardianobituaries.filmnews | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Veronica | last=Horwell | title=James Coburn | date=2002-11-20}}</ref> Coburn was credited with having introduced Steve McQueen to [[Ferrari]]s, and in the early 1960s owned a [[Ferrari 250 GT Lusso]] and a [[Ferrari 250#250 GT Spider California SWB|Ferrari 250 GT Spyder California SWB]]. His Spyder was the thirteenth of just fifty-six built. Coburn imported the pre-owned car in 1964, shortly after completing ''The Great Escape.'' <ref>{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/05/19/autos/record_ferrari_sale/index.htm?section=money_latest | work=CNN | first=Peter | last=Valdes-Dapena | title=$11 million: Ferrari nets record price | date=2008-05-19}}</ref> The car was restored and sold for $10,894,400 to English broadcaster [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]], setting a [[Most expensive cars sold in auction|new world record for the highest price ever paid for an automobile at auction]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/classic/112_0901_1961_ferrari_250_gt_spyder_california/test_drive.html|title=1961 Ferrari 250 GT Spyder California drive - Behind the wheel of the 11 million dollar Ferrari formerly owned by James Coburn - Motor Trend Page 3|date=1 January 2009|work=Motor Trend Magazine}}</ref>

Cal Spyder #2377 was repainted several times during Coburn's ownership; it has been black, silver and possibly burgundy. He kept the car at his [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]]-area home, where it was often serviced by Max Balchowsky, who also worked on the suspension and frame modifications on those [[Ford Mustang|Mustang GTs]] used in the filming of McQueen’s ''[[Bullitt]]''. Coburn sold the Spyder in 1987 after twenty-four years of ownership. Over time he also owned the above-noted Lusso, a [[Ferrari Daytona]], at least one [[Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308]] and a [[Ferrari P#412_P|1967 Ferrari 412P]] sports racer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/classic/112_0901_1961_ferrari_250_gt_spyder_california/viewall.html|title=1961 Ferrari 250 GT Spyder California drive - Behind the wheel of the 11 million dollar Ferrari formerly owned by James Coburn - Motor Trend|date=1 January 2009|work=Motor Trend Magazine}}</ref>

==Death and legacy==
[[File:James Coburn grave at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Brentwood, California.JPG|thumb|Coburn's grave marker]]
Coburn died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on November 18, 2002 while listening to music at his Beverly Hills home. He was survived by his second wife, Paula (née Murad), son James IV and a stepdaughter. Coburn was cremated, his ashes were interred in [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] and marked by a stone bench inscribed with his name. At the time of his death, Coburn was the voice of the "Like a Rock" [[Chevrolet]] television ad campaign. [[James Garner]] succeeded him for the remainder of it.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Critical analysis==
In ''[[The New Biographical Dictionary of Film]]'', critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] states that "Coburn is a modern rarity: an actor who projects lazy, humorous [[Human male sexuality|sexuality]]. It is the lack of [[neurosis]], an impression of an amiable monkey, that makes him seem rather dated: a more perceptive [[Clark Gable]], perhaps, or even a loping Midwest [[Cary Grant]]. He has made a variety of flawed, pleasurable films, the merits of which invariably depend on his laconic presence. Increasingly, he was the best thing in his movies, smiling privately, seeming to suggest that he was in contact with some profound source of amusement".<ref>Thomson, David. "The New Biographical Dictionary Of Film". Knopf 2004</ref> Film critic [[Pauline Kael]] remarked on Coburn's unusual characteristics, stating that "he looked like the child of the liaison between Lt. Pinkerton and [[Madama Butterfly|Madame Butterfly]]".<ref>Rule, Vera. "James Coburn". The Guardian, Friday 3/6/99</ref> George Hickenlooper, who directed Coburn in ''[[The Man from Elysian Fields]]'' called him "the masculine male".<ref>"Tough Guise". ''People Magazine''.  December 2, 2002</ref> [[Andy García]] called him "the personification of class, the hippest of the hip", and [[Paul Schrader]] noted "he was of that 50's generation. He had that part hipster, part cool-cat aura about him. He was one of those kind of men who were formed by the [[Rat Pack]] kind of style."<ref>Breznican, Anthony. "Actor James Coburn dead of heart attack at age 74". Today's News-Herald. Nov, 20, 2002</ref>
