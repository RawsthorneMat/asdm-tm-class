==Early life==

Cameron was born in 1954 in [[Kapuskasing]], [[Ontario]], the son of Shirley (née Lowe), an artist and nurse, and Phillip Cameron.<ref name="nytimesref">{{Cite news|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|title=‘The Futurist: The Life and Films of James Cameron’|pages=|publisher=New York Times|date=January 15, 2010|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/books/excerpt-the-futurist.html?pagewanted=1|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}</ref><ref name=jcbiog>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = James Cameron Biography (1954-) | work = Theatre, Film, and Television Biographies | publisher = NetIndustries LLC | url = http://www.filmreference.com/film/71/James-Cameron.html | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from [[Balquhidder]], Scotland, in 1825.<ref name="nytimesref"/>

Cameron grew up in [[Chippawa, Ontario|Chippawa]], [[Ontario]], and attended Stamford Collegiate School in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Ontario]]. His family moved to [[Brea, California]] in 1971, when Cameron was 17 years old.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Goodyear| first = Dana | title = Man of Extremes: The Return of James Cameron | journal = [[The New Yorker]]| date = October 26, 2009 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/10/26/091026fa_fact_goodyear | accessdate =January 29, 2010}}</ref> He dropped out of [[Lutheran High School of Orange County]], then attended [[Troy High School]] to further his secondary education.

Cameron enrolled at [[Fullerton College]], a two-year community college, in 1973 to study physics. He switched to English, then dropped out before the start of the fall 1974 semester.<ref>Marc Shapiro, James Cameron: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker, Renaissance Books: Los Angeles (2000), pp.44–47</ref> Next, he worked several jobs, including as a truck driver, writing when he had time.<ref name="filmmakers.com">{{cite web|author=Media Pro Tech Inc. |url=http://www.filmmakers.com/artists/cameron/biography/page2.htm |title=James Cameron Biography by FilmMakers Magazine |publisher=Filmmakers.com |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref> During this period he taught himself about special effects: "I'd go down to the USC library and pull any thesis that graduate students had written about optical printing, or front screen projection, or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology.

Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry after seeing the original ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' film in 1977.<ref>''The Force Is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars'', 2004.</ref> When Cameron read [[Syd Field]]'s book ''Screenplay'', it occurred to him that integrating science and art was possible, and he wrote a 10-minute science-fiction script with two friends, titled ''Xenogenesis''. They raised money, rented camera, lenses, film stock and studio then shot it in 35mm. They dismantled the camera to understand how to operate it and spent the first half-day of the shoot trying to figure out how to get it running.

== Early Career ==

His first film was called ''Xenogenesis'' (1978). He was the director, writer, producer, and production designer for ''Xenogenesis''. He then became a production assistant on a film called ''[[Rock and Roll High School]]'', though uncredited in 1979. While continuing to educate himself in film-making techniques, Cameron started working as a miniature-model maker at [[Roger Corman]] Studios.<ref name="filmmakers.com"/> Making rapidly produced, low-budget productions taught Cameron to work efficiently and effectively. He soon found employment as an art director in the sci-fi movie ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980). He did special effects work design and direction on John Carpenter's ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), acted as production designer on ''[[Galaxy of Terror]]'' (1981), and consulted on the design of ''[[Android (film)|Android]]'' (1982).<ref name="IMDB_JamesCameron">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000116/ |title=James Cameron |year=2011 |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=August 14, 2011}}</ref>

Cameron was hired as the special effects director for the sequel to ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]'', entitled ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]'' in 1981. The original director, Miller Drake, left the project due to creative differences with producer [[Ovidio Assonitis]], who then gave Cameron his first job as overall director. The interior scenes were filmed in [[Rome|Italy]] while the underwater sequences were shot at [[Grand Cayman Island]].<ref name="amazingcameron.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingcameron.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Amazingcameron.com |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref>

The movie was to be produced in [[Jamaica]]. On location, production slowed due to numerous problems and adverse weather. James Cameron was fired after failing to get a close up of [[Carole Davis]] in her opening scene. Ovidio ordered Cameron to do the close-up the next day before he started on that day’s shooting. Cameron spent the entire day sailing around the resort to reproduce the lighting but still failed to get the close-up. After he was fired, Ovidio invited Cameron to stay on location and assist in the shooting. Once in Rome, Ovidio took over the editing when Cameron was stricken with food poisoning. During his illness, Cameron had a nightmare about an invincible robot hitman sent from the future to kill him, giving him the idea for ''The Terminator'', which later catapulted his film career.<ref name="amazingcameron.com"/>

== Major films ==

=== ''The Terminator'' (1984) ===
{{Main|The Terminator}}
[[File:James Cameron.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cameron in September 1986]]

After completing a screenplay for ''[[The Terminator]]'', Cameron decided to sell it so that he could direct the movie. However, the production companies he contacted, while expressing interest in the project, were unwilling to let a largely inexperienced feature film director make the movie. Finally, Cameron found a company called [[Hemdale Film Corporation|Hemdale Pictures]], which was willing to let him direct. [[Gale Anne Hurd]], who had started her own production company, [[Pacific Western Productions]], had previously worked with Cameron in Roger Corman's company and agreed to buy Cameron's screenplay for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. Hurd was signed on as producer, and Cameron finally got his first break as director. [[Orion Pictures]] distributed the film.<ref name="IMDB_OrionPictures">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/company/co0001995/ |title=Orion Pictures Corporation [us] |year=2011 |work=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> Hurd and Cameron were married from 1985 - 1989. 

For the role of the Terminator, Cameron envisioned a man who was not exceptionally muscular, who could "blend into" a crowd. [[Lance Henriksen]], who had starred in ''Piranha II: The Spawning'', was considered for the title role, but when [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and Cameron first met over lunch to discuss Schwarzenegger's playing the role of [[Kyle Reese]], both came to the conclusion that the [[cyborg]] villain would be the more compelling role for the [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[bodybuilder]]; Henriksen got the smaller part of [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective Hal Vukovich and the role of [[Kyle Reese]] went to [[Michael Biehn]]. In addition, [[Linda Hamilton]] first appeared in this film in her iconic role of [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]], and later married Cameron.<ref name=jcbiog/>

''The Terminator'' was a box-office hit, breaking expectations by Orion Pictures executives that the film would be regarded as no more than a sci-fi film and only last a week in theaters. It was a low-budget film which cost $6.5&nbsp;million to make, cutting expenses in such ways as recording the audio track in mono. However, ''The Terminator'' eventually earned over $78&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator.htm|title=The Terminator (1984)|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>

=== ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' (1985) ===
{{Main|Rambo: First Blood Part II}}

During the early 1980s, Cameron wrote three screenplays simultaneously: ''The Terminator'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', and the first draft of ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. While Cameron continued with ''The Terminator'' and ''Aliens'', [[Sylvester Stallone]] eventually took over the script of ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', creating a final draft which differed radically from Cameron's initial vision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazingcameron.com/biography.html |title=Biography |publisher=Amazingcameron.com |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>

=== ''Aliens'' (1986) ===
{{Main|Aliens (film)}}
[[File:Gale Ann Hurd and James Cameron.jpg|thumb|upright|The producing team behind ''Aliens'', James Cameron and Gale Ann Hurd]]

Cameron next began the sequel to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', the 1979 film by [[Ridley Scott]]. Cameron named the sequel ''Aliens'' and again cast [[Sigourney Weaver]] in the iconic role of [[Ellen Ripley]]. According to Cameron, the crew on ''Aliens'' was hostile to him, regarding him as a poor substitute for Ridley Scott. Cameron sought to show them ''The Terminator'' but the majority of the crew refused to watch it and remained skeptical of his direction throughout production. Despite this and other off-screen problems (such as clashing with an uncooperative camera man and having to replace one of the lead actors when [[Michael Biehn]] of ''Terminator'' took [[James Remar]]'s place as Corporal Hicks), ''Aliens'' became a box-office success. It received [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for Weaver, [[Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Music Score|Best Original Score]], [[Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]], and won awards for [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. In addition, the film and its lead actress made the cover of ''TIME'' magazine as a result of its numerous and extensive scenes of women in combat; these were almost without precedent and expressed the [[feminism|feminist]] theme of the film very strongly.

=== ''The Abyss'' (1989) ===
{{Main|The Abyss}}

Cameron's next project stemmed from an idea that had come up during a high school biology class. The story of oil-rig workers who discover otherworldly underwater creatures became the basis of Cameron's screenplay for ''[[The Abyss]]'', which cast [[Ed Harris]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] and [[Michael Biehn]]. Initially budgeted at $41&nbsp;million U.S. (though the production ran considerably over budget), it was considered to be one of the most expensive films of its time and required cutting-edge effects technology. Because much of the filming took place underwater and the technology wasn't advanced enough to digitally create an underwater environment, Cameron chose to shoot much of the movie "reel-for-real", at depths of up to {{convert|40|ft|m}}. For creation of the sets, the containment building of an unfinished nuclear power plant was converted, and two huge tanks were used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2010/11/james-cameron-best-movies.php|title=Flashback Five – James Cameron's Best Movies |publisher=Amctv.com |date=October 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref> The main tank was filled with {{convert|7500000|usgal|L}} of water and the second with {{convert|2500000|usgal|L}}. The cast and crew resided there for much of the filming.

=== ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' (1991) ===
{{Main|Terminator 2: Judgment Day}}

After the success of ''The Terminator'', there had been talk about a sequel to continue the story of Sarah Connor and her struggle against machines from the future. Although Cameron had come up with a core idea for the sequel and Schwarzenegger expressed interest in continuing the story, there were still problems regarding who had the rights to the story, as well as the logistics of the special effects needed to make the sequel. Finally, in late-1980s, [[Mario Kassar]] of [[Carolco Pictures]] secured the rights to the sequel, allowing Cameron to greenlight production of the film, now called ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.

For the film, [[Linda Hamilton]] reprised her iconic role of Sarah Connor.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dougherty |first=Margot |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,314767_7%7C14651%7C%7C0_0_,00.html |title=A NEW BODY OF WORK &#124; Linda Hamilton &#124; Cover Story &#124; News + Notes &#124; Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Ew.com |date=July 12, 1991 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> In addition, Schwarzenegger also returned in his role as The Terminator, but this time as a protector. Unlike Schwarzenegger's character—the T-800 Terminator which is made of a metal endoskeleton—the new villain of the sequel, called the [[T-1000]], is a more-advanced Terminator made of liquid metal, and with polymorphic abilities. The T-1000 would also be much less bulky than the T-800. For the role, Cameron cast [[Robert Patrick]], a sharp contrast to Schwarzenegger. Cameron explained, "I wanted someone who was extremely fast and agile. If the T-800 is a human [[Panzer tank]], then the T-1000 is a [[Porsche]]."

Cameron had originally wanted to incorporate this advanced-model Terminator into the first film, but the special effects at the time were not advanced enough. The ground-breaking effects used in ''The Abyss'' to digitally depict the water tentacle convinced Cameron that his liquid metal villain was now possible.

[[TriStar Pictures]] agreed to distribute the film, but under a locked release date only about one year after the start of shooting. The movie, co-written by Cameron and his longtime friend, [[William Wisher, Jr.]], had to go from screenplay to finished film in just that amount of time. Like Cameron's previous film, it was one of the most expensive films of its era, with a budget of about $100&nbsp;million. The biggest challenge of the movie was the special effects used in creating the T-1000. Nevertheless, the film was finished on time and released to theaters on July 3, 1991.

''Terminator 2'', or ''T2'', as it was abbreviated, broke box-office records (including the opening weekend record for an [[R-rated]] film), earning over $200&nbsp;million in the United States and Canada, and over $300&nbsp;million in other territories, and became the highest-grossing film of that year. It won four [[Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]], [[Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. It was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], but lost both Awards to ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''.

James Cameron announced a third ''Terminator'' film many times during the 1990s, but without coming out with any finished scripts. Kassar and Vajna purchased the rights to the Terminator franchise from a bankruptcy sale of Carolco's assets.<ref>{{Cite news|title=More 'Terminator' on the way|author=Michael Fleming|work=Variety|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117964592.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|accessdate=May 8, 2008 | date=May 9, 2007}}</ref> ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' was eventually made and released in July 2003 without Cameron's involvement. [[Jonathan Mostow]] directed the film and Schwarzenegger returned as the Terminator.

Cameron reunited with the main cast of ''Terminator 2'' to film ''[[T2 3-D: Battle Across Time]]'', an attraction at Universal Studios Florida, Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Japan. It was released in 1996 and was a mini-sequel to ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day''. The show is in two parts: a prequel segment in which a spokesperson talks about Cyberdyne, and a main feature, in which the performers interact with a 3-D movie.

=== ''True Lies'' (1994) ===
{{Main|True Lies}}

Before the release of ''T2'', Schwarzenegger came to Cameron with the idea of remaking the French comedy ''[[La Totale!]]'' Titled ''[[True Lies]]'', with filming beginning after ''T2'''s release, the story revolves around a secret-agent spy who leads a double life as a married man, whose wife believes he is a computer salesman. Schwarzenegger was cast as Harry Tasker, a spy charged with stopping a plan by a [[terrorist]] to use [[nuclear weapon]]s against the United States. [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] and [[Eliza Dushku]] played the character's family, and [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] the sidekick.

Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment signed on with Twentieth Century Fox for production of ''True Lies''. Made on a budget of $115&nbsp;million and released in 1994, the film earned $146&nbsp;million in North America, and $232&nbsp;million abroad. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects.

=== ''Strange Days'' (1995) ===
{{Main|Strange Days (film)}}
An American science-fiction action thriller film directed by Kathryn Bigelow. It was co-written and produced by her ex-husband James Cameron and co-written by Jay Cocks.

=== ''Titanic'' (1997) ===
{{Main|Titanic (1997 film)}}

Cameron expressed interest in the famous sinking of the ship {{RMS|Titanic}}. He decided to script and film his next project based on this event. The picture revolved around a fictional romance story between two young lovers from different social classes who meet on board. Before production began, he took dives to the bottom of the Atlantic and shot actual footage of the ship underwater, which he inserted into the final film. Much of the film's dialogue was also written during these dives.

Subsequently, Cameron cast [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Kate Winslet]], [[Billy Zane]], [[Kathy Bates]], [[Frances Fisher]], [[Gloria Stuart]], [[Bernard Hill]], [[Jonathan Hyde]], [[Victor Garber]], [[Danny Nucci]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]], [[Suzy Amis]], and [[Bill Paxton]] as the film's principal cast. Cameron's budget for the film reached about $200&nbsp;million, making it the most expensive movie ever made at the time. Before its release, the film was widely ridiculed for its expense and protracted production schedule.

Released to theaters on December 19, 1997, ''Titanic'' grossed less in its first weekend ($28.6&nbsp;million) than in its second ($35.4&nbsp;million), an increase of 23.8%.

Cameron had initially next planned to do a film of the comic-book character [[Spider-Man]], a project developed by [[Menahem Golan]] of [[Cannon Films]]. Columbia hired [[David Koepp]] to adapt Cameron's treatment into a screenplay, and Koepp's first draft is taken often word-for-word from Cameron's story,<ref>{{cite news|title=King of the World: The Complete Works of James Cameron|newspaper=Total Film (special supplement; pub.

In its release in 2002, ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' had its screenplay credited solely to Koepp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/detail/id/311891 |title=Who Is Spider-Man? at |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=January 26, 2000 |accessdate=August 27, 2010|archiveurl=http://archive.is/EXms|archivedate=September 6, 2012}}</ref>

Unable to make ''Spider-Man'', Cameron moved to television and created ''[[Dark Angel (TV series)|Dark Angel]]'', a [[superheroine]]-centered series influenced by [[cyberpunk]], [[biopunk]], contemporary superhero franchises, and [[third-wave feminism]]. Co-produced with [[Charles H. Eglee]], ''Dark Angel'' starred [[Jessica Alba]] as [[Max Guevara]], a [[genetic engineering|genetically enhanced]] super-soldier created by a secretive organization. Cameron's work was said to "bring empowered female warriors back to television screens[...] by mixing the sober feminism of his ''[[The Terminator]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' characters with the sexed-up Girl Power of a [[Britney Spears]] concert."<ref>[http://www.darkangelfan.com/news/254.shtml Eyes Only]. DarkAngelFan.com.</ref> While a success in its first season, low ratings in the second led to its cancellation. Cameron himself directed the series finale, a two-hour episode wrapping up many of the series' loose ends.

== Influence ==

Cameron's directorial style has provided great influence throughout the film industry. ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' creator [[Joss Whedon]] stated that Cameron's approach to action scenes was influential to those in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.

== Reputation ==

In 1999, Cameron was labeled selfish and cruel by one collaborator, author [[Orson Scott Card]], who had been hired a decade earlier to work with Cameron on the [[novelization]] of ''The Abyss''. Card said the experience was "hell on wheels. He was very nice to me, because I could afford to walk away. But he made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better. And unless he changes his way of working with people, I hope he never directs anything of mine. In fact, now that this is in print, I can fairly guarantee that he will never direct anything of mine. Life is too short to collaborate with selfish, cruel people."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timp.net/osclistgallery/transcript990831.htm |title= Author Chat Transcript |date=August 31, 1999|publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]]}}</ref> He later alluded to Cameron in his review of ''[[Me and Orson Welles]]'', where he described witnessing a famous director chew out an assistant for his own error.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/everything/2010-01-03.shtml |title=Uncle Orson Reviews Everything: ''Orson Welles Up in the Air''|date= January 3, 2010}}</ref>

After working with Cameron on ''Titanic'', [[Kate Winslet]] decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned "a lot of money". She said that Cameron was a nice man, but she found his temper difficult to deal with.<ref name="return">{{Cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article2144052.ece|title=The Return of James Cameron|last=Gumbel|first=Andrew|date=January 11, 2007|work=[[The Independent]] | location=London}}</ref> In an editorial, the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' said that Cameron "is a nightmare to work with.

He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner, as well as his flaming temper."<ref name="return"/>

[[Sam Worthington]], who worked with Cameron, stated on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' that Cameron had very high expectations from everyone: he would use a [[nail gun]] to nail the film crew's cell phones to a wall above an exit door in retaliation for unwanted ringing during production.<ref>[http://www.hulu.com/watch/116108/the-jay-leno-show-sam-worthingtons-avatar-clip-and-car-crash Worthington's appearance]{{dead link|date=January 2011}} on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]''</ref> Other actors, such as [[Bill Paxton]] and [[Sigourney Weaver]], have praised Cameron's perfectionism.

Composer [[James Horner]] refused to work with Cameron for a decade following their strained working relationship on 1986's ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'';{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} they eventually settled their differences, and Horner went on to score both ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''.

An [[Raising the Bar (South Park)|episode of ''South Park'']] from [[South Park (season 16)|its 16th season]] depicted the director as being self-obsessed. He is seen going deep sea diving while playing his own theme song and appearing oblivious to his overtly bored ship's crew. However, the episode also credits him for "raising the bar" on entertainment.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

During the [[70th Golden Globe Awards]] ceremony, co-host [[Amy Poehler]] prompted laughter and audible gasps<ref name="cnnamy"/> when she joked about a controversy around the [[Zero Dark Thirty#Torture|depiction of torture in ''Zero Dark Thirty'']], a film co-produced and directed by Cameron's ex-wife [[Kathryn Bigelow]].

In a 2015 interview together, actresses [[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], who both worked with Cameron, commented very positively on him. Curtis stated " the truth is he can do every other job [than acting]. I'm talking about every single department, from art direction to props to wardrobe to cameras, he knows more than everyone doing the job." Weaver answered "There are very few geniuses in the world, let alone in our business, and he's certainly one of them." She also said " he's misunderstood in the industry, somewhat.

== Recurring themes ==

Cameron's films have recurring themes and subtexts. These include the conflicts between humanity and technology,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etatsdulieu.wordpress.com/2009/12/27/de-star-wars-a-avatar-prouesse-technologique-et-science-fiction-politique/|title=De Star Wars à Avatar : prouesse technologique et science-fiction politique|last=P Vlad|date=December 27, 2009|language=fr|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref> the dangers of corporate greed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celluloidfun.com/avatar-in-3d-scifi-fantasy-action-drama-film-review/|title=Avatar in 3D; sci-fi fantasy action drama film review |last=Linh|date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref> strong female characters,<ref name="Popc">{{cite web|url=http://popculturezoo.com/archives/5016|title=Review: James Cameron's ‘Avatar’|last=Joseph Dilworth Jr.|date=December 18, 2009|accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref> and a strong romance subplot.<ref name="Popc"/> In almost all films, the main characters usually get into dramatic crisis situations with significant threats to their own life or even the threat of an impending [[apocalypse]].
While ''The Abyss'' dealt with deep sea exploration (shot in an unfinished nuclear reactor filled with water) and Cameron himself became an expert in the field of deep-sea wreckage exploration, exploring the wreckage of the ''Titanic'' and the ''Bismarck''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/cameron-10397|title=Who2 Biography: James Cameron, Filmmaker |last=Nathan Southern|publisher=All Movie Guide |accessdate=January 2, 2010}}</ref> Cameron will return to this theme with ''The Dive'', shooting from a minisub.
