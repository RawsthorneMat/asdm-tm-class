==Film career==
Northern California was her home in 1983 where she was on [[Ernie Reyes]]' West Coast Demonstration Team. At this time [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] was searching in Los Angeles for the next Bruce Lee. Rothrock's forms and maneuvers were observed and Golden Harvest signed a contract with her. It was two years (1985) later that she made her first martial arts [[film|movie]] for them, ''[[Yes, Madam]]'' (also known as ''Police Assassins'' or ''In the Line of Duty Part 2'') which also starred [[Michelle Yeoh]]. It proved to be a box office success.

Rothrock became one of the few western performers to achieve genuine stardom in the local [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong film industry]] before achieving success in their own country. She was credited as 羅芙洛 ("Fu Lok, Law" or "Foo Lok, Law") in many Hong Kong movies.<ref name="Palmer1995">{{cite book|last=Palmer|first=Bill|title=The Encyclopedia of Martial Arts Movies|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qW8rAUX6yvIC&pg=PA411|year=1995|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8108-3027-1|page=411}}</ref> Producer Pierre David initiated Rothrock's move to the American turf.
