Larry Malick was a guitarist who went to study in Spain with [[Andrés Segovia]] in the late 1960s. In 1968, Larry intentionally broke his own hands due to pressure over his musical studies. Emil went to Spain to help Larry, but Larry died shortly after, apparently committing suicide.<ref>Biskind, Peter. ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', Simon and Schuster, 1998. pp.248–249.</ref>

Malick studied philosophy under [[Stanley Cavell]] at [[Harvard University]], graduating ''[[Latin honors#Types|summa cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1965. He went on to [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]]. After a disagreement with his tutor, [[Gilbert Ryle]], over his thesis on the concept of world in [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], Malick left Oxford without a doctorate.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=7oQEgW8u4kcC&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=terrence+malick+gilbert+ryle#v=onepage&q=terrence%20malick%20gilbert%20ryle&f=false | title = Terrence Malick: Film and Philosophy | isbn = 978-1-4411-5003-5 | author1 = Tucker | first1 = Thomas Deane | last2 = Kendall | first2 = Stuart | date = May 12, 2011}}</ref> In 1969, [[Northwestern University Press]] published Malick's translation of [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s ''Vom Wesen des Grundes'' as ''The Essence of Reasons''.

==Film career==
Malick started his film career after earning an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] from the [[AFI Conservatory]] in 1969, directing the short film ''[[Lanton Mills]]''. At the AFI, he established contacts with people such as [[Jack Nicholson]], longtime collaborator [[Jack Fisk]], and agent [[Mike Medavoy]], who procured for Malick freelance work [[script doctor|revising scripts]]. He is credited with the screenplay for ''[[Pocket Money]]'' (1972), and he wrote an early draft of ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971).<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott B. |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/324/324778p1.html |title=IGN: Featured Filmmaker: Terrence Malick |publisher=Movies.ign.com |date=February 19, 2002 |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>

After one of his screenplays, ''[[Deadhead Miles]]'', was made into what [[Paramount Pictures]] felt to be an unreleasable film, Malick decided to direct his own scripts. His first work was ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' (1973), an independent film starring [[Martin Sheen]] and [[Sissy Spacek]] as a young couple on a crime spree in the 1950s. After a troubled production, ''Badlands'' drew raves at its premiere at the [[New York Film Festival]], leading to [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] buying distribution rights for three times its budget.<ref name="Stafford">{{cite news | authorlink=Jeff Stafford |first = Jeff | last=Stafford| title=Badlands | url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=87364&mainArticleId=339836| work=Turner Classic Movies | year=2008 | accessdate=October 19, 2010}}</ref>

Paramount Pictures produced Malick's second film, ''[[Days of Heaven]]'' (1978), about a love triangle that develops in the farm country of the [[Texas Panhandle]] in the early 20th century. The film spent two years in post-production, during which Malick and his crew experimented with unconventional editing and voice-over techniques.<ref>Biskind, Peter. ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'', Bloomsbury, 1998. pp.296–297.</ref> ''Days of Heaven'' went on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography]], as well as the prize for Best Director at the [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]].

{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=Those rambling philosophical voiceovers; the placid images of nature, offering quiet contrast to the evil deeds of men; the stunning cinematography, often achieved with natural light; the striking use of music – here is a filmmaker with a clear sensibility and aesthetic who makes narrative films that are neither literary nor theatrical, in the sense of foregrounding dialogue, event, or character, but are instead principally cinematic, movies that suggest narrative, emotion, and idea through image and sound.

Following the release of ''Days of Heaven'', Malick began developing a project for Paramount, titled ''Q'', that explored the origins of life on earth. During pre-production, he suddenly moved to Paris and disappeared from public view.<ref name="Biskind">{{cite news | last = Biskind | first = Peter | title = The Runaway Genius |work=Vanity Fair  | date = August 1999 | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/classic/features/runaway-genius-199812 | accessdate =October 20, 2010 }}</ref> During this time, he wrote a number of screenplays, including ''The English Speaker'', about [[Josef Breuer]]'s analysis of [[Anna O.]]; adaptations of [[Walker Percy]]'s ''[[The Moviegoer]]'' and [[Larry McMurtry]]'s ''The Desert Rose'';<ref name="Biskind"/> a script about [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]; and a stage adaptation of ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' that was to be directed by [[Andrzej Wajda]], in addition to continuing work on the ''Q'' script.<ref>{{cite news | last = Gillis | first = Joe | title = Waiting for Godot | work=[[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]] |date=December 1995}}</ref> Malick's work on ''Q'' eventually became the basis for his 2011 film ''The Tree of Life''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newyork.timeout.com/arts-culture/film/1456971/the-tree-of-life |title=The Tree of Life |publisher=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] New York |date=May 24, 2011 |accessdate=May 27, 2011}}</ref>

Twenty years after ''Days of Heaven'', Malick returned to film directing in 1998 with ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'', a loose adaptation of the [[James Jones (author)|James Jones]] [[World War II]] [[The Thin Red Line (novel)|novel of the same name]], for which he gathered a large ensemble of famous stars.

After learning of Malick's work on an article about [[Che Guevara]] during the 1960s, [[Steven Soderbergh]] offered Malick the chance to write and direct a film about Guevara that he had been developing with [[Benicio del Toro]].

Malick's fifth feature, ''[[The Tree of Life (film)|The Tree of Life]]'', was filmed in [[Smithville, Texas]], and elsewhere during 2008. Starring [[Brad Pitt]], [[Jessica Chastain]], and [[Sean Penn]], it is a family drama spanning multiple time periods and focuses on an individual's reconciling love, mercy and beauty with the existence of sickness, suffering and death. It premiered at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name="Cannes">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/58041.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Official Selection |accessdate=April 14, 2011|work=Cannes}}</ref> where it won the [[Palme d'Or]]. It also won the [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI Award]] for the Best Film of the Year. At the [[84th Academy Awards]], it was nominated for three awards including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Malick, and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] for [[Emmanuel Lubezki]]. A limited theatrical release in the United States began on May 27, 2011.

{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=More than any other active filmmaker Mr. Malick belongs in the visionary company of homegrown romantics like [[Herman Melville]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Hart Crane]] and [[James Agee]]. The definitive writings of these authors did not sit comfortably or find universal favor in their own time. They can still seem ungainly, unfinished, lacking polish and perfection. This is precisely what makes them alive and exciting: ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', ''[[The Bridge (long poem)|The Bridge]]'' and ''[[A Death in the Family]]'' lean perpetually into the future, pushing their readers forward toward a new horizon of understanding.

Concurrent with the two features, Malick has been working on an [[Imax]] documentary, titled ''Voyage of Time''.
