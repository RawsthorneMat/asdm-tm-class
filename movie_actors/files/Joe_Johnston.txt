== Early life ==

[http://austin.ynn.com/content/entertainment/movies_and_film/279552/austin-born-oscar-winner-directs--captain-america- "Austin-born Oscar winner directs 'Captain America'"], Austin.YNN.com, July 22, 2011.</ref> and attended [[California State University, Long Beach]], and the [[Art Center College of Design]].

== Career ==

===Visual effects===
He began his career as a concept artist and effects technician on the first ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' film, directed by [[George Lucas]]. His association with Lucas would later prove fruitful, winning him an [[Academy Award]] for Best Visual Effects for his work on Lucas and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.<ref>Buchanan, Jason. [http://www.allmovie.com/artist/joe-johnston-96246 "Film > Film Biography > Joe Johnston"], AllMovie.com, n.d.</ref> He continued to work on many films as an effects expert, and acted as associate producer on the film ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.

In 1984, Lucas gave him a sabbatical, with salary, and paid his tuition to attend the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-03-08/features/0403080253_1_joe-johnston-hidalgo-johnston-earned |title=2004 interview with Joe Johnston. Retrieved 12 August 2012 |publisher=Articles.baltimoresun.com |date=2004-03-08 |accessdate=2014-01-11}}</ref> Johnston left after a year, saying he "was asked not to return" because he "broke too many rules".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/interview-director-joe-johnston-captain-america-the-first-avenger.php |title=2001 '&#39;filmschoolrejects'&#39; website interview with Joe Johnston.

===Directing===
Johnston made his directorial debut with the hit ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'', and followed this with the [[comic-book]] adaptation ''[[The Rocketeer (film)|The Rocketeer]]'' (1991). The film was a commercial failure, as was his next, the animated and live-action ''[[The Pagemaster]]''. Johnston rebounded, directing the family hit ''[[Jumanji]]'', starring [[Robin Williams]]. The film overcame lukewarm reviews to gross over $260 million.<ref name="boxofficemojo.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jumanji.htm|title=Jumanji (1995) - Box Office Mojo|work=boxofficemojo.com}}</ref> Johnston was set to direct ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'',<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117434784 | title = A Mania For Marvel | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = April 14, 1997 | accessdate = November 10, 2008}}</ref> but dropped out in July 1997. Johnston then switched gears from effects-driven action films to the more personal and critically acclaimed ''[[October Sky]]'' (1999), starring [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] as a 1950s [[West Virginia]] [[high school]] student who dreams of being a rocket scientist for [[NASA]] despite his father's wishes.

Johnston's first project of the 2000s was the sequel ''[[Jurassic Park III]]''. The film continued his relationship with Spielberg and made over US$300 million at the box office. Johnston followed this with the western ''[[Hidalgo (film)|Hidalgo]]'', starring [[Viggo Mortensen]]. Johnston then took a six-year break before directing the 2010 remake of the 1941 horror classic ''[[The Wolfman (2010 film)|The Wolfman]]'', starring [[Benicio del Toro]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. In part for his experience with the period [[superhero film]] ''The Rocketeer'', Johnston was selected to direct the [[Marvel Studios]] superhero adaptation ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', released July 22, 2011.<ref name=amy>Nicholson, Amy. [http://www.boxofficemagazine.com/articles/2010-01-exclusive-captain-america-jp4-news "Exclusive: 'Captain America' & 'JP4' News"]. ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]]'', January 13, 2010</ref> The film stars [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as the comic-book hero and [[Hugo Weaving]] as his archenemy the [[Red Skull]]. The film is part of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] group of films that also includes ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.

He is the author of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' book ''The Adventures of Teebo: A Tale of Magic and Suspense'', a [[fantasy]] novel tied to ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' (New York: [[Random House]], 1984; ISBN 0-394-86568-5, ISBN 0-394-96568-X).<ref>{{cite web|author=Joe Johnston |url=https://openlibrary.org/b/OL22325365M/adventures_of_Teebo |title='&#39;The Adventures of Teebo'&#39; |publisher=OpenLibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-11}}</ref>
