'''James Roberto "Jim" Jarmusch''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɑr|m|ə|ʃ}};<ref name=pronunciation/> born January 22, 1953) is an [[United States|American]] [[independent film]] [[Film director|director]], [[screenwriter]], [[actor]], [[Film producer|producer]], [[Film editing|editor]] and [[composer]].<ref name=nyt/> Jarmusch has consistently been a major proponent of [[independent film|independent cinema]] since the 1980s.<ref name=atclow/>

==Early life==
{{quote box|align=left |width=25% |quote=The key, I think, to Jim, is that he went gray when he was 15 ... As a result, he always felt like an immigrant in the teenage world. He's been an immigrant – a benign, fascinated foreigner – ever since. And all his films are about that.|source=[[Tom Waits]], as quoted in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2005<ref name=last/>}}
Jarmusch was born to a family of middle-class suburbanites in [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio]] in 1953.<ref name=atclow/><ref name=private/><ref name=chron/> His mother, of Irish and German descent, had been a reviewer of film and theatre for the ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]'' before marrying his father, a businessman of Czech and German descent who worked for the [[B.F. Goodrich Company]].<ref name=bio/><ref name=private/><ref name=correction/> She introduced the future director, the middle of three children,<ref name=last/> to the world of cinema by leaving him at a local cinema to watch matinee double features such as ''[[Attack of the Crab Monsters]]'' and ''[[Creature From the Black Lagoon]]'' while she ran errands.<ref name=hattenstone/><ref name=sfgate/> The first adult film he recalls having seen was the 1958 cult classic ''[[Thunder Road (film)|Thunder Road]]'' (starring [[Robert Mitchum]]) the violence and darkness of which left an impression on the seven-year-old Jarmusch.<ref name=thunder/> Another [[B-movie]] influence from his childhood was ''[[Ghoulardi]]'', an eccentric Cleveland television show which featured horror films.<ref name=sfgate/>

Despite his enthusiasm for film, Jarmusch, an avid reader in his youth,<ref name=atclow/> had a greater interest in literature, a pursuit in which he was encouraged by his grandmother.<ref name=bio/> Though he refused to attend church with his [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] parents (not being enthused by "the idea of sitting in a stuffy room wearing a little tie"), Jarmusch credits literature with shaping his metaphysical beliefs and leading him to reconsider theology in his mid-teens.<ref name=thunder/> From his peers he developed a taste for [[counterculture]]: he and his friends would steal the records and books of their older siblings – [[William Burroughs]], [[Jack Kerouac]], [[The Mothers of Invention]].<ref name=atclow/><ref name=otlesw/> They made fake identity documents which allowed them to visit bars at the weekend but also the local art house cinema – which though it typically showed pornographic films would on occasion feature [[underground film]]s such as [[Robert Downey, Sr.]]'s ''[[Putney Swope]]'' and [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''[[Chelsea Girls]]''.<ref name=atclow/><ref name=otlesw/> At one point, he took an apprenticeship with a commercial photographer.<ref name=atclow/> "Growing up in Ohio", he would later remark, "was just planning to get out".<ref name=otlesw/>

===New York===
After graduating from high school in 1971,<ref name=allmovie/> Jarmusch moved to Chicago and enrolled in the [[Medill School of Journalism]] at Northwestern University.<ref name=chron/><ref name=iFMagazine/> After being asked to leave due to neglecting to take any journalism courses–Jarmusch favored literature and art history–he transferred to [[Columbia University]] the following year, with the intention of becoming a poet.<ref name=thunder/><ref name=iFMagazine/> At Columbia, he studied English and American literature under professors including [[New York School (art)|New York School]] avant garde poets [[Kenneth Koch]] and [[David Shapiro (poet)|David Shapiro]].<ref name=bio/> At Columbia he began to write short "semi-narrative abstract pieces",<ref name=bio/> and edited the undergraduate literary journal ''[[The Columbia Review]]''.<ref name=chron/><ref name=auster/>

During his final year at Columbia, Jarmusch moved to Paris, for what was initially a summer semester on an exchange program but turned into ten months.<ref name=atclow/><ref name=allmovie/> There, he worked as a delivery driver for an art gallery, and spent most of his time at the [[Cinémathèque Française]].<ref name=atclow/><ref name=chron/>
{{quote|text=That’s where I saw things I had only read about and heard about – films by many of the good Japanese directors, like Imamura, Ozu, Mizoguchi. Also, films by European directors like Bresson and Dreyer, and even American films, like the retrospective of Samuel Fuller’s films, which I only knew from seeing a few of them on television late at night. When I came back from Paris, I was still writing, and my writing was becoming more cinematic in certain ways, more visually descriptive. |sign=Jarmusch on the Cinémathèque Française, taken from an interview with [[Lawrence Van Gelder]] of ''The New York Times'', October 21, 1984.<ref name=bio/>}}

Jarmusch graduated from Columbia University in 1975.<ref name=chron/>

Broke and working as a musician in New York City after returning from Paris in 1976, Jarmusch applied on a whim to the prestigious Graduate Film School of [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]] (then under the direction of Hollywood director [[László Benedek]]).<ref name=bio/><ref name=atclow/><ref name=iFMagazine/> Despite his complete lack of experience in filmmaking, his submission of a collection of still photographs and an essay about film secured his acceptance into the program.<ref name=bio/> He studied there for four years, meeting fellow students and future collaborators [[Sara Driver]], [[Tom DiCillo]], [[Howard Brookner]] and [[Spike Lee]] in the process.<ref name=chron/> During the late 1970s in New York City, Jarmusch and his contemporaries were part of an [[alternative culture]] scene centered on the [[CBGB]] music club.<ref name=lat/>

In his final year at New York University, Jarmusch worked as an assistant to the renowned ''film noir'' director [[Nicholas Ray]], who was at that time teaching in the department.<ref name=chron/> In an anecdote Jarmusch has recounted of the formative experience of showing his mentor his first script, Ray disapproved of its lack of action, to which Jarmusch responded after meditating on the critique by reworking the script to be even less eventful. On Jarmusch's return with the revised script, Ray reacted favourably to his student's dissent, citing approvingly the young student's obstinate independence.<ref name=starwars/> Jarmusch was the only person Ray brought to work – as his personal assistant – on ''[[Lightning Over Water]]'', a documentary about his dying years on which he was collaborating with [[Wim Wenders]].<ref name=atclow/> Nicholas Ray died in the summer of 1979 after a long fight with cancer.<ref name=chron/> A few days afterwards, having been encouraged by Ray and New York underground filmmaker [[Amos Poe]] and using scholarship funds given by the [[Louis B. Mayer Foundation]] to pay for his school tuition,<ref name=bio/><ref name=suarez/> Jarmusch started work on a film for his final project.<ref name=nyt/><ref name=chron/> The university, unimpressed with Jarmusch's use of his funding as well as the project itself, promptly refused to award him a degree.<ref name=allmovie/>

==Career==

===First features and rise to fame: ''Permanent Vacation'' and ''Stranger Than Paradise''===
Jarmusch's final year university project was completed in 1980 as ''[[Permanent Vacation (film)|Permanent Vacation]]'', his first feature film. It had its premiere at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg (formerly known as Filmweek Mannheim) and won the Josef von Sternberg Award.<ref name=allmovie/> It was made on a shoestring budget of around $12,000 in misdirected scholarship funds and shot by cinematographer Tom DiCillo on [[16 mm film]].<ref name=first/> The 75&nbsp;minute quasi-autobiographical feature follows an adolescent drifter ([[Chris Parker (actor)|Chris Parker]]) as he wanders around downtown Manhattan.<ref name=postcards/><ref name=vacation/> The film was not released theatrically, and did not attract the sort of adulation from critics that greeted his later work. ''The Washington Post'' staff writer Hal Hinson would disparagingly comment in an aside during a review of Jarmusch's ''Mystery Train'' (1989) that in the director's debut, "the only talent he demonstrated was for collecting egregiously untalented actors".<ref name=hinson/> The bleak and unrefined ''Permanent Vacation'' is nevertheless one of the director's most personal films, and established many of the hallmarks he would exhibit in his later work, including derelict urban settings, chance encounters, and a wry sensibility.<ref name=vacation/><ref name=rediscovering/>

Jarmusch's first major film, ''[[Stranger Than Paradise]]'', was produced on a budget of approximately $125,000 and released in 1984 to much critical acclaim.<ref name=burr/><ref name=sterritt/> A deadpan comedy recounting a strange journey of three disillusioned youths from New York through Cleveland to Florida, the film broke many conventions of traditional Hollywood filmmaking.<ref name=avclub/> It was awarded the [[Camera d'Or]] at the [[1984 Cannes Film Festival]] as well as the 1985 [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film]],<ref name=tasker/><ref name=hartl/> and became a landmark work in modern [[independent film]].<ref name=criterionstranger/>

===''Down by Law'', ''Mystery Train'', and ''Night on Earth''===
In 1986, Jarmusch wrote and directed ''[[Down by Law (film)|Down by Law]]'', starring musicians [[John Lurie]] and [[Tom Waits]], and Italian comic actor [[Roberto Benigni]] (his introduction to American audiences) as three convicts who escape from a New Orleans jailhouse.<ref name=morned/> Shot like the director's previous efforts in black and white, this [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] [[neo-noir]] was Jarmusch's first collaboration with renowned Dutch cinematographer [[Robby Müller]], who had been known for his work with Wenders.<ref name=law/>

His next two films each experimented with parallel narratives: ''[[Mystery Train (film)|Mystery Train]]'' (1989) told three successive stories set on the same night in and around a small [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] hotel, and ''[[Night on Earth (film)|Night on Earth]]'' (1991)<ref>See Gabri Ródenas (2009), Guía para ver y analizar Noche en la Tierra de Jim Jarmusch, Barcelona/Valencia: Octaedro/Nau Llibres, ISBNs:  978-84-8063-931-6 /978-84-7642-776-7. Unluckily, It's not in English, just in Spanish</ref> involved five cab drivers and their passengers on rides in five different world cities, beginning at sundown in Los Angeles and ending at sunrise in Helsinki.<ref name=starwars/> Less bleak and somber than Jarmusch's earlier work, ''Mystery Train'' nevertheless retained the director's askance conception of America.<ref name=canby/> He wrote ''Night on Earth'' in about a week, out of frustration at the collapse of the production of another film he had written and the desire to visit and collaborate with friends such as Benigni, [[Gena Rowlands]], and [[Isaach de Bankolé]].<ref name=second/>

As a result of his early work, Jarmusch became an influential representative of the trend of the American [[road movie]].<ref name=rascaroli/> Not intended to appeal to mainstream filmgoers, these early Jarmusch films were embraced by art house audiences,<ref name=rosen/> gaining a small but dedicated American following and cult status in Europe and Japan.<ref name=katzman/> Each of the four films had their premiere at the eminent and discerning [[New York Film Festival]], while ''Mystery Train'' was in competition at the [[1989 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=tasker/> Jarmusch's distinctive aesthetic and ''auteur'' status fomented a critical backlash at the close of this early period, however; though reviewers praised the charm and adroitness of ''Mystery Train'' and ''Night On Earth'', the director was increasingly charged with repetitiveness and risk-aversion.<ref name=allmovie/><ref name=tasker/>

A film appearance in 1989 as a used car dealer in the cult comedy ''[[Leningrad Cowboys Go America]]'' further solidified his interest and participation in the [[road movie]] genre.  In 1991 Jim Jarmusch appeared as himself in Episode One of John Lurie's cult television series ''[[Fishing With John]]''.

===1995–99: ''Dead Man'' and ''Ghost Dog''===
In 1995, Jarmusch released ''[[Dead Man]]'', a period film set in the 19th century American West starring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Gary Farmer]]. Produced at a cost of almost $9&nbsp;million with a high-profile cast including [[John Hurt]], [[Gabriel Byrne]] and, in his final role, [[Robert Mitchum]],<ref name=susman/> the film marked a significant departure for the director from his previous features.<ref name=yabroff/> Earnest in tone in comparison to its self-consciously hip and ironic predecessors, ''Dead Man'' was thematically expansive and of an often violent and progressively more surreal character.<ref name=allmovie/><ref name=yabroff/> The film was shot in black and white by Robby Müller, and features a score composed and performed by [[Neil Young]], for whom Jarmusch subsequently filmed the tour documentary ''[[Year of the Horse]]'', released to tepid reviews in 1997.
[[File:Jim Jarmusch & Isaach de Bankolé crop.jpg|thumb|Jarmusch (left) and [[Isaach de Bankolé]] (right) promoting ''[[The Limits of Control]]'' at the [[San Sebastian International Film Festival]] in September 2009.]]
Though ill-received by mainstream American reviewers, ''Dead Man'' found much favor internationally and among critics, many of whom lauded it as a visionary masterpiece.<ref name=allmovie/> It has been hailed as one of the few films made by a Caucasian that presents an authentic Native American culture and character, and Jarmusch stands by it as such, though it has attracted both praise and castigation for its portrayal of the American West, violence, and especially Native Americans.<ref name=revisionism/>

Following artistic success and critical acclaim in the American independent film community, he achieved mainstream renown with his far-East philosophical crime film ''[[Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai]]'', shot in Jersey City and starring [[Forest Whitaker]] as a young inner-city man who has found purpose for his life by unyieldingly conforming it to the ''[[Hagakure]]'', an 18th-century philosophy text and training manual for samurai, becoming, as directed, a terrifyingly deadly hit-man for a local mob boss to whom he may owe a debt, and who then betrays him. The soundtrack was supplied by [[RZA]] of the Wu-Tang Clan, which blends into the director's "aesthetics of sampling".<ref>Gonzalez, "[http://volume.revues.org/1973 Jim Jarmusch’s Aesthetics of Sampling in Ghost Dog–The Way of the Samurai]", 2004.</ref> The film was unique among other things for the number of books important to and discussed by its characters, most of them listed bibliographically as part of the end credits. The film is also considered to be a homage to ''[[Le Samourai]]'', a 1967 French New Wave film by auteur [[Jean-Pierre Melville]], which starred renowned French actor [[Alain Delon]] in a strikingly similar role and narrative.

===2004–09: ''Coffee and Cigarettes'', ''Broken Flowers'' and ''The Limits of Control''===
A five-year gap followed the release of ''Ghost Dog'', which the director has attributed to a creative crisis he experienced in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] in New York City.<ref name=hattenstone/> 2004 saw the eventual release of ''[[Coffee and Cigarettes]]'', a collection of eleven short films of characters sitting around drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes that had been filmed by Jarmusch over the course of the previous two decades. The first vignette, "Strange to Meet You", had been shot for and aired on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1986, and paired Roberto Benigni with comedian [[Steven Wright]]. This had been followed three years later by "Twins", a segment featuring actors [[Steve Buscemi]] and [[Joie Lee|Joie]] and [[Cinqué Lee]], and then in 1993 with the [[Short Film Palme d'Or]]-winning "Somewhere in California", starring musicians Tom Waits and [[Iggy Pop]].<ref name=rush/>

He followed ''Coffee and Cigarettes'' in 2005 with ''[[Broken Flowers]]'', which starred [[Bill Murray]] as an early retiree who goes in search of the mother of his unknown son in attempt to overcome a midlife crisis. Following the release of ''Broken Flowers'', Jarmusch signed a deal with [[Fortissimo Films]], whereby the distributor would fund and have "first-look" rights to the director's future films, and cover some of the overhead costs of his production company, Exoskeleton.<ref name=dawtrey/>

In 2009, Jarmusch released, ''[[The Limits of Control]]'', a sparse, meditative crime film set in Spain, it starred [[Isaach de Bankolé]] as a lone assassin with a secretive mission.<ref name=tobias/> A behind-the-scenes documentary, ''Behind Jim Jarmusch'', was filmed over three days on the set of the film in [[Seville]] by director Léa Rinaldi.<ref name=rinaldi/>

In October 2009, Jarmusch appeared as himself in an episode of the HBO series ''[[Bored to Death]]'', and the following September, Jarmusch helped to curate the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music festival in Monticello, New York.

===2010–14: ''Only Lovers Left Alive''===
In an August 2010 interview, Jarmusch revealed his forthcoming work schedule at that time:

<blockquote>
I'm working on a documentary about the Stooges [Iggy Pop-fronted band]. It's going to take a few years. There's no rush on it, but it's something that Iggy asked me to do. I'm co-writing an "opera." It won't be a traditional opera, but it'll be about the inventor Nikola Tesla, with the composer Phil Klein. I have a new film project that's really foremost for me that I hope to shoot early next year with Tilda Swinton and Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska, who was Alice in Wonderland in Tim Burton's film. I don't have that quite financed yet, so I'm working on that. I'm also making music and hoping to maybe score some silent films to put out. Our band will have an EP that we'll give out at ATP. We have enough music for three EPs or an album.<ref name=pitchforkinterview/></blockquote>

Jarmusch eventually attained funding for the aforementioned film project after a protracted period and, in July 2012, Jarmusch began shooting ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]'' with [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Tom Hiddleston]] (who replaced Fassbender), [[Mia Wasikowska]], [[Anton Yelchin]], and [[John Hurt]],<ref name=thr120130/> while Jarmusch's musical project SQÜRL were the main contributors to the film's soundtrack.<ref name="Tilda" /> The film screened at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] and the 2013 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF),<ref name="CannesInComp">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/59652.html |title=2013 Official Selection|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2013|work=Cannes}}</ref> with Jarmusch explaining the seven-year completion time frame at the former: "The reason it took so long is that no one wanted to give us the money. It took years to put it together. Its getting more and more difficult for films that are a little unusual, or not predictable, or don't satisfy people's expectations of something."<ref>{{cite news|title=Cannes 2013: Only Lovers Left Alive a seven year trek says Jim Jarmusch|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/may/25/jim-jarmusch-vampires-only-lovers-left-alive-cannes|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 May 2013|author=Andrew Pulver}}</ref> The film's budget was [[United States dollar|US$]]7 million and its UK release date was February 21, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hiddleston!

==As a filmmaker==
In 2014 Jarmusch shunned the "[[auteur theory]]" and likened the filmmaking process to human sexual reproduction:

<blockquote>
I put 'A film by' as a protection of my rights, but I don't really believe it. It's important for me to have a final cut, and I do for every film. So I'm in the editing room every day, I'm the navigator of the ship, but I'm not the captain, I can't do it without everyone's equally valuable input. For me it's phases where I'm very solitary, writing, and then I'm preparing, getting the money, and then I'm with the crew and on a ship and it's amazing and exhausting and exhilarating, and then I'm alone with the editor again … I've said it before, it's like seduction, wild sex, and then pregnancy in the editing room. That's how it feels for me.<ref name="Tilda" /></blockquote>

===Style===
{{rquote|right|Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is nonexistent. And don’t bother concealing your thievery – celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: “It’s not where you take things from – it’s where you take them to.”|Jim Jarmusch, ''The Golden Rules of Filming''<ref name=golden/>}}

Jarmusch has been characterized as a minimalist filmmaker whose idiosyncratic films are unhurried.<ref name=burr/><ref name=tribune/> His films often eschew traditional narrative structure, lacking clear plot progression and focus more on mood and character development.<ref name=hattenstone/><ref name=tribune/><ref name=rolling/> In an interview early in his career, he stated that his goal was "to approximate real time for the audience."<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Walter |url=http://bombsite.com/issues/2/articles/46 |title=BOMB Magazine — Men Looking at Other Men by Lindzee Smith |publisher=Bombsite.com |accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>

Jarmusch's early work is marked by a brooding, contemplative tone, featuring extended silent scenes and prolonged still shots.<ref name=yabroff/> He has experimented with a vignette format in three films that were either released, or begun around, the early 1990s: ''Mystery Train,'' ''Night on Earth'' and ''Coffee and Cigarettes''. ''The Salt Lake Tribune'' critic Sean P. Means wrote that Jarmusch blends "film styles and genres with sharp wit and dark humor",<ref name=means/> while his style is also defined by a signature deadpan comedic tone.<ref name=tobias/>

The protagonists of Jarmusch's films are usually lone adventurers.<ref name=nyt/> The director's male characters have been described by critic Jennie Yabroff as "three time losers, petty thiefs and inept con men, all [...] eminently likeable, if not down right charming";<ref name=yabroff/> while novelist [[Paul Auster]] described them as "laconic, withdrawn, sorrowful mumblers".<ref name=auster/>

Jarmusch has revealed that his instinct is a greater influence during the filmmaking process than any cognitive processes. He explained: "I feel like I have to listen to the film and let it tell me what it wants. Sometimes it mumbles and it isn't very clear." Films such as ''Dead Man'' and ''Limits Of Control'' have polarized fans and general viewers alike, as Jarmusch stylistic instinct is embedded in his strong sense of independence.<ref name="Jon" />

===Themes===
[[File:Jim Jarmusch Cannes.jpg|thumb|left|Jarmusch at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
Though his films are predominantly set in the United States, Jarmusch has advanced the notion that he looks at America "through a foreigner's eyes", with the intention of creating a form of world cinema that synthesizes European and Japanese film with that of Hollywood.<ref name=bio/> His films have often included foreign actors and characters, and (at times substantial) non-English dialogue. In his two later-nineties films, he dwelt on different cultures' experiences of violence, and on textual appropriations between cultures: a wandering Native American's love of [[William Blake]], a black hit-man's passionate devotion to the ''[[Hagakure]]''. The interaction and syntheses between different cultures, the arbitrariness of national identity, and irreverence towards ethnocentric, patriotic or nationalistic sentiment are recurring themes in Jarmusch's work.<ref name=yabroff/><ref name=klein/>

Jarmusch's fascination for music is another characteristic that is readily apparent in his work.<ref name=allmovie/><ref name=canby/> Musicians appear frequently in key roles – [[John Lurie]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Gary Farmer]], [[Youki Kudoh]], [[RZA]] and [[Iggy Pop]] have featured in multiple Jarmusch films, while [[Joe Strummer]] and [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]] appear in ''Mystery Train'' and [[GZA]], [[Jack White (musician)|Jack]] and [[Meg White]] feature in ''Coffee and Cigarettes''. Hawkins' song "[[I Put a Spell on You]]" was central to the plot of ''Stranger than Paradise'', while ''Mystery Train'' is inspired by and named after [[Mystery Train|a song]] popularized by [[Elvis Presley]], who is also the subject of a vignette in ''Coffee and Cigarettes''.<ref name=allmovie/> In the words of critic [[Vincent Canby]], "Jarmusch's movies have the tempo and rhythm of blues and jazz, even in their use – or omission – of language. His films work on the senses much the way that some music does, unheard until it's too late to get it out of one's head."<ref name=canby/>

On his narrative focus, Jarmusch remarked in a 1989 interview, "I'd rather make a movie about a guy walking his dog than about the emperor of China."<ref name=sante/>

===Impact and legacy===
Jarmusch is ascribed as having instigated the American independent film movement with ''Stranger Than Paradise''.<ref name=morned/> In her description of the film in a 2005 profile of the director for ''[[The New York Times]]'', critic Lynn Hirschberg declared that ''Stranger than Paradise'' "permanently upended the idea of independent film as an intrinsically inaccessible avant-garde form".<ref name=last/> The success of the film accorded the director a certain iconic status within [[arthouse cinema]], as an idiosyncratic and uncompromising [[auteur]], exuding the aura of urban cool embodied by [[downtown Manhattan]].<ref name=indians/><ref name=rosenbaum/> Such perceptions were compounded with the release of his subsequent features in the late 1980s, establishing him as one of the generation's most prominent and influential independent filmmakers.<ref name=blair/><ref name=slpd/>

New York critic and festival director Kent Jones undermined the "urban cool" association that Jarmusch has garnered and was quoted in a February 2014 media article, following the release of his eleventh feature film:

<blockquote>
There's been an overemphasis on the hipness factor – and a lack of emphasis on his incredible attachment to the idea of celebrating poetry and culture. You can complain about the preciousness of a lot of his movies, [but] they are unapologetically standing up for poetry. [His attitude is] 'if you want to call me an elitist, go ahead, I don't care'.<ref name="Jon">{{cite news|title=Jim Jarmusch: how the film world's maverick stayed true to his roots|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/22/jim-jarmusch-only-lovers-left-alive|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 February 2014|author=Jonathan Romney}}</ref></blockquote>

Jarmusch's staunch independence has been represented by his success in retaining the negatives for all of his films, an achievement that was described by the ''Guardian'''s Jonathan Romney as "extremely rare." British veteran producer [[Jeremy Thomas]], who was one of the eventual financiers of ''Only Lovers Left Alive'' called Jarmusch "one of the great American independent film-makers" who is "the last of the line." Thomas believes that filmmakers like Jarmusch "are not coming through ... any more."<ref name="Jon" />

In a 1989 review of his work, [[Vincent Canby]] of ''The New York Times'' called Jarmusch "the most adventurous and arresting film maker to surface in the American cinema in this decade".<ref name=canby/> Jarmusch was recognized with the Filmmaker on the Edge award at the 2004 [[Provincetown International Film Festival]].<ref name=provincetown/> A retrospective of the director's films was hosted at the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during February 1994, and another, "The Sad and Beautiful World of Jim Jarmusch", by the [[American Film Institute]] in August 2005.<ref name=afi/><ref name=king/>

While Swinton, who has worked with Jarmusch on numerous occasions, describes him as a "rock star," the director admits that "I don't know where I fit in. I don't feel tied to my time." Dutch lute player Jozef van Wissem, who worked on the score for ''Only Lovers Left Alive'' calls Jarmusch a "cultural sponge" who "absorbs everything."<ref name="Jon" />

==Music==
In the early 1980s, Jarmusch was part of a revolving lineup of musicians in [[Robin Crutchfield]]'s Dark Day project,<ref name=darkday/> and later became the keyboardist and one of two vocalists for [[The Del-Byzanteens]],<ref name=chron/> a [[No Wave]] band whose sole LP ''Lies to Live By'' was a minor underground hit in the United States and Britain in 1982. Jarmusch is also featured on the album ''[[Wu-Tang Meets the Indie Culture]]'' (2005) in two interludes described by Sean Fennessy in a [[Pitchfork Media]] review of the album as both "bizarrely pretentious" and "reason alone to give it a listen".<ref name=fennessy/> Jarmusch and [[Michel Gondry]] each contributed a remix to a limited edition release of the track "[[Blue Orchid]]" by The White Stripes in 2005.<ref name=connecting/>

The author of a series of essays on influential bands, Jarmusch has also had at least two poems published. He is a founding member of [[The Sons of Lee Marvin]], a humorous "semi-secret society" of artists resembling the iconic actor, which issues communiqués and meets on occasion for the ostensible purpose of watching Marvin's films.<ref name=last/><ref name=hertzberg187/>

He released two collaborative albums with lutist [[Jozef van Wissem]], ''[[Concerning the Entrance into Eternity]]'' ([[Important Records]]) and ''[[The Mystery of Heaven]]'' ([[Sacred Bones Records]]), in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16306-concerning-the-entrance-into-eternity/|title=Jim Jarmusch: Concerning the Entrance Into Eternity|publisher=Pitchfork Media|first=Marc|last=Masters|date=February 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/11/album-review-jozef-van-wissem-jim-jarmusch-the-mystery-of-heaven/|title=Album Review: Jozef Van Wissem & Jim Jarmusch – The Mystery of Heaven|publisher=Consequence of Sound|first=Adam|last=Kivel|date=November 15, 2012}}</ref>

Dutch [[lute]] composer Jozef van Wissem also collaborated with Jarmusch on the soundtrack for ''Only Lovers Left Alive'' and the pair also play in a duo. Jarmusch first met van Wissem on a street in New York City's [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] area in 2007, at which time the lute player handed the director a CD—several months later, Jarmusch asked van Wissem to send his catalog of recordings and the two started playing together as part of their developing friendship. Van Wissem explained in early April 2014: “I know the way [Jarmusch] makes his films is kind of like a musician. He has music in his head when he’s writing a script so it’s more informed by a tonal thing than it is by anything else.”<ref name="Steve" />

==Awards==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2014}}
In 1980 he won with his film Permanent Vacation the Josef von Sternberg Award at the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg. 1999 he was laureate of the [[Douglas Sirk]] Preis at [[Filmfest Hamburg]], Germany.

In 2004 Jarmusch was honored with the Filmmaker on the Edge Award at the [[Provincetown International Film Festival]].

In 2005 he won the Grand Prix of the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]] for his film ''Broken Flowers''.

==Personal life==
[[File:Jim Jarmusch at CBGB's (edit).jpg|thumb|left|Jarmusch at punk club [[CBGB]] in New York City on November 30, 2003.]]
Jarmusch rarely discusses his personal life in public.<ref name=private/><ref name=hattenstone/> His longtime girlfriend, filmmaker [[Sara Driver]], worked closely with him on his early films; however, the stress this put on their relationship caused them to break up and resolve thereafter not to work together. The couple eventually shared a home and have lived together for many years.<ref name=hattenstone/>

He divides his time in the US, between New York City and the [[Catskill Mountains]] of Upstate New York.<ref name=private/><ref name=freshair/> Jarmusch stopped drinking coffee in 1986, the year of the first installment of ''Coffee and Cigarettes''; although, he continues to smoke cigarettes.<ref name=esquire/>

In a February 2014 interview, Jarmusch expressed his appreciation for Tilda Swinton and women in general, explaining:

<blockquote>
She [Swinton] has an ability to prioritise what's really important in life. Once I was listening to her, I think we were at lunch with Patti Smith, and I thought: 'Oh boy, if all culture breaks down, I'm following them. They're my leaders, the women are the way to go.'<ref name="Tilda">{{cite news|title=Jim Jarmusch: 'Women are my leaders'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/20/jim-jarmusch-women-leaders-only-lovers-left-alive?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2|accessdate=21 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 February 2014|author=David Ehrlich}}</ref></blockquote>

In the same interview, Jarmusch also stated that he is not interested in an eternal life, as "there's something about the cycle of life that's very important, and to have that removed would be a burden."<ref name="Tilda" />

It's the type worn by blues musicians, '50s greasers and the downbeat bohemian odd couple Willie and Eddie of Jarmusch's second film ''Stranger than Paradise''. A small triangular silver Triumph motorcycle pin affixed to the lapel is a tip-off to one of Jarmusch's chief recreational passions. Among Jarmusch cognoscenti, the shock of thick, almost white hair that rises from his head in a handsomely shaped post-punk spike is another unmistakable signature.<br />In the eight years since ''Stranger than Paradise'' became an arthouse hit, Jarmusch has garnered a loyal but limited American audience. Yet abroad, particularly in Japan and Europe, both Jarmusch and his films have achieved cult status. For foreigners, perhaps even more so than for Americans, Jarmusch's films are the sine qua non of post-modern American hipdom. They articulate a distinctly funky, low-tech, outcast vision of American society that in both ethos and esthetics draws upon and amusingly blends the past five decades of postwar culture. While in content his films quietly defy Hollywood's myths of American progress and prosperity, in form (due to their stylistic simplicity and small budgets) they are a retort to the movie industry's bloated excess.<br />Recently, at the Yugoslavian film festival, 6,000 people turned out to fill a 4,000-seat theater for a midnight showing of Jarmusch's latest film, ''Night on Earth'' in wartorn Belgrade. In the past several months a traveling "Jim Jarmusch Film Festival" was held in major cities throughout Poland. {{Sic|nolink=y|Czechosl|avakia}} will soon hold such a festival. And in Japan, where the director is a national celebrity, he is offered huge sums to appear in and direct commercials. To date he has turned down all offers.}}
