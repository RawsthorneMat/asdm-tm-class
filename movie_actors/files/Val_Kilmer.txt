==Career==

===1980s===
In 1981, while at Juilliard, Kilmer co-authored and starred in the play ''How It All Began'',<ref name="how">{{cite web |title=Val Kilmer Biography (1959–) |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/15/Val-Kilmer.html |accessdate=February 18, 2008}}</ref> which was performed at the [[Public Theater]] at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. Kilmer turned down a role in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1983 film, ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'', as he had prior theatre commitments.<ref name="outsiders">{{cite news |work=The Irish Times |title=Val finds his voice |url=http://www.planetkilmer.com/discus/messages/407/1055.html?921547260 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050311122221/http://www.planetkilmer.com/discus/messages/407/1055.html?921547260 |archivedate=March 11, 2005 |accessdate=October 24, 2009 |date=December 19, 1998 |last1=Dening |first1=Penelope |quote=I turned down a role in The Outsiders, because I was doing Shakespeare at the time and I thought it was right to stay with the play.

Tom Cruise and a whole bunch of actors.}}</ref> In 1983 he appeared Off Broadway in "The Slab Boys" with [[Kevin Bacon]] and [[Sean Penn]]. That same year, his first off-stage acting role (excluding television commercials) came in the form of a television short titled ''[[One Too Many]]'', which was an educational drama on drinking and driving;<ref name="onetoo">{{cite web |publisher=RetroJunk |title=Val Kilmer |url=http://www.retrojunk.com/details_person/4/ |accessdate=May 11, 2006}}</ref> it also starred a young [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]. Also in 1983, Kilmer self-published a collection of his own poetry entitled "My Edens After Burns", that included poems inspired by his time with Pfeiffer. The book of poems is difficult to obtain, expensive and even second-hand copies fetch $300 and up.<ref>http://www.bookride.com/2007/02/my-edens-after-burns-val-kilmer.html</ref><ref>http://www.thespiannet.com/actors/K/kilmer_val/index.shtml</ref><ref name="movies.yahoo.com">http://movies.yahoo.com/person/val-kilmer/</ref>

His big break came when he received top billing in the comedy spoof of spy movies ''[[Top Secret!]]'', where he played an American rock and roll star. Kilmer sang all the songs in the film and released an album under the film character's name, "Nick Rivers".<ref name="actorsstudio">{{cite episode |title=Episode #6.11 |series=[[Inside the Actors Studio]] |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0611293/ |accessdate=November 9, 2007

During a brief hiatus, he backpacked throughout Europe before going on to play the lead character in the 1985 comedy ''[[Real Genius]]''. He turned down a role in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]''<ref name="velvet">{{cite web |publisher=ContactMusic |title=Kilmer's Regret over Early Decisions |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/kilmers%20regret%20over%20early%20decisions |accessdate=May 11, 2006}}</ref> before being cast as naval aviator "Iceman" in the action film ''[[Top Gun]]'' alongside [[Tom Cruise]]. ''Top Gun'' grossed a total of $344,700,000 worldwide and made Kilmer a major star.<ref name="tgun">{{cite web |publisher=The Numbers.com |title=Top Gun |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1986/0TGUN.html |accessdate=May 11, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051204002034/http://the-numbers.com/movies/1986/0TGUN.html<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 4, 2005}}</ref> Following roles in the television films ''[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' and ''The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains'', Kilmer played [[Madmartigan]] in the fantasy ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''; he met his future wife, co-star [[Joanne Whalley]], on the film's set. Kilmer starred in the [[Colorado Shakespeare Festival]] production of ''Hamlet'' in 1988. In 1989, Kilmer played the lead in both ''[[Kill Me Again]]'', again opposite Whalley, and in [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s ''[[Billy the Kid (1989 film)|Billy the Kid]]''.

===1990s===

====1990–95====
After several delays, director [[Oliver Stone]] finally started production on the film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', based on the band of the same name. Kilmer spoke with Oliver Stone early on, concerned about what he might want to do with the story because Kilmer didn’t believe in or want to promote substance abuse. Kilmer saw Morrison as having picked the wrong heroes, who had different issues, that were not part of the creativity or inspiration. Kilmer saw Morrison's story as one that could be told "a thousand different ways" and didn’t want to tell it by playing the role in the style of drugs, with which Oliver Stone agreed.<ref name="angelfire.com">http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/safari/bravoframe.html</ref> Kilmer memorized the lyrics to all of lead singer [[Jim Morrison]]'s songs prior to his audition, and sent a video of himself performing some Doors songs to director Stone. Stone was not impressed with the tape, but [[Paul Rothchild]] (the original producer of The Doors) said "I was shaken by it" and suggested they record Kilmer in the studio. After Kilmer was cast as Morrison, he prepared for the role by attending Doors tribute concerts and reading Morrison's poetry.<ref name="doors">{{cite web |publisher=Alexander-the-great.co.uk |title=Val Kilmer |url=http://www.alexander-the-great.co.uk/val_kilmer.htm |accessdate=May 12, 2006}}</ref>

He spent close to a year before production dressing in Morrison-like clothes, and spent time at Morrison's old hangouts along the [[Sunset Strip]]. His portrayal of Morrison was praised and members of The Doors noted that Kilmer did such a convincing job that they had trouble distinguishing his voice from Morrison's. Paul Rothchild played Val's version of 'The End' for Robby Krieger, and he told him "I'm really glad they got 'The End'. We never got a recording of that live with Jim and now we've got it." However, Doors keyboardist, [[Ray Manzarek]], was less than enthusiastic with how Morrison was portrayed by director Oliver Stone's interpretation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Manzarek|first=Ray|title=Light My Fire: My Life With The Doors|year=1998|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-399-14399-8|pages=251–252}}</ref>

In the early 1990s, Kilmer starred in the mystery thriller ''[[Thunderheart]]'', action comedy ''[[The Real McCoy (film)|The Real McCoy]]'', and again teamed with ''Top Gun'' director [[Tony Scott]] to play [[Elvis]] in ''[[True Romance]]'', which was written by [[Quentin Tarantino]]. In 1993, Kilmer played [[Doc Holliday]] in the western ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' alongside [[Kurt Russell]], in what is credited as one of Kilmer's finest performances {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}. In the film, Doc Holliday performs [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]’s [[Nocturne in E minor, Op. posth. 72 (Chopin)|Nocturne in E minor, Op.72, No. 1: Andante]]; however, Kilmer does not play the piano and he practiced that one piece for months in preparation. 1995 saw Kilmer star in ''[[Wings of Courage]]'', a 3D IMAX film, and that same year, he starred opposite [[Al Pacino]] and [[Robert De Niro]] in ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'', which is now considered one of the best crime/drama films of the 1990s.<ref name="heatrot">{{cite web |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=Heat (1995) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1068182-heat/ |accessdate=May 11, 2006}}</ref>

====Batman====
In December 1993, ''[[Batman Forever]]'' director [[Joel Schumacher]] had seen ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' and was most impressed with Kilmer's performance as [[Doc Holliday]]. Schumacher felt him to be perfect for the role of the Caped Crusader, though at the time, the role was still [[Michael Keaton]]'s.<ref name="hold">{{cite news |last=Nathan |first=Ian |title=Hold me, thrill me, kiss me, Kilmer |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |pages=108–117 |date=August 1995}}</ref> In July 1994, Keaton decided not to return for a third Batman film after 1992's ''[[Batman Returns]]'',<ref name="next">{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Gordinier |title=Next At Batman |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=July 15, 1994 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302969,00.html |accessdate=October 14, 2007}}</ref> due to "creative differences".<ref name="hold" /> [[William Baldwin]] (who previously worked with Schumacher on ''[[Flatliners]]'') was reported to be a top contender, though just days after Keaton dropped out, Kilmer was cast.<ref name="next" /> Kilmer took the role without even knowing who the new director was and without reading the script.<ref name="hold" />

Released in June 1995, ''Batman Forever'' was a success at the box office,<ref name="batman">{{cite web |publisher=The Numbers.com |title=Batman Forever |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0BTM3.html |accessdate=May 11, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060508133948/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0BTM3.html<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 8, 2006}}</ref> despite receiving mixed reviews from critics.<ref name="batmant">{{cite web |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=Batman Forever (1995) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_forever/ |accessdate=May 11, 2006}}</ref> There was debate about Kilmer's performance; some critics charged that Kilmer, while physically fit to play Batman, more so than his predecessor Michael Keaton had been, gave a wooden performance as [[Bruce Wayne]]. Other critics though, such as [[Roger Ebert]], had kind words for Kilmer. Batman creator [[Bob Kane]] said in a ''[[Cinescape]]'' interview that of all the actors to have played Batman up to that point, he felt Kilmer had given the best interpretation. Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] (who criticized the dark tone contained in ''Batman Returns'') complimented Kilmer's portrayal when he reviewed the film for his expanding collection of film reviews, as well as being very favorable of the film as a whole. Defenders of ''Batman Forever'' praised the film for portraying Batman as a more heroic, less ruthless, and more human character than in the Tim Burton films. The film also brought the film interpretation of Bruce Wayne more into line with his comic book counterpart, showing him as a socialite and a very public figure rather than the neurotic recluse of the previous films.

In February 1996, Kilmer decided not to return for another Batman feature film, feeling that Batman was being marginalized in favor of the villains.<ref name="tight">{{cite news |title=A Tights Squeeze |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 8, 1996 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291605,00.html |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |first1=Steve |last1=Daly |first2=Anne |last2=Thompson}}</ref> [[George Clooney]] replaced Kilmer as Batman in 1997's ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''. Kilmer also decided he wanted to do ''[[The Saint (film)|The Saint]]'', which seemed "very different, fun" to be a thief who was pleased by "entertaining himself with the characters he would create".{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} There were also reports that Kilmer had not had a good working relationship with Schumacher, as another reason for not reprising the role.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

====1996–99====
In 1996, he appeared in a largely unknown film, ''Dead Girl'', and starred alongside [[Marlon Brando]] in the poorly received<ref name="moreaut">{{cite web |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996) |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1072156-island_of_dr_moreau/ |accessdate=May 11, 2006}}</ref> ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau (1996 film)|The Island of Dr Moreau]]''. That year, Kilmer starred alongside [[Michael Douglas]] in the thriller ''[[The Ghost and the Darkness]]''. In 1997 he played [[Simon Templar]] in the popular action film, ''[[The Saint (film)|The Saint]]''. Kilmer looked forward to the title role as a change toward a more fun, less serious action thriller, while enjoying the "master of disguise" chameleon characters like a mad artist, a nerdy British scientist, a cleaner, and a Russian mob boss. Kilmer also wrote the poetry in the film.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120053/trivia</ref> He received a salary of $6 million for the movie.<ref name="tight">A Tights Sqeeze</ref> ''The Saint'' was a financial success, grossing $169.4 million worldwide.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120053/business</ref><ref>http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1997/SAINT.php</ref>

In 1998, he lent his voice to the animated film ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' as [[Moses]], before starring in the [[independent film]] ''[[Joe the King]]'' (1999). Also in 1999, he played a blind man in the drama/romance ''[[At First Sight]]'', which he described as being, of then, the hardest role he had ever had.<ref name="biz">{{cite web | publisher = Mr. Showbiz | title = Val Kilmer: The actor formerly known as Batman and The Saint talks about playing more down-to-earth roles, how he found love At First Sight, why he's on the outs with Kevin Spacey, and much more | url = http://www.planetkilmer.com/movies/afs/articles/mrshowbiz/showbiz.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051221113015/http://www.planetkilmer.com/movies/afs/articles/mrshowbiz/showbiz.html | archivedate = December 21, 2005 | accessdate = October 24, 2009 | last1 = Maynard | first1 = Kevin | quote = [Was playing a blind person a big challenge?] It's probably the hardest role I've ever played.}}</ref>

That same year, he released a CD, proceeds of which went to his charity interests.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In 2008, Kilmer starred alongside [[Stephen Dorff]] in the Sony and Stage 6 film ''[[Felon (film)|Felon]]''. The film was given only a limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles in 2008, but it developed into a success secondary to positive word of mouth.

Kilmer was the voice of the car [[KITT]] for the 2008 ''[[Knight Rider (2008 film)|Knight Rider]]'' TV pilot film and the following [[Knight Rider (2008 TV series)|television series]]. He replaced [[Will Arnett]], who had to step down from the role due to contractual conflict with [[General Motors]]. In keeping with tradition established by the original ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' series and original KITT actor [[William Daniels]], Kilmer was [[Billing (film)#Unbilled appearances|uncredited]] for the role on-screen. He next starred alongside [[Nicolas Cage]] in the [[Werner Herzog]] film ''[[The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans]]'', and alongside [[50 Cent|Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson]] in ''[[Streets of Blood]]''. Both were released in 2009. He appeared as the main antagonist "Mongoose" in a live TV series adaptation of the comic/video game of ''[[XIII (TV Mini-series)|XIII]]'' on NBC in 2009.

===2010s===
In 2010, Kilmer starred in the horror film from [[Michael Oblowitz]], ''[[The Traveler (2010 film)|The Traveler]]'', where he played the [[vengeful spirit]] of a man who had been tortured and murdered while in police custody. In November 2010, Kilmer was filming in [[Kelseyville, California]]. He was finally able to work with his lifelong friend  [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and star in the film ''[[Twixt (film)|Twixt]]''.  The film was filmed mostly on Coppola's estate in [[Napa County]]. The filming was expected to take five weeks and was being independently funded by Coppola. In 2010, Kilmer appeared as the villain Dieter Von Cunth in ''[[MacGruber (film)|MacGruber]]'', and [[Tenacious D]]'s music video "To Be The Best" as a small cameo role.

Kilmer spoke at the May 5, 2010, commencement ceremonies of [[William Woods University]] in [[Fulton, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.williamwoods.edu/media_relations/docs/clippings/2012/5_1_12_clippings.pdf | title = Kilmer speaks at WWU | newspaper = Louisiana Press-Journal | location = Pike County, Louisiana, Missouri | date = 30 May 2012}}</ref> During his week-long visit on campus, he also performed his one-man play, ''[[Citizen Twain]]''.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://news.williamwoods.edu/index.php/val-kilmer-brings-one-man-show-citizen-twain-to-wwu/ | title = Val Kilmer brings one-man show, 'Citizen Twain,' to WWU |date = 16 April 2010 | publisher = William Woods University}}</ref><ref name=DrKilmer>{{cite press release | url = http://news.williamwoods.edu/index.php/actor-val-kilmer-now-dr-kilmer-thanks-to-william-woods-university/ | title = Actor Val Kilmer now ‘Dr. Kilmer,’ thanks to William Woods University | date = 14 May 2012 | publisher = William Woods University}}</ref> He received an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[doctorate]] "in recognition of his creative abilities and his contributions to art and theater."<ref name=DrKilmer/>

In 2012, Kilmer received a [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Spoken Word.  He also starred in Harmony Korine's short "The Lotus Community Workshop" which is part of a collaborative film [[The Fourth Dimension (film)|The Fourth Dimension]]. He plays a version of himself from an alternate reality, that is a former actor, turned self-help guru. ''The Fourth Dimension'' is a collection of three standalone short films about parallel universes produced by Vice Films in collaboration with Grolsch Film Works, a new division of the namesake beer company. Kilmer notes that his addition to the list of actors, including [[John Malkovich]] (''[[Being John Malkovich]]'') and [[Al Pacino]] ([[Jack and Jill (2011 film)|''Jack and Jill'']]), that mock their real-life persona in fictional movies was an accident and says, "I still love saying the premise because it makes me laugh every time."<ref name=independent.co.uk>{{cite news|last=Aftab|first=Kaleem|title=Val Kilmer - The Hollywood bad boy done good|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/val-kilmer--the-hollywood-bad-boy-done-good-7766422.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=May 19, 2012|location=London}}</ref>

Since 2002, Kilmer has been working on a film about the life of [[Mary Baker Eddy]], the founder of the [[Christian Science]] church,<ref name="Klosterman"/> and [[Mark Twain]], one of her most famous critics.  Kilmer is still working on the film, which is about the lives and relationship of Mary Baker Eddy and Mark Twain as "a quirky, tender, tragicomic portrait of two contrasting lives, set against the backdrop of Gilded Age America."<ref>http://twaineddyfilm.com/story.html</ref> ''Citizen Twain'' was initially performed as a one-man show Hollywood workshop in April 2012; it is now the basis of Kilmer's film project, which will be his directorial debut.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> In 2013, he reunited with his ''[[Top Gun]]'' co-star [[Anthony Edwards]] in the Disney animated movie ''[[Planes (film)|''Planes'']]''. Kilmer voiced the character Bravo, while Edwards supplied Echo.

==Influence and public image==
[[Kevin Spacey]] told [[James Lipton]] on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', that one of the turning points of his life was at a high school drama festival when he saw Kilmer and [[Mare Winningham]] perform a scene from ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (play)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' and the drama teacher, Robert Carrelli, invited him to transfer to Chatsworth High School; he accepted. In the same interview, Spacey said he went to [[Juilliard]] because Kilmer did. Kilmer was at that time the youngest person ever admitted to Juilliard. During Kilmer's subsequent "Inside the Actors Studio" interview, he said "Robert Carrelli, who was our teacher, had a knack for producing and directing. And it was either Beverly Hills High, because of their very talented pool of students, or Chatsworth High that would win all these festivals."<ref name="angelfire.com"/>

==Politics and charity work==
Kilmer made several trips to [[New Orleans]] to help in the 2005 [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster relief.<ref>{{cite web|title=Val Kilmer on Bad Lieutenant and Voicing KITT!|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46730|publisher=ComingSoon}}</ref> Kilmer is an ardent supporter of Native American affairs and an advocate of environmental protection.<ref>[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2011/08/28/world-indigenous-business-forum-to-feature-val-kilmer-opportunities-to-build-networks-49379 World Indigenous Business Forum to Feature Val Kilmer, Opportunities to Build Networks]</ref> He briefly flirted with running for [[New Mexico gubernatorial election, 2010|Governor of New Mexico]] in 2010, but decided not to run.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt |url=http://www.nmfbihop.com/diary/3223/val-kilmer-im-not-running-for-governor |title=New Mexico Politics: New Mexico FBIHOP:: Val Kilmer: 'I'm not running' for governor |publisher=Nmfbihop.com |date= |accessdate=October 6, 2010}}</ref>

In May 2013, Kilmer lobbied Congress on behalf of Equitable Access to Care and Health Act, or EACH Act (H.R. 1814), a bill which purports "to provide an additional religious exemption from the individual health coverage mandate" of Obamacare.<ref>{{cite news|title=Val Kilmer On Capitol Hill: Actor Turns Lobbyist For A Day, Takes Many Pictures |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/09/val-kilmer-on-capitol-hill_n_3247206.html?utm_hp_ref=dc | work=Huffington Post | first=Will |last=Wrigley |date=May 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr1814ih/pdf/BILLS-113hr1814ih.pdf</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:Hail-Bacchus Val Kilmer.jpg|thumb|Kilmer reigning as [[Bacchus]]; parade in New Orleans during Mardi Gras in 2009]]
Kilmer was married to actress [[Joanne Whalley]] from March 1988 to February 1996. The two met while working together on the film ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''. The couple had two children: a daughter, Mercedes (b. October 29, 1991), and a son, [[Jack Kilmer|Jack]] (b. June 6, 1995). [[Warwick Davis]], Kilmer's co-star from the 1988 fantasy ''Willow'', in his audio commentary for the film said that the question he's most asked is what it was like working with Kilmer. Though Kilmer has a reputation of being difficult, Davis describes him as a very funny man and a hard working, dedicated actor. Kilmer reunited with Davis in the 2013 Easter special of the sitcom ''[[Life's Too Short]]'', in which he plays a fictionalized version of himself as a mooching, egotistical eccentric.

Other actors have noted that he prepares for his roles extensively and meticulously. [[Irwin Winkler]] (director of ''[[At First Sight]]'') talked about his decision to hire Kilmer. "I'd heard the stories, so I checked him out. I called [[Robert De Niro|Bob De Niro]] and [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], who'd worked with him on ''Heat'', and they both gave him raves... I had a wonderful experience in spite of all the naysayers."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/safari/dads.html |title=In Searcf of Val on the Big Screen |author=Steve Pond |accessdate=8 February 2014}}</ref> [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] (producer of ''Prince of Egypt'') talks about the actor: "Val was one of the first people cast in ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]''. He was there every step of the way; patient, understanding, and phenomenally generous with his time."<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/safari/icon5.html</ref>

In 2011, Kilmer sold his {{convert|6000|acre|km2|adj=on}} ranch in [[New Mexico]], where he would track, hike, fish, and raise [[American Bison|bison]].<ref name="Klosterman">[[Chuck Klosterman]]'s interview in his essay ''Crazy things seem normal, normal things seem crazy'' collected in the New Kings of Nonfiction, edited by [[Ira Glass]]</ref> Kilmer is a devout [[Christian Scientist]].<ref>http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0705VALKILMER_120</ref> He is also an avid musician; he released a CD in the fall of 2007 and donated its proceeds to his charity interests.

===Health===
In January 2015, Kilmer was hospitalized for massive bleeding in his throat.<ref name="health"/> It was reported that Kilmer has a throat tumor and refused to seek treatment due to his religion, though Kilmer denies this.<ref name="health">{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/val-kilmer-ignoring-tumor-faith-report-article-1.2100542|title=Val Kilmer’s family says actor’s faith is hampering tumor treatment: report|publisher=The [[New York Daily News]].com|accessdate=February 5, 2015}}</ref>
