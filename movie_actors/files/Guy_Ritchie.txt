'''Guy Stuart Ritchie''' (born 10 September 1968) is an English filmmaker known for his crime films. He left high school and got entry-level jobs in the film industry in the mid-1990s. He eventually graduated to directing commercials. He made his first film in 1995, a 20-minute short which impressed investors who backed his first feature film, the crime comedy ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' (1998). He then directed another crime comedy, ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' (2000). His next two films, the romantic comedy ''[[Swept Away (2002 film)|Swept Away]]'' (2002) and the crime drama ''[[Revolver (2005 film)|Revolver]]'' (2005) were not commercial or critical successes. The next crime drama, ''[[RocknRolla]]'' (2008), received mixed reviews and a modest box office return. In 2009, he directed his first films in the action mystery genre, with ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2009) and its sequel ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]'' (2011). Both films were major box office successes, and the two films received positive, and moderately positive reviews, respectively.

==Early life==
Ritchie was born in [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire]],<ref name="b"/> the second of two children born to Amber (née Parkinson) and Captain John Vivian Ritchie (b. 1928), former [[Seaforth Highlanders]] serviceman and advertising executive. John's father was Major Stewart Ritchie, who died in France, in 1940, during World War Two.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hero in two world wars|url=http://www.harrymclaughlin.com/Flipbook/Album4Feb2013.html#p=54|accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref>  John's mother was Doris Margaretta McLaughlin (b. 1896), daughter of Vivian Guy McLaughlin (b. 1865) and Edith Martineau (b. 1866). The McLaughlins have a pedigree going back to [[King Edward I of England]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://www.harrymclaughlin.com/Descent_From_King_Edward_I_.pdf|accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Background Information|url=http://www.harrymclaughlin.com/Flipbook/Album4Feb2013.htm|accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref>  Ritchie's mother, Amber, later married a baronet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/16/Guy-Ritchie.html |title=Guy Ritchie Biography (1968–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date=22 December 2000 |accessdate=19 March 2010}}</ref> His father's second marriage was to [[Shireen Ritchie, Baroness Ritchie of Brompton]], a former model and later Conservative politician and life peer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9229647/Baroness-Ritchie-of-Brompton.html |title=Baroness Ritchie of Brompton |date=26 April 2012 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>

==Directing career==
Ritchie directed a 20-minute short film in 1995 entitled ''[[The Hard Case]]''. In 1998, Ritchie and his dad contacted their friend [[Peter Morton]], of the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] chain, wondering if he had any potential investors for a debut film. Morton's nephew, [[Matthew Vaughn]], had been studying film production in Los Angeles. Peter informed Vaughn of Ritchie's new film idea, and Vaughn agreed to produce. Matthew, John, Guy and Peter asked their mutual acquaintance, [[Trudie Styler]], to invest in the production of Ritchie's second film. Styler had seen The Hard Case, and decided that co-funding the project would be a worthwhile opportunity. The production of the film, ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' was completed in about eight months. It was released in Great Britain in 1998, and after positive reviews, became an international success. Richie was introduced to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], whom he would later wed, when the soundtrack for the film was issued on her [[Maverick Records]] label. ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'', which starred [[Nick Moran]], also introduced actors [[Jason Statham]] (''[[The Transporter]]''), [[Jason Flemyng]] and [[Dexter Fletcher]] to worldwide audiences, as well as introducing former footballer [[Vinnie Jones]] to a new career as a film star. In 2000 Ritchie won an [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Ritchie created and produced a spin-off television series called ''[[Lock, Stock...]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|243714|Lock, Stock... (2000)}}</ref>

His second feature film was [[Snatch (movie)|''Snatch'']], released in the year 2000. Originally known as ''Diamonds'', it was another caper comedy, this time backed by a major studio. The cast featured such Hollywood big names as [[Brad Pitt]], [[Benicio del Toro]] and [[Dennis Farina]], along with the returning Vinnie Jones and Statham. Similar to ''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' in featuring a complex and inventive storyline in which the characters weave in and out of each other's lives, the film also plays with time, depicting events from various perspectives. It currently has a rating of 73% on Rotten Tomatoes.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

Following his marriage to Madonna, Ritchie began focusing his filmmaking on his wife, directing her in both a music video (for the song "[[What It Feels Like for a Girl]]", a controversial video that showed Madonna engaging in violent behaviour, ostensibly directed at men, including T-boning a car with three men in it, tasering and robbing a man at an ATM, scratching a police car and shooting two officers with a water gun, driving her car through a group of men playing street hockey and incinerating a man by throwing a lighter into a pool of gasoline) and a short film, ''Star'', for the [[BMW films]] series. Ritchie's next film, also featuring Madonna, was a remake of the 1974 [[Lina Wertmüller]] hit ''[[Swept Away (1974 film)|Swept Away]]'' (also entitled ''[[Swept Away (2002)|Swept Away]]''). Ritchie cast Madonna as a rich, rude socialite who, after a shipwreck, is trapped on a deserted island with a slovenly Communist sailor who humiliates her. Ritchie renamed the woman Amber Leighton after his mother. This film was both a critical and commercial disappointment.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

Ritchie's next project was a Vegas-themed heist film entitled ''[[Revolver (2005 film)|Revolver]]'', which was critically panned in the US and UK.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.filmfocus.co.uk/review.asp?ReviewID=344| title=Revolver Review| author=Simon Guerrier | publisher=filmfocus.co.uk| quote=Tedious, humourless, pretentious and nasty| accessdate=12 December 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2005/09/19/revolver_2005_review.shtml| title=BBC&nbsp;– Movies&nbsp;– review&nbsp;– Revolver| author=Adrian Hennigan|publisher=bbc.co.uk   | quote=plodding pretentiousness in a film that's illuminated by great action set-pieces and some powerful performances, but not redeemed| accessdate=12 December 2007}}</ref>
Ritchie was involved with a hidden camera show called ''Swag'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 11 Guy Ritchie Moments|url=http://www.ugo.com/movies/guy-ritchie-cameraman-stabbed|work=Ugo|publisher=UGO Entertainment|accessdate=18 August 2012|author=UGO Team|date=13 March 2008}}</ref> for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel Five]] in the UK, which turned the table on criminals and opportunists by using stunts to trap them in the act. Ritchie has also written and directed ''[[RocknRolla]]'' starring [[Gerard Butler]]. It scores 60% on Rotten Tomatoes and was generally received well.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.muchmusic.com/news/story.asp?id=19458| title=Ludacris in new Guy Ritchie Film| publisher=Muchmusic| date=26 June 2007| quote=Ludacris scored a role in the latest Guy Ritchie film RocknRolla. | accessdate=12 December 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070926225315/http://www.muchmusic.com/news/story.asp?id=19458|archivedate=26 September 2007}}</ref> Ritchie intends to develop the film into a trilogy, with the next entry being "The Real RocknRolla," as is stated at the end of "RocknRolla." Ritchie will also direct a film based on a comic book series he created with [[Virgin Comics]] entitled ''[[Guy Ritchie's Gamekeeper]]''. The film rights were acquired by [[Warner Brothers]] in July 2007. The film's being produced by [[Silver Pictures]].<ref>[http://www.virgincomics.com/pressrelease_Gk.html News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2008, Ritchie directed a commercial for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] called "Take It To The Next Level", about a young Dutch footballer who signs for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], showing the progression of his career from his viewpoint, until he makes his debut for [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]]. The commercial features cameo appearances from some football players with music by [[Eagles of Death Metal]].<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?in_article_id=145076&in_page_id=43 Guy Ritchie's new Nike advert to hit screens] Metro, 28 April 2008</ref>
Ritchie's movie ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'', starring [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] and [[Jude Law]], received its theatrical release on 25 December 2009. The film was given generally positive reviews<ref>{{cite web| title = Sherlock Holmes (2009)| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sherlock_holmes_2009/| work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]| publisher=[[Flixster]]| accessdate = 31 January 2010}}</ref> and grossed more than $520&nbsp;million worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=sherlockholmes.htm|title=Sherlock Holmes|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> becoming Ritchie's most successful film financially.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Director&id=guyritchie.htm|title=Guy Ritchie Movie Box Office Results|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=26 February 2010}}</ref> The sequel, ''[[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows]]'', was released on 16 December 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title = Untitled Sherlock Holmes (2011|url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1515091/|work=[[IMDB]]|publisher=[[IMDB]]|accessdate = 3 December 2010}}</ref>
