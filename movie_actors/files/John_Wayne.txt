'''Marion Mitchell Morrison'''<!--Please do not change without reading Talk page regarding Wayne's actual real name.--> (born '''Marion Robert Morrison'''; May 26, 1907&nbsp;– June 11, 1979), better known by his stage name '''John Wayne''', was an American film actor, director, and producer.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kehr |first=Dave |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/w/john_wayne/index.html |title=John Wayne News|work=The New York Times |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref> An [[Academy Award]]-winner, Wayne was among the top box office draws for three decades.<ref name="numbers">{{cite web|title=John Wayne |publisher=The Numbers |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/people/0JWAY.php |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelclassics.com/Articles/General/quigleytop10-article.htm |title=Quigley's Annual List of Box-Office Champions, 1932–1970 |publisher=Reel Classics|accessdate=March 25, 2012}}</ref> An enduring American icon, he epitomized rugged masculinity and is famous for his demeanor, including his distinctive calm voice, walk, and height.

Wayne was born in  [[Winterset, Iowa]], but his family relocated to the greater [[Los Angeles]] area when he was nine years old. He graduated from [[Glendale High School (Glendale, California)]]. He found work at local film studios when he lost his [[American football|football]] scholarship to [[University of Southern California|USC]] as a result of a [[bodysurfing]] accident.<ref name=RobertsOlson1995>{{cite book |last1= Roberts|first1= Randy|last2= Olson|first2= James S.|date= 1995|title= John Wayne: American|url= |location= New York|publisher= Free Press|isbn= 978-0-02-923837-0|access-date= }}</ref>{{rp|63–64}} Initially working for the [[20th Century Fox|Fox Film Corporation]], he mostly appeared in small bit parts. His first leading role came in [[Raoul Walsh]]'s lavish [[widescreen]] epic ''[[The Big Trail]]'' (1930), which led to leading roles in numerous [[B movies]] throughout the 1930s, many of them in the [[Western (genre)|western]] genre. His career rebounded in 1939, with [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' making him an instant mainstream star. Wayne would go on to star in 142 pictures.  Biographer Ronald Davis says: "John Wayne personified for millions the nation's frontier heritage. Eighty-three of his movies were Westerns, and in them he played cowboys, cavalrymen, and unconquerable loners extracted from the Republic's central creation myth."<ref>{{cite book|author=Ronald L.

Among his better-known later films are ''[[The Quiet Man]]'' (1952), in which he is an Irish-American in love with a fiery [[spinster]] played by [[Maureen O'Hara]]; ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956), in which he plays a Civil War veteran whose young niece ([[Natalie Wood]]) is abducted by a tribe of Comanches in an Indian raid;  ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959), playing a sheriff with [[Dean Martin]]; ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962), portraying a troubled rancher competing with Eastern lawyer ([[James Stewart]]) for a woman's hand in marriage; ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969), as a humorous U.S. Marshal who sets out to avenge a man's death in the role that won Wayne his Academy Award; and ''[[The Shootist]]'' (1976), his final screen performance, in which he plays an aging gunfighter battling cancer. Wayne was a prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in Hollywood, supporting [[anti-communist]] positions.<ref name="autogenerated265">[[Jim Beaver]], "John Wayne". ''Films in Review'', Volume 28, Number 5, May 1977, pp. 265–284.</ref>   In June 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] named Wayne 13th among the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|Greatest Male Screen Legends of All Time]].

Wayne's family moved to [[Palmdale, California]], and then in 1916 to [[Glendale, California]], where his father worked as a pharmacist. A local fireman at the station on his route to school in Glendale started calling him "Little Duke" because he never went anywhere without his huge [[Airedale Terrier]], Duke.<ref name="Munn">Munn, Michael (2003).

Wayne attended Wilson Middle School in Glendale. As a teen, he worked in an ice cream shop for a man who [[horseshoe|shod]] horses for Hollywood studios. He was also active as a member of the [[Order of DeMolay]], a youth organization associated with the [[Freemasons]].

While working for [[Fox Film Corporation]] in bit roles, Wayne was given on-screen credit as "Duke Morrison" only once, in ''[[Words and Music (1929 film)|Words and Music]]'' (1929). In 1930, director [[Raoul Walsh]] saw him moving studio furniture while working as a prop boy and cast him in his first starring role in ''[[The Big Trail]]'' (1930). For his screen name, Walsh suggested "Anthony Wayne", after [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general [[Anthony Wayne|"Mad" Anthony Wayne]]. The Fox Studios chief [[Winfield Sheehan]] rejected it as sounding "too Italian". Walsh then suggested "John Wayne". Sheehan agreed, and the name was set. Wayne was not even present for the discussion.<ref name=RobertsOlson1995/>{{rp|84}} His pay was raised to $105 a week.

''The Big Trail'' was to be the first big-budget outdoor spectacle of the sound era, made at a staggering cost of over $2 million, using hundreds of extras and wide vistas of the American southwest, still largely unpopulated at the time. To take advantage of the breathtaking scenery, it was filmed in two versions, a standard 35-mm version and another in the new [[70 mm Grandeur film]] process, using an innovative camera and lenses. Many in the audience who saw it in Grandeur stood and cheered. Unfortunately, only a handful of theaters were equipped to show the film in its widescreen process, and the effort was largely wasted. Despite being highly regarded by modern critics, the film was considered a huge box office flop at the time.<ref name=Clooney195>{{cite book |last1=Clooney |first1=Nick |authorlink1=Nick Clooney |title=The Movies That Changed Us: Reflections on the Screen|date=November 2002|publisher=Atria Books, a trademark of Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-7434-1043-2 |page=195}}</ref>

After the commercial failure of ''The Big Trail'', Wayne was relegated to small roles in A-pictures, including [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]'s ''[[The Deceiver (film)|The Deceiver]]'' (1931), in which he played a corpse. He appeared in the [[Serial film|serial]] ''[[The Three Musketeers (1933 serial)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1933), an updated version of the [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]] novel in which the protagonists were soldiers in the [[French Foreign Legion]] in then-contemporary North Africa. He played the lead, with his name over the title, in many low-budget "[[Poverty Row]]" westerns, mostly at [[Monogram Pictures]] and serials for [[Mascot Pictures Corporation]]. By Wayne's own estimation, he appeared in about 80 of these [[horse opera]]s from 1930 to 1939.<ref>Clooney, p. 196.</ref> In ''[[Riders of Destiny]]'' (1933), he became one of the first [[singing cowboy]]s of film, albeit via dubbing.<ref name="peterson1997">{{cite book | title=Creating Country Music: Fabricating Authenticity | author=Peterson, Richard A. | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J3zWpIOLB-MC&lpg=PA84&dq=singing%20cowboys%20john%20wayne&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=singing%20cowboys%20john%20wayne&f=false | year=1997 | publisher=University of Chicago Press | pages=84–86 | isbn=0-226-66284-5}}</ref> Wayne also appeared in some of the ''[[Three Mesquiteers]]'' westerns, whose title was a [[word play|play]] on the Dumas classic. He was mentored by [[Stunt performer|stuntmen]] in riding and other [[Western (genre)|western]] skills.<ref name=JWBio-TQL /> He and famed stuntman [[Yakima Canutt]] developed and perfected stunts and onscreen fisticuffs techniques still used today.<ref>Canutt, Yakima, with Oliver Drake, ''Stuntman''.

Wayne's breakthrough role came with director [[John Ford]]'s classic ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939). Because of Wayne's [[B-movie]] status and track record in low-budget westerns throughout the 1930s, Ford had difficulty getting financing for what was to be an A-budget film. After rejection by all the top studios, Ford struck a deal with independent producer [[Walter Wanger]] in which [[Claire Trevor]]—a much bigger star at the time—received top billing. ''Stagecoach'' was a huge critical and financial success, and Wayne became a mainstream star. Cast member Louise Platt credits Ford as saying at the time that Wayne would become the biggest star ever because of his appeal as the archetypal "everyman".<ref name="Louise Platt letter">[http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/hollywood/films/movie-stagecoach.html#platt2 Letter, Louise Platt to Ned Scott Archive, July 7, 2002] pp: 40: </ref>

America's entry into [[World War II]] resulted in a deluge of support for the war effort from all sectors of society, and Hollywood was no exception. Wayne was exempted from service due to his age (34 at the time of Pearl Harbor) and family status, classified as 3-A (family deferment). He repeatedly wrote John Ford saying he wanted to enlist, on one occasion inquiring whether he could get into Ford's military unit, but consistently kept postponing it until after "he finished just one or two pictures".<ref name=RobertsOlson1995/>{{rp|212}} Wayne did not attempt to prevent his reclassification as 1-A (draft eligible), but [[Republic Pictures|Republic Studios]] was emphatically resistant to losing him; [[Herbert J. Yates]], President of Republic, threatened Wayne with a lawsuit if he walked away from his contract,<ref name=RobertsOlson1995/>{{rp|220}} and Republic Pictures intervened in the Selective Service process, requesting Wayne's further deferment.<ref name=RobertsOlson1995/>{{rp|213}}

U.S. National Archives records indicate that Wayne had, in fact, made an application <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/press/press-kits/american-originals-traveling.html#wayne|title=Press Kits: American Originals Traveling Exhibit|date=October 25, 2010|work=archives.gov|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref> to serve in the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]], today's equivalent of the [[CIA]], and had been accepted within the U.S. Army's allotted billet to the OSS.

===Commercial success===
[[File:John Wayne in Wake of the Red Witch trailer.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Wake of the Red Witch]]'' (1948)]]

Wayne's first color film was ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills (film)|Shepherd of the Hills]]'' (1941), in which he co-starred with his longtime friend [[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]]. The following year, he appeared in his only film directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], the [[Technicolor]] epic ''[[Reap the Wild Wind]]'' (1942), in which he co-starred with [[Ray Milland]] and [[Paulette Goddard]]; it was one of the rare times he played a character with questionable values. He would appear in more than twenty of John Ford's films throughout the next two decades, including ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'' (1949), ''[[The Quiet Man]]'' (1952), ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[The Wings of Eagles]]'' (1957), and ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962) with James Stewart: the first movie in which he called someone "Pilgrim".

In 1949, director [[Robert Rossen]] offered the starring role of ''[[All the King's Men (1949 film)|All the King's Men]]'' to Wayne. Wayne refused, believing the script to be un-American in many ways.<ref name=RobertsOlson1995/> [[Broderick Crawford]], who eventually got the role, won the 1949 Oscar for best male actor, ironically beating out Wayne, who had been nominated for ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]].''

He lost the leading role in ''[[The Gunfighter]]'' (1950) to [[Gregory Peck]] due to his refusal to work for [[Columbia Pictures]] because its chief, [[Harry Cohn]], had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player. Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne's grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to [[Twentieth Century Fox]], which cast Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted but for which he refused to bend.<ref name=RobertsOlson1995/>

[[File:John Wayne - Joan Blondell - 1942.jpg|thumb|240px|With [[Joan Blondell]] in ''Lady for a Night'' (1942)]]

One of Wayne's most popular roles was in ''[[The High and the Mighty (film)|The High and the Mighty]]'' (1954), directed by [[William Wellman]], and based on a novel by [[Ernest K. Gann]]. His portrayal of a heroic copilot won widespread acclaim. Wayne also portrayed aviators in ''[[Flying Tigers (film)|Flying Tigers]] (1942),'' ''[[Flying Leathernecks]]'' (1951), ''[[Island in the Sky (1953 film)|Island in the Sky]]'' (1953), ''[[The Wings of Eagles]]'' (1957), and ''[[Jet Pilot (1957 film)|Jet Pilot]]'' (1957).

''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956) continues to be widely regarded as arguably Wayne's finest and most complex performance. In 2006, ''Premiere Magazine'' ran an industry poll in which Wayne's portrayal of Ethan Edwards was rated the 87th greatest performance in film history. He named his youngest son Ethan after the character.

===Later career===
John Wayne won a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969). This came 17 years after his only other nomination. Wayne was also nominated as the producer of [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] for ''[[The Alamo (1960 film)|The Alamo]]'' (1960), one of two films he directed. The other was ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' (1968), the only major film made during the [[Vietnam War]] to support the war.<ref name=jwayne.com /> During the filming of ''Green Berets'', the [[Degar]] or Montagnard people of Vietnam's Central Highlands, fierce fighters against communism, bestowed on Wayne a brass bracelet that he wore in the film and all subsequent films.<ref name=RobertsOlson1995/>
[[File:Waynemuldaurmcq.jpg|left|thumb|In ''[[McQ]]'', with co-star [[Diana Muldaur]] (1974)]]

In an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of ''[[Dirty Harry]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Wayne took on the role of gritty detective ''[[McQ]]'' in the 1974 crime drama. His last film was ''[[The Shootist]]'' (1976), whose main character, J. B. Books, was dying of cancer—the illness to which Wayne himself succumbed three years later. According to the [[Internet Movie Database]], Wayne played the lead in 142 of his film appearances.

[[Batjac Productions|Batjac]], the production company co-founded by Wayne, was named after the fictional shipping company Batjak in ''[[Wake of the Red Witch]]'' (1948), a film based on the novel by [[Garland Roark]]. (A spelling error by Wayne's secretary was allowed to stand, accounting for the variation.)<ref name=RobertsOlson1995/> Batjac (and its predecessor, Wayne-Fellows Productions) was the arm through which Wayne produced many films for himself and other stars. Its best-known non-Wayne production was ''[[Seven Men From Now]]'' (1956), which started the classic collaboration between director [[Budd Boetticher]] and star [[Randolph Scott]].

In the ''Motion Picture Herald'' Top Ten Money-Making Western Stars poll, Wayne was listed in 1936 and 1939.<ref>Phil Hardy ''The Encyclopedia of Western Movies'', [[Octopus|London]], Octopus, 1985, ISBN 0-7064-2555-3</ref> He appeared in the similar ''Box Office'' poll in 1939 and 1940.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chuck Anderson |url=http://www.b-westerns.com/terms5.htm |title=Motion Picture Herald and Boxoffice Polls |publisher=B-westerns.com |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> While these two polls are really an indication only of the popularity of series stars, Wayne also appeared in the ''Top Ten Money Makers Poll'' of all films from 1949 to 1957 and 1958 to 1974, taking first place in 1950, 1951, 1954 and 1971. With a total of 25 years on the list, Wayne has more appearances than any other star, beating Clint Eastwood (21) into second place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html|title=Top Ten Money Making Stars - Poll Results|work=quigleypublishing.com|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>

[[File:John wayne challenge of ideas screenshot 2.jpg|thumb|Wayne in ''The Challenge of Ideas'' (1961)]]

In later years, Wayne was recognized as a sort of American natural resource, and his various critics, of his performances and his politics, viewed him with more respect. [[Abbie Hoffman]], the radical of the 1960s, paid tribute to Wayne's singularity, saying, "I like Wayne's wholeness, his style. As for his politics, well—I suppose even cavemen felt a little admiration for the dinosaurs that were trying to gobble them up."<ref>Time magazine, August 8, 1969.</ref> Reviewing ''[[The Cowboys]]'' (1972), [[Vincent Canby]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'', who did not particularly care for the film, wrote: "Wayne is, of course, marvelously indestructible, and he has become an almost perfect father figure."

==Personal life==
Wayne was married three times and divorced twice. He was fluent in Spanish and his three wives, each of [[Hispanic]] descent, were [[Josephine Wayne|Josephine Alicia Saenz]], [[Esperanza Baur]], and [[Pilar Pallete]]. He had four children with Josephine: [[Michael Wayne]] (November 23, 1934&nbsp;– April 2, 2003), Mary Antonia "Toni" Wayne LaCava (February 25, 1936 – December 6, 2000), [[Patrick Wayne]] (born July 15, 1939), and Melinda Wayne Munoz (born December 3, 1940). He had three more children with Pilar: Aissa Wayne (born March 31, 1956), [[Ethan Wayne|John Ethan Wayne]] (born February 22, 1962), and Marisa Wayne (born February 22, 1966).

Several of Wayne's children entered the film and television industry; Wayne's son Ethan was billed as John Ethan Wayne in a few films, and played one of the leads in the 1990s update of the ''[[Adam-12 (1990 TV series)|Adam-12]]'' television series.

His stormiest divorce was from Esperanza Baur, a former Mexican actress. She convinced herself that Wayne and co-star [[Gail Russell]] were having an affair, a claim which both Wayne and Russell denied. The night the film ''[[Angel and the Badman]]'' (1947) wrapped, there was the usual party for cast and crew, and Wayne came home very late. Esperanza was in a drunken rage by the time he arrived, and she attempted to shoot him as he walked through the front door.<ref name=RobertsOlson1995/>

Wayne had several high-profile affairs, including one with [[Marlene Dietrich]] that lasted for three years and one with [[Merle Oberon]] that lasted from 1938 to 1947.<ref name=RobertsOlson1995/>{{rp|195–197}} After his separation from his wife, Pilar, in 1973, Wayne became romantically involved and lived with his former secretary Pat Stacy (1941–1995) until his death in 1979.<ref name=jwayne.com /> She published a biography of her life with him in 1983, titled ''Duke: A Love Story''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/duke-a-love-story-an-intimate-memoir-of-john-waynes-last-years/oclc/9082896|title=Duke: a love story: an intimate memoir of John Wayne's last years|publisher=[[WorldCat]]|accessdate=December 12, 2011}}</ref>

A close friend of Wayne's, California [[Alphonzo E. Bell, Jr.|Congressman Alphonzo Bell]], wrote of him, "Duke's personality and sense of humor were very close to what the general public saw on the big screen. It is perhaps best shown in these words he had engraved on a plaque: 'Each of us is a mixture of some good and some not so good qualities.

Wayne supported Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1960|presidential election of 1960]], but expressed his vision of patriotism when [[John F.

Due to his enormous popularity and his status as the most famous Republican star in Hollywood, wealthy [[Texas]] Republican Party backers asked Wayne to run for national office in 1968, as had his friend and fellow actor Senator [[George Murphy]]. He declined, joking that he did not believe the public would seriously consider an actor in the [[White House]]. Instead, he supported his friend [[Ronald Reagan]]'s runs for [[Governor of California]] in 1966 and 1970.

In May 1971, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine published an interview with Wayne which resulted in a firestorm of controversy.

In the same ''Playboy'' interview, Wayne also responded to questions about whether entitlement programs including [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] were good for the country:
{{quote|I know all about that. In the late Twenties, when I was a sophomore at USC, I was a socialist myself—but not when I left.

===Awards, celebrations, and landmarks===
John Wayne's enduring status as an iconic American was formally recognized by the U.S. government by awarding him the two highest civilian decorations. He was recognized by the [[United States Congress]] on May 26, 1979, when he was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]]. Hollywood figures and American leaders from across the political spectrum, including [[Maureen O'Hara]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Mike Frankovich]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], General and Mrs. [[Omar Bradley]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Robert Stack]], [[James Arness]], and [[Kirk Douglas]], testified to Congress of the merit and deservedness of this award. Most notable was the testimony of [[Robert Aldrich]], then president of the [[Directors Guild of America]], who said:

{{quote|It is important for you to know that I am a registered Democrat and, to my knowledge, share none of the political views espoused by Duke. However, whether he is ill disposed or healthy, John Wayne is far beyond the normal political sharpshooting in this community. Because of his courage, his dignity, his integrity, and because of his talents as an actor, his strength as a leader, his warmth as a human being throughout his illustrious career, he is entitled to a unique spot in our hearts and minds. In this industry, we often judge people, sometimes unfairly, by asking whether they have paid their dues. John Wayne has paid his dues over and over, and I'm proud to consider him a friend and am very much in favor of my government recognizing in some important fashion the contribution that Mr. Wayne has made.<ref name="rutherford">{{cite web|last=Whitehead |first=John W. |title=John Wayne Was True Grit |work=The Rutherford Institute |date=June 6, 2011 |url=https://www.rutherford.org/publications_resources/john_whiteheads_commentary/john_wayne_was_true_grit |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref>

On June 9, 1980, Wayne was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Jimmy Carter]], at whose inaugural ball Wayne had appeared "as a member of the loyal opposition", as Wayne described it in his speech to the gathering.

In 1998, Wayne was posthumously awarded the Naval Heritage Award by the US Navy Memorial Foundation for his support of the Navy and military during his film career.

Various public locations are named in honor of Wayne, including the [[John Wayne Airport]] in [[Orange County, California]], where a nine-foot bronze statue of him stands at the entrance; the John Wayne Marina<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portofpa.com/marinas/john-wayne-marina.html |title=John Wayne Marina |publisher=Portofpa.com |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref> for which Wayne bequeathed the land, near [[Sequim, Washington]]; [[John Wayne Elementary School]] ([[P.S. 380]]) in [[Brooklyn]], New York, which boasts a 38-foot [[mosaic]] mural commission by New York artist [[Knox Martin]]<ref>{{cite web|author=www.esensedesigns.com |url=http://www.knoxmartin.com/exhibitions.html |title=Exhibitions |publisher=Knoxmartin.com |date=September 21, 2008 |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref> entitled "John Wayne and the American Frontier";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/community/facilities/PublicArt/Art/artitem.htm?ac=314&an=20056 |title=John Wayne, Knox Martin&nbsp;— Public Art for Public Schools |publisher=Schools.nyc.gov |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref> and a 100-plus-mile trail named the "John Wayne Pioneer Trail" in Washington's [[Iron Horse State Park]]. A larger than life-size bronze statue of Wayne atop a horse was erected at the corner of La Cienega Boulevard and Wilshire Boulevard in [[Beverly Hills, California]], at the former offices of the Great Western Savings and Loan Corporation, for which Wayne had made a number of commercials. In the city of [[Maricopa, Arizona]], part of [[Arizona State Route 347]] is named John Wayne Parkway, which runs through the center of town.

In 2006, friends of Wayne's and his former Arizona business partner, Louis Johnson, inaugurated the "Louie and the Duke Classics" events benefiting the John Wayne Cancer Foundation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jwcf.org/ |title=John Wayne Cancer Foundation |publisher=Jwcf.org |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref> and the [[American Cancer Society]].<ref name=OlsonJ-GL-2006-10>Olson, Jim.&nbsp;— [http://maricopagrande.com/files/JimOlsonStoryOct.pdf "Louie and the Duke Classics 2006"].&nbsp;— ''Grande Living''.&nbsp;— October 2006.&nbsp;— (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jwcf.org/news/2006.html |title=News and Events: 2006 Archive |publisher=Jwcf.org |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref> The weekend-long event each fall in [[Casa Grande, Arizona]], includes a golf tournament, an auction of John Wayne memorabilia, and a [[team roping]] competition.<ref name=OlsonJ-GL-2006-10 />

A celebration at the John Wayne birthplace in Winterset, Iowa, included chuck-wagon suppers, concerts by [[Michael Martin Murphey]] and [[Riders in the Sky (band)|Riders in the Sky]], a Wild West Revue in the style of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, and a Cowboy Symposium with Wayne's co-stars, producers, and costumer. Wayne's films ran repetitively at the local theater. Ground was broken for the New John Wayne Birthplace Museum and Learning Center at a ceremony consisting of over 30 of Wayne's family members, including Melinda Wayne Muñoz, Aissa, Ethan, and Marisa Wayne. Later that year, California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and First Lady [[Maria Shriver]] inducted Wayne into the [[California Hall of Fame]], located at [[The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts]].<ref>[http://www.californiamuseum.org/Exhibits/Hall-of-Fame/inductees.html Wayne inducted into California Hall of Fame], California Museum.

===Cultural image as an American icon===
[[File:Lucille Ball John Wayne 1955.JPG|thumb|With [[Lucille Ball]] in ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', 1955]]

Wayne rose beyond the typical recognition for a famous actor to that of an enduring icon who symbolized and communicated American values and ideals. By the middle of his career, Wayne had developed a larger-than-life image, and as his career progressed, he selected roles that would not compromise his off-screen image. By the time of his last film ''The Shootist'' (1976), Wayne refused to allow his character to shoot a man in the back as was originally scripted,<ref>[http://imdb.com/title/tt0075213/trivia Trivia]&nbsp;— ''The Shootist'' (1976)&nbsp;— [[IMDb]].</ref> saying "I've made over 250 pictures and have never shot a guy in the back. Change it."

Wayne's rise to being the quintessential movie war hero began to take shape four years after World War II, when ''Sands of Iwo Jima'' (1949) was released. His footprints at Grauman's Chinese theater in Hollywood were laid in concrete that contained sand from [[Iwo Jima]].<ref>Endres, Stacey and Robert Cushman. Hollywood at Your Feet. Beverly Hills: Pomegranate Press, 1993 ISBN 0-938817-08-6.</ref> His status grew so large and legendary that when Japanese [[Emperor Hirohito]] visited the United States in 1975, he asked to meet John Wayne, the symbolic representation of his country's former enemy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946563,00.html |title=The Nation: Hirohito Winds Up His Grand U.S. Tour |publisher=Time.com |date=October 20, 1975 |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}</ref>

Wayne is the only actor to appear in every edition of the annual [[Harris Poll]] of Most Popular Film Actors, and the only actor to appear on the list after his death. Wayne has been in the top ten in this poll for 19 consecutive years, starting in 1994, 15 years after his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/NewsRoom/HarrisPolls/tabid/447/mid/1508/articleId/1141/ctl/ReadCustom%20Default/Default.aspx|title=Denzel Washington Flies to Number One and is America's Favorite Movie Star |publisher=Harris Interactive |date=January 23, 2013 |accessdate=October 2, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:John Wayne in The Longest Day trailer.jpg|thumb|left|In ''The Longest Day'', 1962]]
[[Newport Beach, California]]-based John Wayne Enterprises sells products such as Kentucky straight [[Bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] using Wayne's picture. When the company tried to [[trademark]] the image appearing on one of the bottles, [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]] filed a notice of opposition. According to court documents, Duke has tried three times since 2005 to stop the company from trademarking the name. The company wants a federal judge in Orange County, California, to declare that both brands can be allowed. The company's complaint filed in federal court says the university "does not own the word 'Duke' in all contexts for all purposes."<ref name=Times/> The university's official position is not to object if Wayne's image is used, but if the company wants to use the Duke name without Wayne, the university says, "we are also committed to protecting the integrity of Duke University's trademarks."<ref name=Times/> Richard Howell, an attorney for John Wayne Enterprises, said the company supports a co-use agreement, though he believed the name "Duke" would be more likely associated with Wayne than with the university.<ref name=Times>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-duke-on-duke-20140711-story.html |title=John Wayne heirs Duke it out with university |last=Cowan |first=Jill |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 11, 2014 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

==Filmography==
{{Main|John Wayne filmography}}

Between 1926 and 1976, Wayne appeared in over 170 motion pictures, and became one of America's biggest box office stars.  Only [[Clark Gable]] sold more tickets than Wayne, although the ticket prices were not commensurate since, although both actors started their careers at the same time, Gable's career height preceded Wayne's by approximately fifteen years.

==Missed roles==
*In 1948 Wayne was offered the role of Jimmy Ringo in ''[[The Gunfighter]]'', a script that [[Columbia Pictures]] had purchased for that specific purpose. Wayne turned it down, despite having expressed a strong desire to play the part, because of his longstanding hatred for Columbia's president, [[Harry Cohn]].  Columbia sold the rights to [[Twentieth Century Fox]], where the role went to [[Gregory Peck]].   Wayne's final film, ''[[The Shootist]]'' (1976), is often compared to ''The Gunfighter'' and contains numerous plot similarities.<ref name=RobertsOlson1995/><ref>Hyams, J. ''The Life and Times of the Western Movie.'' Gallery Books (1984), pp. 109-12. ISBN 0831755458</ref>
*Wayne was offered the lead role in the 1952 film ''[[High Noon]]'', but turned it down because he felt the film's story was an allegory for blacklisting, which he actively supported. In his ''Playboy'' interview from May 1971, Wayne stated he considered ''High Noon'' "the most un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life" and that he would "never regret having helped run" [[Carl Foreman]] (who wrote the screenplay) "out of the country".<ref name=davis/>{{rp|142}}
*An urban legend has it that Wayne was offered the leading role of Matt Dillon in the longtime television show ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', but he turned it down, recommending [[James Arness]] for the role instead. The only part of this story that is true is that Wayne recommended Arness for the part. Wayne was arguably the industry's top film star at the time and would not have considered a television series.  Wayne introduced Arness in an on-camera prologue to the first episode of ''Gunsmoke''.<ref>[http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/gunsmok2.htm ''Gunsmoke'']&nbsp;— Snopes.com, August 6, 2007.</ref>
*Wayne was offered a cameo role by [[Mel Brooks]] in the film ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''.  After reading the script Wayne declined, fearing the dialogue was "too dirty" for his family image, but told Brooks that he would be "first in line" to see the film.<ref>Interview: [[Mel Brooks]]. ''Blazing Saddles'' (DVD). Burbank, California: Warner Brothers Pictures/Warner Home Video, 2004. ISBN 0-7907-5735-4.</ref> 
*He reportedly had initially strongly considered taking the role of Major Reisman in ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'', even asking [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to make changes to the script to accommodate him, but ultimately, he turned it down to make ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The role went to [[Lee Marvin]].
*Wayne had lobbied to play the lead in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', but [[Warner Bros.]] felt that at age 63, he was too old for the role.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The role eventually went to [[Clint Eastwood]].

=== Golden Globe ===
The Golden Globe Awards are presented annually by the [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] (HFPA) to recognize outstanding achievements in the entertainment industry, both domestic and foreign, and to focus wide public attention upon the best in motion pictures and television. In 1953, Wayne was awarded the Henrietta Award (a now retired award) for being World Film Favorite: Male.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000078/awards John Wayne (I) – Awards]</ref>

The [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] for lifetime achievement in motion pictures is an annual award given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association at the Golden Globe Award ceremonies in Hollywood. It was named in honor of Cecil B. DeMille (1881–1959), one of the industry's most successful filmmakers; John Wayne won the award in 1966.<ref name="gg-cecil">{{cite web|title=The Cecil B. DeMille Award |publisher=''Hollywood Foreign Press Association'' |url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/cecil60/ |accessdate=October 26, 2012}}</ref>

In 1970, Wayne won a Golden Globe Award for his performance in ''True Grit''.

=== Brass Balls Award ===
In 1973, ''[[The Harvard Lampoon]]'', a satirical paper run by [[Harvard University]] students, invited Wayne to receive The Brass Balls Award, created in his "honor", after calling him "the biggest fraud in history". [[Harvard Square]] had become a hot bed of leftist intellectualism and protest throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Wayne accepted the invitation as a chance to promote the recently released film ''McQ'', and a [[Fort Devens]] Army convoy offered to drive him into the square on an [[armored personnel carrier]].<ref name=BryanTimes /><ref name="harvard">{{cite book|last=Lotman|first=Mo|title=Harvard Square: An Illustrated History Since 1950|year=2009|publisher=Stewart, Tabori & Chang|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58479-747-0|page=95}}</ref> The ceremony was held on January 15, 1974, at the Harvard Square Theater and the award was officially presented in honor of Wayne's "outstanding machismo and penchant for punching people".<ref>{{cite web|last=Zegarac|first=Nick|title=John Wayne – American|url=http://thehollywoodart.blogspot.com/2006/11/john-wayne-american.html|work=The Hollywood Art|accessdate=June 24, 2013}}</ref> Although the convoy was met with protests by members of the [[American Indian Movement]] and others, some of whom threw snowballs, Wayne received a standing ovation from the audience when he walked onto the stage.<ref name=BryanTimes>{{cite news|last=Reed|first=Phillip, Jr.|title=John Wayne handles Harvard challenge well|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&dat=19740116&id=LrhaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JFMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1039,904103|accessdate=June 24, 2013|newspaper=The Bryan Times|date=January 16, 1974}}</ref> An internal investigation was launched into the Army's involvement in the day.<ref name="harvard" />
