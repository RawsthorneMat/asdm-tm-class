Salmi turned down the offer because he did not enjoy film work. ([[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]] was later cast as Bo and earned an [[Academy Award]] nomination for his performance.)<ref name=pettit>{{cite web|last=Pettit|first=Stefanie|title=Landmarks: Actor’s murder-suicide left behind fame, forgiveness|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2011/feb/17/landmarks-actors-murder-suicide-left-behind-fame/|publisher=spokesman.com|date=February 17, 2011}}</ref> Salmi turned down several other offers to make films before he finally accepted a role as Smerdjakov in the 1958 film ''[[The Brothers Karamazov (1958 film)|The Brothers Karamazov]]'', with [[Yul Brynner]], [[Lee J.
