'''Robert Charles Durman Mitchum''' (August 6, 1917&nbsp;– July 1, 1997) was an American film actor, author, composer and singer. Mitchum rose to prominence for his starring roles in several classic [[film noir|films noir]], and is generally considered a forerunner of the [[anti-heroes]] prevalent in film during the 1950s and 1960s. His best-known films include ''[[The Story of G.I. Joe]]'' (1945), ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' (1947), ''[[Out of the Past]]'' (1947), ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955), ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'' (1962), and ''[[El Dorado (1966 film)|El Dorado]]'' (1966).

Mitchum is rated #23 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|list of the 50 greatest American screen legends of all time]] (25 greatest males/25 greatest females).<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/afilegends.html "Greatest Film Legends."] ''filmsite.org''.

==Early years==
Mitchum was born in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] into a [[Methodist]] family.<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/people/pm/Robert_Mitchum.html "The religious affiliation of Robert Mitchum: Great American actor."] ''Famous Methodists'', June 24, 2005.</ref> His mother, Ann Harriet Mitchum (née Gunderson), was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] immigrant and sea captain's daughter, and his father, James Thomas Mitchum, was of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Ulster]] descent<ref>Vacha, Lil.

: March 20, 2015.</ref> and was a shipyard and railroad worker.<ref name="server"/> A sister, Annette, (known as [[Julie Mitchum]] during her acting career) was born in 1914. James Mitchum was crushed to death in a [[railyard]] accident in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], in February 1919, when his son was less than two years old. After his father's death, his mother was awarded a government [[pension]], and soon realized she was pregnant with her second son, [[John Mitchum|John]], who was born in September. She remarried to a former [[Royal Naval Reserve]] officer, Lieutenant Hugh Cunningham Morris RNVR, who helped her care for the children. Ann and the Major had a daughter, Carol Morris, who was born July 1927 on the family farm in [[Delaware]]. When all of the children were old enough to attend school, Ann found employment as a [[linotype machine|linotype]] operator for the ''Bridgeport Post''.<ref name="server">[[Lee Server|Server]] 2001,  pp. 3–8.</ref>

Throughout Mitchum's childhood, he was known as a prankster, often involved in fistfights and mischief. When he was 12, his mother sent Mitchum to live with his grandparents in [[Felton, Delaware]], where he was promptly expelled from his middle school for scuffling with a principal. A year later, in 1930, he moved in with his older sister, in [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]]. After being expelled from Haaran High School, he left his sister and traveled throughout the country on railroad cars, taking a number of jobs including ditch-digging for the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and professional boxing. He experienced numerous adventures during his years as one of the Depression era's "wild boys of the road." At age 14 in [[Savannah, Georgia]], he was arrested for vagrancy and put on a local [[chain gang]]. By Mitchum's own account, he escaped and returned to his family in Delaware. It was during this time, while recovering from injuries that nearly cost him a leg, that he met the woman he would marry, a teenaged Dorothy Spence. He soon went back on the road, eventually riding the rails to [[California]]. <ref name="Biography">[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/133126%7C132297/Robert-Mitchum/ "Biography: Robert Mitchum."] ''Turner Classic Movies''.  Retrieved: March 20, 2015.</ref>

==Acting career==
Mitchum arrived in [[Long Beach, California]], in 1936, staying again with his sister Julie. Soon the rest of the Mitchum family joined them in Long Beach. During this time he worked as a [[ghostwriter]] for [[astrology|astrologer]] [[Carroll Righter]]. It was sister Julie who convinced him to join the local theater guild with her. In his years with the Players Guild of Long Beach, he made a living as a stagehand and occasional bit-player in company productions. He also wrote several short pieces which were performed by the guild. According to [[Lee Server]]'s biography (''Robert Mitchum: Baby, I Don't Care''), Mitchum put his talent for poetry to work writing song lyrics and monologues for his sister Julie's nightclub performances. In 1940 he returned East to marry Dorothy Spence, taking her back to California. He remained a footloose character until the birth of their first child, [[James Mitchum]], nicknamed Josh (two more children would follow, [[Christopher Mitchum]] and Petrine). Mitchum then got a steady job as a machine operator with the [[Lockheed Aircraft Corporation]].<ref name="Biography"/>

A nervous breakdown (which resulted in temporary blindness), apparently from job-related stress, led Mitchum to look for work as an actor or extra in movies. An agent he had met got him an interview with the producer of the ''[[Hopalong Cassidy]]'' series of [[B-movie|B-westerns]]; he was hired to play the villain in several films in the series during 1942 and 1943. He continued to find further work as an extra and supporting actor in numerous productions for various studios. After impressing director [[Mervyn LeRoy]] during the making of ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]],'' Mitchum signed a seven-year contract with [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. He found himself groomed for B Western stardom in a series of [[Zane Grey]] adaptations. <ref name="Biography"/>

Following the moderately successful western ''[[Nevada (1944 film)|Nevada]]'', Mitchum was lent from RKO to United Artists for the [[William Wellman]]-helmed ''[[The Story of G.I. Joe]]''. In the film, he portrayed war-weary officer Bill Walker (based on Captain [[Henry T. Waskow]]), who remains resolute despite the troubles he faces. The film, which followed the life of an ordinary soldier through the eyes of journalist [[Ernie Pyle]] (played by [[Burgess Meredith]]), became an instant critical and commercial success. Shortly after making the film, Mitchum himself was drafted into the [[United States Army]], serving at [[Fort MacArthur]], California. At the 1946 [[Academy Awards]], ''The Story of G.I. Joe'' was nominated for four Oscars, including Mitchum's only nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. He finished the year off with a western (''West of the Pecos'') and a story of returning Marine [[veteran]]s (''Till the End of Time''), before filming in a genre that came to define Mitchum's career and screen persona: film noir.

===Film noir===
Mitchum was initially known for his work in [[film noir]]. His first foray into the genre was a supporting role in the [[B-movie|B-film]] ''[[When Strangers Marry]]'', about newlyweds and a New York City [[serial killer]]. ''[[Undercurrent (1946 film)|Undercurrent]]'', another of Mitchum's early noirs, featured him playing against type as a troubled, sensitive man entangled in the affairs of his brother ([[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]]) and his brother's suspicious wife ([[Katharine Hepburn]]). [[John Brahm]]'s ''[[The Locket]]'' (1946) featured Mitchum as bitter ex-husband to [[Laraine Day]]'s [[femme fatale]]. [[Raoul Walsh]]'s ''[[Pursued]]'' (1947) combined [[western movie|western]] and [[film noir|noir]] styles, with Mitchum's character attempting to recall his past and find those responsible for killing his family. ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' (also 1947) featured Mitchum as a member of a group of soldiers, one of whom kills a Jewish man in an act of anti-Jewish hatred. It featured themes of [[anti-Semitism]] and the failings of military training. The film, directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]], earned five [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations. <ref name="Biography"/>

[[File:OutOfThePastMitchumGreer.jpg|thumb|Mitchum's famous role in ''[[Out of the Past]]'' (1947)'']]
Following ''Crossfire,'' Mitchum starred in ''[[Out of the Past]]'' (also called ''Build My Gallows High''), directed by [[Jacques Tourneur]] and featuring the cinematography of [[Nicholas Musuraca]]. Mitchum played Jeff Markham, a small-town gas station owner whose unfinished business with gambler Whit Sterling ([[Kirk Douglas]]) and [[femme fatale]] Kathie Moffett ([[Jane Greer]]), comes back to haunt him.

On September 1, 1948, after a string of successful films for RKO, Mitchum and actress [[Lila Leeds]] were arrested for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-QtPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EE8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=1737,716525&dq=marijuana&hl=en  "Robert Mitch arrested with two actresses in marijuana raid."] ''St. Petersburg Times,'' September 2, 1948.</ref> The arrest was the result of a [[sting operation]] designed to capture other Hollywood partiers as well, but Mitchum and Leeds did not receive the tipoff. After serving a week at the county jail, (he described the experience to a reporter as being "like Palm Springs, but without the riff-raff") Mitchum spent 43 days (February 16 to March 30) at a [[Castaic, California]] [[prison farm]], with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine photographers right there taking photos of him mopping up in his prison uniform.<ref>[http://home.sprintmail.com/~sknolle/mitchum/images/Bobjail.JPG "Mitchum images."] "sprintmail.com''. Retrieved: October 10, 2012.</ref> The arrest became the inspiration for the exploitation film ''[[She Shoulda Said No!]]'' (1949), which starred Leeds.<ref>Mitchum's upcoming film, ''[[Rachel and the Stranger]]'', was rushed to completion to take advantage of the publicity surrounding the arrest. {{AFI film|25688|Rachel and the Stranger}}</ref> The conviction was later overturned by the Los Angeles court and District Attorney's office on January 31, 1951, with the following statement, after it was exposed as a setup:{{cquote|After an exhaustive investigation of the evidence and testimony presented at the trial, the court orders that the verdict of guilty be set aside and that a plea of not guilty be entered and that the information or complaint be dismissed.}}[In a segment of TCM's Private Screenings, Mitchum tells host Robert Osborne that his arrest in the marijuana raid "never happened," that it was completely staged by the movie studio's publicity department. This claim left Osborne visibly stunned.] 

Whether despite, or because of, his troubles with the law and his studio, the films released immediately after his arrest were box-office hits. ''[[Rachel and the Stranger]]'' (1948) featured Mitchum in a supporting role as a mountain man competing for the hand of [[Loretta Young]], the indentured servant and wife of [[William Holden]], while he appeared in the film adaptation of [[John Steinbeck]]'s novella ''[[The Red Pony]]'' (1949) as a trusted cowhand to a ranching family. He returned to true ''film noir'' in ''[[The Big Steal]]'' (also 1949), where he again joined Jane Greer in an early [[Don Siegel]] film.

===Career in the 1950s and 1960s===
[[File:Robert Mitchum Jane Russell His Kind of Woman 1951.jpg|right|thumb|With [[Jane Russell]] in ''[[His Kind of Woman]]'' (1951)]]
In ''[[Where Danger Lives]]'' (1950), Mitchum played a doctor who comes between a mentally unbalanced [[Faith Domergue]] and cuckolded [[Claude Rains]]. ''[[The Racket (1951 film)|The Racket]]'' was a noir [[remake]] of the early crime drama [[The Racket (1928 film)|of the same name]] and featured Mitchum as a police captain fighting corruption in his precinct. The [[Josef von Sternberg]] film ''[[Macao (film)|Macao]]'' (1952) saw Mitchum a victim of mistaken identity at an exotic resort casino, playing opposite [[Jane Russell]]. [[Otto Preminger]]'s ''[[Angel Face (1952 film)|Angel Face]]'' was the first of three collaborations between Mitchum and [[England|British]] stage actress [[Jean Simmons]], in which she plays an insane heiress who plans to use young ambulance driver Mitchum to kill for her.

Mitchum was expelled from ''[[Blood Alley]]'' (1955), purportedly due to his conduct, especially his reportedly having thrown the film's transportation manager into [[San Francisco Bay]]. According to [[Sam O'Steen]]'s memoir, ''Cut to the Chase'', Mitchum showed up on-set after a night of drinking and tore apart a studio office when they didn't have a car ready for him. Mitchum walked off the set of the third day of filming ''Blood Alley'', claiming he could not work with the director. Because Mitchum was showing up late and behaving erratically, producer [[John Wayne]], after failing to obtain [[Humphrey Bogart]] as a replacement, took over the role himself.<ref name="osteen">[[Sam O'Steen|O'Steen]] 2002, p. 11.</ref><ref name="olsonroberts">Olson and Roberts 1997, p. 417.</ref>

Following a series of conventional westerns and films noir, as well as the [[Marilyn Monroe]] vehicle ''[[River of No Return]]'' (1954), he appeared in [[Charles Laughton]]'s only film as director, ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955). Based on a novel by [[Davis Grubb]], the thriller starred Mitchum as a monstrous criminal posing as a preacher to find money hidden by his cellmate in the cellmate's home. His performance as [[Reverend Harry Powell]] is considered by many to be one of the best of his career.<ref>Ramon, Alexander.

The film starred Mitchum against type, as an idealistic young doctor, who marries an older nurse ([[Olivia de Havilland]]), only to question his morality many years later. However, the film was not well received, with most critics pointing out that Mitchum, [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Lee Marvin]] were all too old for their characters. Olivia de Havilland received top billing over Mitchum and Sinatra.

On March 8, 1955 Mitchum formed DRM (Dorothy and Robert Mitchum) Productions to produce five films for [[United Artists]] though only four films were produced.<ref name="jerryroberts">Roberts 2000, p. 208.</ref> The first film was ''[[Bandido (1956 film)|Bandido]]'' (1956). Following a succession of average westerns and the poorly received ''[[Foreign Intrigue (film)|Foreign Intrigue]]'' (1956), Mitchum starred in the first of three films with [[Deborah Kerr]]. The [[John Huston]] war drama ''[[Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison]]'', starred Mitchum as a Marine corporal shipwrecked on a Pacific Island with a nun, Sister Angela (Deborah Kerr), being his sole companion. In this character-study, they struggle to resist the elements and the invading [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] army. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, including Best Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay. For his role, Mitchum was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]] for Best Foreign Actor. In the WWII submarine classic ''[[The Enemy Below]]'' (1956), Mitchum gave a strong performance as U.S. Naval Lieutenant Commander Murrell, the captain of a U.S. Navy Destroyer who matches wits with a German U-Boat captain [[Curt Jurgens]], who ironically would star with Mitchum again in the legendary 1962 movie ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]''. The film won an Oscar for Special Effects. <ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=81774&category=Awards "Awards: 'The Longest Day' (1962)."] ''Turner Classic Movies''.  Retrieved: March 20, 2015.</ref>

''[[Thunder Road (film)|Thunder Road]]'' (1958), the second DRM Production was loosely based on an incident in which a driver transporting moonshine was said to have crashed to his death on [[Kingston Pike]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], somewhere between Bearden Hill and Morrell Road. According to Metro Pulse writer Jack Renfro, the incident occurred in 1952 and may have been witnessed by [[James Agee]], who passed the story on to Mitchum – who not only starred in the movie, but also produced the film, co-wrote the screenplay, and is rumored to have directed much of the film himself. Mitchum also co-wrote (with [[Don Raye]]) the theme song, "The Ballad of Thunder Road". He returned to Mexico for ''[[The Wonderful Country (film)|The Wonderful Country]]'' (1959) and Ireland for ''[[A Terrible Beauty (film)|A Terrible Beauty]]''/''The Night Fighters'' for the last of his DRM Productions. <ref>[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/161075%7C0/The-Night-Fighters.html "The Noght Fighters".] ''Turner Classic Movies''.  Retrieved: March 20, 2015.</ref>
[[File:Robert Mitchum.jpg|thumb|left|In ''[[The Sundowners]]'' (1960)]]
Mitchum and Kerr reunited for the [[Fred Zinnemann]] film, ''[[The Sundowners]]'' (1960), where they played husband and wife struggling in [[The Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[Australia]]. Opposite Mitchum, Kerr was nominated for yet another Academy Award for Best Actress, while the film was nominated for a total of five Oscars. Robert Mitchum was awarded that year's [[National Board of Review]] award for Best Actor for his performance. The award also recognized his superior performance in the Vincente Minnelli western drama ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (also 1960). He was teamed with former leading ladies Kerr and Simmons, as well as [[Cary Grant]], for the [[Stanley Donen]] comedy ''[[The Grass Is Greener]]'' the same year.

[[Image:Robertmitchum.JPG|right|thumb|Mitchum as [[Max Cady]] in ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'' (1962)]]
Mitchum's performance as the menacingly vengeful rapist [[Max Cady]] in ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'' (1962) brought him even more attention and furthered his renown as playing cool, predatory characters. The 1960s were marked by a number of lesser films and missed opportunities. Among the films Mitchum passed on during the decade was [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Misfits (film)|The Misfits]]'', the last film of its stars [[Clark Gable]] and Marilyn Monroe, the Academy Award–winning ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', and ''[[Dirty Harry]]''. The most notable of his films in the decade included the war epics ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962) and ''[[Anzio (film)|Anzio]]'' (1968), the [[Shirley MacLaine]] comedy-[[musical film|musical]] ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'' (1964), and the [[Howard Hawks]] western ''[[El Dorado (1966 film)|El Dorado]]'' (1966), a remake of ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959), in which Mitchum took over [[Dean Martin]]'s role of the drunk who comes to the aid of [[John Wayne]]. <ref name="Biography"/>

==Music career==
[[File:MitchumCalypso.jpg|thumb|left|Album cover of Mitchum's calypso record, ''Calypso&nbsp;— is like so...'']]
One of the lesser-known aspects of Mitchum's career were his forays into music, both as singer and composer. Critic Greg Adams writes that "Unlike most celebrity vocalists, Robert Mitchum actually had musical talent."<ref>Adams, Greg. [http://www.allmusic.com/album/that-man-robert-mitchum-sings-mw0000645835 "Robert Mitchum: That Man, Robert Mitchum, Sings."] ''allmusic.com''. Retrieved: March 20, 2015.</ref> Mitchum's voice was often used instead of that of a professional singer when his character sang in his films. Notable productions featuring Mitchum's own singing voice included ''Rachel and the Stranger'', ''River of No Return'' and ''The Night of the Hunter''. After hearing traditional [[calypso music]] and meeting artists such as [[Mighty Sparrow]] and [[Lord Invader]] while filming ''Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison'' in the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] island of [[Trinidad and Tobago|Tobago]], he recorded ''Calypso&nbsp;— is like so ...'' in March 1957. On the album, released through [[Capitol Records]], he emulated the calypso sound and style, even adopting the style's unique pronunciations and slang. A year later he recorded a song he had written for the film ''[[Thunder Road (film)|Thunder Road]]'', titled "[[The Ballad of Thunder Road]]". The [[country music|country]]-style song became a modest hit for Mitchum, reaching No.&nbsp;69 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard Pop Singles Chart]]. The song was included as a bonus track on a successful reissue of ''Calypso ...'' and helped market the film to a wider audience. <ref name="Biography"/>

Although Mitchum continued to use his singing voice in his film work, he waited until 1967 to record his follow-up record, ''That Man, Robert Mitchum, Sings''. The album, released by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]-based [[Monument Records]], took him further into [[country music]], and featured songs similar to ''The Ballad of Thunder Road''. "Little Old Wine Drinker Me", the first single, was a top-ten hit at country radio, reaching No.&nbsp;9 there, and crossed over onto mainstream radio, where it peaked at No.&nbsp;96. Its follow-up, "You Deserve Each Other," also charted on the [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks|Billboard Country Singles Chart]]. He sang the title song to the western ''[[Young Billy Young]]'', made in 1969. Mitchum co-wrote and composed the music for an [[oratorio]] which was produced by [[Orson Welles]] at the [[Hollywood Bowl]].<ref name="Bio">{{IMDb name|53|section=bio}}</ref>{{-}}

==Later career==
[[File:Robert Mitchum 1976 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Mitchum in October 1976]]
Mitchum made a departure from his typical screen persona with the 1970 [[David Lean]] film ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]'', in which he starred as Charles Shaughnessy, a mild-mannered schoolmaster in [[World War I]] era [[Ireland]]. Though the film was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]] (winning two) and Mitchum was much publicized as a contender for a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] nomination, he was not nominated. [[George C. Scott]] won the award for his performance in ''Patton'', a project Mitchum had rejected for ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. The 1970s featured Mitchum in a number of well-received crime dramas. ''[[The Friends of Eddie Coyle]]'' (1973) saw the actor playing an aging [[Boston]] hoodlum caught between the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|Feds]] and his criminal friends. [[Sydney Pollack]]'s ''[[The Yakuza]]'' (1974) transplanted the typical film noir story arc to the [[Japan]]ese underworld. He also appeared in 1976's ''[[Midway (film)|Midway]]'' about an epic 1942 World War II battle. Mitchum's stint as an aging [[Philip Marlowe]] in the [[Raymond Chandler]] adaptation ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]'' (1975) was sufficiently well received by audiences and critics for him to reprise the role in 1978's ''[[The Big Sleep (1978 film)|The Big Sleep]]''.

[[File:Robert Mitchum Cannes.jpg|thumb|left|Mitchum at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]].]]

In 1982, Mitchum went on location to [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] to play Coach Delaney in the film adaptation of playwright/actor [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]]'s 1973 [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning play ''[[That Championship Season (1982 film)|That Championship Season]]''. He expanded to television work with the 1983 [[miniseries]] ''[[The Winds of War (TV miniseries)|The Winds of War]]''. The big-budget [[Herman Wouk]] story aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], starring Mitchum as naval officer "Pug" Henry, and examined the events leading up to [[United States|America]]'s involvement in [[World War II]]. He followed it in 1988 with ''[[War and Remembrance (TV miniseries)|War and Remembrance]]''. <ref name="Biography"/>

Mitchum starred opposite [[Wilford Brimley]] in the 1986 made-for-TV movie ''Thompson's Run''. A hardened con (Mitchum), being transferred from a federal penitentiary to a Texas institution to finish a life sentence as a habitual criminal, is freed at gunpoint by his niece (played by [[Kathleen York]]). The cop (Brimley) who was transferring him, and has been the con's lifelong friend & adversary for over 30 years, vows to catch the twosome. In 1987, Mitchum was the guest-host on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' where he played private eye Philip Marlowe for the last time in the parody sketch, "Death Be Not Deadly". The show also ran a short comedy film he made (written and directed by his daughter, Trina) called ''Out of Gas'', a mock sequel to ''Out of the Past''. ([[Jane Greer]] also reprised her role from the original film.) In 1991, Mitchum won a lifetime achievement award from the [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures]] and the [[Cecil B. DeMille Award]] from the [[Golden Globe Awards]] in 1992. <ref name="Biography"/>

Although Mitchum continued to appear in films throughout the 1990s, such as ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'', [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Dead Man]],'' and appeared, in contrast to his role as the antagonist in the original, as a protagonist police detective in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s remake of ''Cape Fear'', the actor gradually slowed his workload. His last film appearance was a small but pivotal role in the television [[biopic]], ''James Dean: Race with Destiny'', playing ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' director [[George Stevens]]. His last starring role was in the 1995 Norwegian movie ''[[Pakten (movie)|Pakten]]''. <ref name="Biography"/>

Mitchum is regarded by critics as one of the finest actors of the Golden Age of Hollywood. [[Roger Ebert]] called him 'the soul of [[film noir]]'. Mitchum himself, however, was self-effacing; in an interview with [[Barry Norman]] for the [[BBC]] about his contribution to cinema, Mitchum stopped Norman in mid flow and in his typical phlegmatic style said, "Look, I have two kinds of acting. One on a horse and one off a horse. That's it." He had also succeeded in annoying some of his fellow actors by voicing his puzzlement at those who viewed the profession as challenging and hard work. He is quoted as having said in the Barry Norman interview that acting was actually very simple and that his job was to "show up on time, know his lines, hit his marks, and go home".<ref>[http://byronic.tumblr.com/post/512837760/guys-in-ties-88-robert-mitchum-photographed-at ": Mad, bad and dangerous to know."] ''Byronic.''

[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars]] lists Mitchum as the 23rd greatest male actor ([[Carole Lombard]] is the 23rd greatest female actress) in American cinema.  AFI also recognized his performance as the menacing rapist [[Max Cady]] and [[Reverend Harry Powell]] as the 28th and 29th greatest screen villains, respectively, of all time as part of [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains]]. He provided the voice of the famous [[American Beef Council]] commercials that touted "Beef ... it's what's for dinner", from 1992 until his death. There is a '''Mitchum's Steakhouse''' in [[Trappe, Maryland]],<ref>[http://www.mitchumsteakhouse.com "Mitchum's Steakhouse"], mitchumsteakhouse.com; retrieved October 10, 2012.</ref> where Mitchum and his family lived from 1959–1965.<ref name="Bio"/>
