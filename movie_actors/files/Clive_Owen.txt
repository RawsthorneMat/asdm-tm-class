In 2005, he won a [[Golden Globe]] and a [[BAFTA Award]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his appearance in the drama ''[[Closer (film)|Closer]]'' (2004).

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Initially, Owen carved out a career in television. In 1988, he starred as Gideon Sarn in a [[BBC]] production of ''[[Precious Bane]]'' and the [[Channel 4]] film ''Vroom'' before the 1990s saw him become a regular on stage and television in the UK, notably his lead role in the [[ITV Network|ITV]] series ''[[Chancer]]'', followed by an appearance in the [[Thames Television]] production of ''[[Lorna Doone]]''.

He won critical acclaim for his performances in the [[Stephen Poliakoff]] film ''[[Close My Eyes (film)|Close My Eyes]]'' (1991) – in which he has a [[nudity|full frontal nude]] scene – about a brother and sister who embark on an [[incest|incestuous]] love affair. He subsequently appeared in ''The Magician'', ''Class of '61'', ''[[Century (film)|Century]]'', ''[[Nobody's Children]]'', ''[[An Evening with Gary Lineker]]'', ''[[Doomsday Gun]]'', ''[[Return of the Native]]'' and then a Carlton production called ''[[Sharman (TV series)|Sharman]]'', about a private detective. In 1996, he appeared in his first major Hollywood film ''[[The Rich Man's Wife]]'' alongside [[Halle Berry]] before finding international acclaim in a Channel 4 film directed by [[Mike Hodges]] called ''[[Croupier (film)|Croupier]]'' (1998). In ''Croupier'', he played the title role of a struggling writer who takes a job in a London [[casino]] as inspiration for his work, only to get caught up in a robbery scheme. In 1999, he appeared as an accident-prone driver in ''Split Second'', his first BBC production in about a decade.

Owen starred in ''The Echo'', a [[BBC1]] drama, before starring in the film ''[[Greenfingers]]'', about a criminal who goes to work in a garden. He then appeared in the BBC1 mystery series ''[[Second Sight (TV series)|Second Sight]]''.
In 2001, he provided the voice-over for a BBC2 documentary about popular music called ''[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]'', as well as starring in a highly acclaimed theatre production called ''[[A Day in the Death of Joe Egg]]'', about a couple with a severely handicapped daughter.

Owen became well known to [[North America]]n audiences in the summer of 2001 after starring as "The Driver" in ''[[The Hire]]'', a series of short films sponsored by [[BMW]] and made by prominent directors. He then appeared in [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[Gosford Park]]'' among an all-star cast which included [[Helen Mirren]], [[Maggie Smith]], [[Michael Gambon]], [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] and [[Ryan Phillippe]]. He appeared in the 2002 hit ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]''. In 2003, he reteamed with director Mike Hodges in ''[[I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (film)|I'll Sleep When I'm Dead]]''. He starred in ''[[Beyond Borders]]'' and won the [[King Arthur|title role]] in ''[[King Arthur (film)|King Arthur]]'', for which he learned to ride a horse.

He appeared in the West End and [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] hit play ''[[Closer (play)|Closer]]'', by [[Patrick Marber]], which was produced as a [[Closer (film)|film]] in 2004. He played Dan in the play, but was Larry the [[dermatologist]] in the film version. His portrayal of Larry in the film received rave reviews, as well as the [[Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA]] awards, and an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. He noted that the expectations of him since the [[Oscars|Oscar]] nomination have not changed the way he approaches film-making, stating "I try, every film I do, to be as good as I can and that's all I can do."<ref name="">{{cite news | last =Topel | first =Fred | coauthors = | title =Clive Owen: A totally original badass | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =Crave Online | date =4 September 2007 | url =http://www.craveonline.com/filmtv/articles/04648559/3/clive_owen_a_totally_original_badass.html | accessdate =19 September 2007 }}</ref>

After ''Closer'', he appeared in ''[[Derailed (2005 film)|Derailed]]'' alongside [[Jennifer Aniston]], the [[comic book]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'' as the [[Film noir|noir]] [[antihero]] [[Dwight McCarthy]] and as a mysterious bank robber in ''[[Inside Man]]''. Despite public denials, Owen had long been rumoured to be a possible successor to [[Pierce Brosnan]] in the role of [[James Bond]]. A public opinion poll in the United Kingdom in October 2005 (SkyNews) found that he was the public's number one choice to star in the next installment of the series. In that same month, however, it was announced that fellow British actor [[Daniel Craig]] would become the next James Bond. In an interview in the September 2007 issue of ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'', he claimed that he was never offered or even approached concerning the role.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Clive Owen: Details | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =Men.Style.com | date =September 2007 | url =http://men.style.com/details/features/full?id=content_5790&pageNum=2 | accessdate =19 September 2007 }}</ref> In 2006, Owen spoofed the Bond connection by making an appearance in the remake of ''[[The Pink Panther (2006 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' in which he plays a character named "Nigel Boswell, Agent 006" (when he introduces himself to [[Inspector Clouseau]], he quips that Owen's character is "one short of the big time").

[[File:Clive Owen TIFF 2011.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Owen at the [[Toronto Film Festival]], 2011]]
In 2006, Owen starred in the highly acclaimed ''[[Children of Men]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.about.com/od/childrenofmen/a/childco121906_2.htm|title=Children of Men interview |accessdate=17 February 2011|work=movies.about.com}}</ref> for which he received widespread praise.

In June 2010 it was announced that Owen and [[Nicole Kidman]] would star in an [[HBO]] film about [[Ernest Hemingway]] and his relationship with Martha Gellhorn entitled ''[[Hemingway & Gellhorn]]''. [[James Gandolfini]] served as executive producer to the film, written by [[Barbara Turner (actress)|Barbara Turner]] and [[Jerry Stahl]].
