'''John Thomas Sayles''' (born September 28, 1950) is an American [[independent film]] director, screenwriter, editor, actor and author.  He has twice been nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for ''[[Passion Fish]]'' (1992) and ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1996).

==Early life==
Sayles was born in [[Schenectady, New York]], the son of Mary ([[married and maiden names|''née'']] Rausch), a teacher, and Donald John Sayles, a school administrator.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/25/John-Sayles.html John Sayles Biography (1950–)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>  Both of Sayles's parents were of half-Irish descent and were Catholic.<ref>[http://www.talkingpix.co.uk/Interview_John%20Sayles.html John Sayles Interview<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He attended [[Williams College]].

==Career==
Like [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[James Cameron]], among others, Sayles began his film career working with [[Roger Corman]]. In 1979, Sayles funded his first film, ''[[Return of the Secaucus 7]]'', with $30,000 he had in the bank from writing scripts for Corman.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} He set the film in a large house so that he did not have to travel to or get permits for different locations, set it over a three-day weekend to limit costume changes, and wrote about people his age so that he could have his friends act in it. The film received near-unanimous critical acclaim at the time and has held its reputation. In November 1997, the [[National Film Preservation Board]] announced that ''Return of the Secaucus 7'' would be one of the 25 films selected that year for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] at the [[Library of Congress]].

In 1983, after the films ''[[Baby It's You (film)|Baby It's You]]'' (starring [[Rosanna Arquette]]) and ''[[Lianna]]'' (a story in which a married woman becomes discontented with her marriage and falls in love with another woman), Sayles received a [[MacArthur Fellowship]]. He used the money to partially fund the fantasy ''[[The Brother from Another Planet]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,954425,00.html | title=Blues for Black Actors | author=[[Richard Corliss]] | date=October 1, 1984 | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate=August 13, 2010}}</ref> a film about a black, three-toed slave who escapes from another planet and finds himself at home among the people of [[Harlem]].

[[File:Sayles, John IMGP2516-A.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Sayles at the [[Miami Book Fair International]] 2011]]

In 1989, Sayles created and wrote the pilot episode for the short-lived television show ''[[Shannon's Deal]]'' about a down-and-out [[Philadelphia]] lawyer played by [[Jamey Sheridan]]. Sayles received a 1990 [[Edgar Award]] for his [[screenplay|teleplay]] for the pilot. The show ran for 16 episodes before being canceled in 1991.

Sayles has funded most of his films by writing genre scripts, such as ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]'', ''[[Alligator (film)|Alligator]]'', ''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling]]'' and ''[[The Challenge (1982 film)|The Challenge]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Having collaborated with [[Joe Dante]] on ''Piranha'' and ''The Howling'', Sayles acted in Dante's movie, ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]''. In deciding whether to take a job, Sayles reports that he is interested mostly in whether there is the germ of an idea for a movie which he would want to watch.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Sayles gets the rest of his funding by working as a script doctor; he did rewrites for ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', and ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]''.

A genre script, called ''[[Night Skies]]'', inspired what would eventually become the film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} That film's director, [[Steven Spielberg]], later commissioned Sayles to write a script (unused) for the [[Development of Jurassic World|fourth ''Jurassic Park'' film]].

He has written and directed his own films, including ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'', ''[[Passion Fish]]'', ''[[Eight Men Out]]'', ''[[The Secret of Roan Inish]],'' and ''[[Matewan]]''. He serves on the advisory board for the [[Austin Film Society]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[Maggie Renzi]] has been John Sayles' long-time companion (and [[Collaboration|collaborator]]), but they have not married. Renzi has produced most of his films since ''Lianna''. They met as students at Williams College.

Sayles works with a regular repertory of actors, most notably [[Chris Cooper]], [[David Strathairn]], and [[Gordon Clapp]], each of whom has appeared in at least four of his films.

In early 2003, Sayles signed the Not In Our Name "Statement of Conscience" (along with [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Oliver Stone]], [[Marisa Tomei]], [[Susan Sarandon]] and others) which opposed the invasion of [[Iraq]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In February 2009, Sayles was reported to be writing an [[HBO]] series based on the early life of [[Anthony Kiedis]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. The drama, tentatively titled ''[[Scar Tissue]]'', centers on Kiedis's early years living in [[West Hollywood]] with his father. At that time, Kiedis's father, known as Spider, sold drugs (according to legend, his clients included [[The Who]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]) and mingled with rock stars on the Sunset Strip, all while aspiring to get into show business.<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000444.html Sayles red hot for HBO's 'Scar'] from ''Variety''</ref>

In February 2010, Sayles began shooting his 17th feature film, the historical war drama ''[[Amigo (film)|Amigo]]'', in the Philippines. The film is a fictional account of events during the [[Philippine–American War]], with a cast that includes Joel Torre, Chris Cooper, and [[Garret Dillahunt]].<ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/238469/joel-torre-believes-baryo-may-stir-controversy Joel Torre believes ‘Baryo’ may stir controversy] from www.mb.com.ph</ref>

His novel ''A Moment in the Sun'', set during the same period as ''Amigo'', in the Philippines, Cuba, and the US, was released in 2011 by [[McSweeney’s]]. It includes an account of the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]] in North Carolina, the only [[coup d'état]] in United States history in which a duly elected government was overthrown.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.johnsayles.com/body-bio.html | title=BIOGRAPHY OF JOHN SAYLES | publisher=johnsayles.com | accessdate=August 13, 2010}}</ref>
