'''Robert "Rob" Reiner''' (born March 6, 1947) is an American actor, director, producer, and activist.<!-- STOP!!! DO NOT add any non-notable occupations. Please only list enterprises that he is famous for --> As an actor, Reiner first came to national prominence with the role of [[Michael Stivic]], son-in-law of [[Archie Bunker|Archie]] and [[Edith Bunker]] (played by [[Carroll O'Connor]] and [[Jean Stapleton]]), on ''[[All in the Family]]'' (1971–78). That role earned him two [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor - Comedy Series|Emmy Awards]] during the 1970s. As a director, Reiner was recognized by the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA) with nominations for the [[coming of age]] [[drama]] [[comedy]] ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'' (1986), the [[romantic comedy film]] ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), and the [[legal drama|courtroom drama]] ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992). He also directed the [[psychological horror]] [[thriller film]] ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' (1990), the [[romantic comedy film|romantic comedy]] [[fantasy]] [[adventure film]] ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987) and the heavy metal comedy-[[mockumentary]] ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984).

==Early life==
Reiner was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[The Bronx]], New York, and is the son of [[Estelle Reiner]] (née Lebost), an actress, and [[Carl Reiner]], a renowned comedian, actor, writer, producer, and director.<ref name=filmref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/74/Rob-Reiner.html |title=Rob Reiner Biography (1947–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}</ref> As a child, Reiner lived at 48 Bonnie Meadow Road in [[New Rochelle, New York]]; the home of the fictional Petrie family in ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'', created by Rob's father, was 148 Bonnie Meadow Lane. He studied at the [[UCLA Film School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/alumni/notable—-directors/ |title=Alumni of the UCLA Film School |publisher=Tft.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
In the late 1960s, Reiner acted in bit roles in several television shows including ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.  He began his career writing for the ''[[Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' in 1968 and 1969. A few years later, Reiner became famous playing Michael Stivic, Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, on [[Norman Lear]]'s 1970s situation comedy ''All in the Family'', which was the most-watched television program in the United States for five seasons (1971–1976).  The character's nickname became closely associated with him, even after he had left the role and went on to build a high-profile career as a director.  Reiner has stated, "I could win the Nobel Prize and they'd write 'Meathead wins the Nobel Prize'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yehey.com/entertainment/celebs/article.aspx?id=106489 |title=Yehey! Entertainment |publisher=Yehey.com |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}</ref> For his performance, Reiner won two [[Emmy Awards]] in addition to three other nominations and five [[Golden Globe]] nominations. After an extended absence, Reiner has recently returned to television acting with a recurring role on ''[[New Girl (TV series)|New Girl]]'' (2012–present).

In 1972, Reiner, Phil Mishkin, and Gerry Isenberg created the situation comedy ''[[The Super (TV series)|The Super]]'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Starring [[Richard S. Castellano]], the show depicted the life of the harried Italian American [[Building superintendent|superintendent]] of a New York City [[apartment building]] and ran for 10 episodes in the summer of 1972. Reiner and Mishkin co-wrote the premiere episode.

Beginning in the 1980s, Reiner became known as a director of several successful Hollywood films that spanned many different genres. Several of these film remains highly popular with fans and critics. Some of his earlier films include cult classics such as the rock-band [[mockumentary]]  ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984) and the comedic fantasy film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987), as well as his period piece coming of age tale ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'' (1986), which was also highly acclaimed. He often collaborates with film editor [[Robert Leighton (film editor)|Robert Leighton]], whom he also shares with fellow director-actor [[Christopher Guest]] as their go-to editor.

Reiner has gone on to direct other critically and commercially successful films with his own company, [[Castle Rock Entertainment]]. These include several iconic films such as the romantic comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), which has been critically ranked among the all-time best of its genre,<ref>{{cite news | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 | date = 2008-06-17 | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/romanticcomedy.html | accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref> the tense thriller ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' (1990), for which [[Kathy Bates]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and his most commercially successful work, the military courtroom drama ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), which was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=robreiner.htm |title=Rob Reiner |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2010}}</ref> Subsequent films directed by Reiner include the political romance ''[[The American President]]'' (1995), the courtroom drama ''[[Ghosts of Mississippi]]'' (1996), and the uplifting comedy ''[[The Bucket List]]'' (2007).

Reiner has continued to act in supporting roles in a number of movies and television shows, including ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'' (1987), ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' (1993), ''[[Bullets Over Broadway]]'' (1994), ''[[The First Wives Club]]'' (1996), ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998),  ''[[EDtv]]'' (1999), ''[[New Girl (TV series)|New Girl]]'' (2012–present), and ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' (2013). He has also parodied himself with cameos in works such as ''[[Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star]]'' (2003) and ''[[30 Rock]]'' (2010).

==Politics and activism==
[[Image:Rob Reiner at Howard Dean rally.JPG|left|thumb|Rob Reiner speaking at a [[Howard Dean]] rally on Oct 29, 2003]]
Reiner has devoted considerable time and energy to [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] activism in recent years. His lobbying as an anti-smoking advocate in particular, earned his likeness a satirical role in a ''[[South Park]]'' episode titled "[[Butt Out]]".

Reiner is a co-founder of the [[American Foundation for Equal Rights]], which initiated the court challenge against [[California Proposition 8]] which banned same-sex marriage in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wehoconfidential.com/2010/08/civil-rights-activist-director-rob.html |title=Civil Rights Activist: Director Rob Reiner |publisher=WeHo Confidential |date=August 2010 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}</ref>

In 1998, Reiner chaired the campaign to pass Prop 10, the [[California Proposition 10 (1998)|California Children and Families Initiative]], which created First 5 California, a program of early childhood development services, funded by a tax on tobacco products. He served as the first chairman of First 5 California, from 1999 to 2006. Reiner came under criticism for campaigning for a ballot measure (Prop 82) to fund state-run preschools while still chair of the First Five Commission, causing him to resign from his position on March 29, 2006. An audit was conducted, and it concluded that the state commission did not violate state law and that it had clear legal authority to conduct its public advertising campaigns related to preschool. In the end, Prop 82 failed to win approval, garnering only 39.1% support.

Reiner was mentioned as a possible candidate to run against California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] in 2006 but decided not to run for personal reasons. He campaigned extensively for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Al Gore]] in the [[2000 Presidential election]], and he campaigned in [[Iowa]] for Democratic Presidential candidate [[Howard Dean]] just before the 2004 Iowa caucuses. He endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] for president for the 2008 election.

Reiner is a member of the Social Responsibility Task Force, an organization advocating moderation where social issues (such as violence and tobacco use) and the entertainment industry meet.

Reiner is also active in environmental issues, and he successfully led the effort to establish California's [[Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve|Ahmanson Ranch]] as a state park and wildlife refuge rather than as a commercial real estate development. He introduced [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] at the London Live Earth concert in July 2007.

==Personal life==
Rob Reiner married actress/director [[Penny Marshall]] in 1971 and adopted Marshall's daughter from a previous marriage, actress [[Tracy Reiner]]. Reiner and Marshall divorced in 1981.<ref>Abramowitz, p. 291</ref>

Reiner was introduced to his future wife, photographer Michele Singer, while directing ''When Harry Met Sally''.  That meeting not only resulted in his deciding to change the ending of that movie{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}, but he also eventually married Singer in 1989. They have three children. In 1997, Reiner and Singer founded the "I Am Your Child Foundation," now "Parents' Action for Children," a non-profit organization promoting early childhood development by producing and distributing celebrity-hosted educational videos for parents.

Reiner has stated that his childhood home was not observantly Jewish, although he did have a [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]].<ref>[http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-features/76866/rob-reiner-at-last-i%E2%80%99m-having-what-she%E2%80%99s-having Thejc.com]</ref> He identified himself as having no religious affiliation on the January 13, 2012, episode of ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]''.<ref name=reinerbelief>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/debra-ollivier/rob-reiner-on-the-magic-o_b_1618957.html |title=Debra Ollivier: Rob Reiner On The Magic Of Belle Isle And 'Living Your Life Until You Can't' |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref>  Reiner later told Huffington Post contributor Debra Oliver that while he rejected organized religion, he was sympathetic to the ideas of [[Buddhism]].<ref name=reinerbelief />

In addition to his four children, Reiner has five grandchildren.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0718021/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm Rob Reiner grandchildren]</ref>
