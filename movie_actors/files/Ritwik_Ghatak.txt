Along with prominent contemporary Bengali filmmakers [[Satyajit Ray]] and [[Mrinal Sen]], his cinema is primarily remembered for its meticulous depiction of social reality. Although their roles were often adversarial, they were ardent admirers of each other's work and, in doing so, the three directors charted the independent trajectory of [[parallel cinema]], as a counterpoint to the mainstream fare of Hindi cinema in India. Ghatak received many awards in his career, including [[National Film Award for Best Story|National Film Award's Rajat Kamal Award]] for Best Story in 1974 for his ''[[Jukti Takko Aar Gappo]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iffi.nic.in/Dff2011/Frm22ndNFAAward.aspx?PdfName=22NFA.pdf |title=Na22nd National Film Awards |publisher=Iffi.nic.in |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> and Best Director's Award from Bangladesh Cine Journalist's Association for ''[[Titash Ekti Nadir Naam]]''.

== Early life ==
Ritwik Ghatak was born in [[Dhaka]] in [[Bengal Presidency|East Bengal]] (now [[Bangladesh]]).<ref>Hood, J.W.: ''The Essential Mystery'', page 20.</ref> Ghatak's father Suresh Chandra Ghatak was a district magistrate and a poet and playwright; his mother's name was Indubala Devi. He and his twin sister Prateeti, were the youngest of nine children. The other children were Manish, Sudhish, Tapati, Sampreeti, Brototi, Ashish Chandra and Lokesh Chandra. He and his family moved to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) just before millions of other refugees from East Bengal began to flood into the city, fleeing the catastrophic [[Bengal famine of 1943]] and the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partition of Bengal]] in 1947. Identification with this tide of refugees was to define his practice, providing an over-riding [[metaphor]] for cultural dismemberment and exile that unified his subsequent creative work. The 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], which led to more refugees fleeing to [[India]], was to have a similar impact on his work.

== Family ==
Ritwik married Surama Devi, niece of active left-wing member, Sadhana Roychowdhury. They separated and she went to her ancestral place, [[Shillong]] after Ritwik was temporarily sent to a mental hospital. They had three children: son Ritaban and two daughters. Ritaban is a filmmaker<ref name="Ritaban Ghatak">{{cite web|title=Ritaban Ghatak |url=http://www.biff.kr/eng/html/archive/arc_search_view.asp?idx=265&target=search&c_idx=16&m_entry_year=1996 |publisher=Biff.kr/ |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref> in his own right and is involved in the Ritwik Memorial Trust. He has restored Ritwik's ''Bagalar Banga Darshan'', ''Ronger Golam'' and completed his unfinished documentary on Ramkinkar. He has also made a film titled ''Unfinished Ritwik''. He is now working on adapting [[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay]]'s short story 'Ichhamati'. Ritwik's elder daughter Samhita, has made a docufeature titled ''Nobo Nagarik''. His younger daughter passed away in 2009.<ref name="My husband as I saw him" >{{cite web|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VE9JS00vMjAwOS8xMi8xNyNBcjAyNjAw |title=My husband as I saw him |publisher= |accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref>
Ghatak's elder brother [[Manish Ghatak]] was a radical writer of his time, a professor of English and a social activist who was deeply involved with the [[Indian People's Theatre Association|IPTA]] theatre movement in its heyday and later on headed the [[Tebhaga movement|Tebhaga Andolan]] of North Bengal. Manish Ghatak's daughter is the writer and activist [[Mahasweta Devi]].

== Creative career ==
In 1948, Ghatak wrote his first play ''Kalo sayar'' (The Dark Lake) and participated in a revival of the landmark play ''[[Nabanna (play)|Nabanna]]''.<ref name="JamesonMiyoshi1998">{{cite book|author1=Fredric Jameson|author2=Masao Miyoshi |title=The Cultures of Globalization|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fsQOE03q4I0C&pg=PA195|accessdate=5 October 2012 |date=30 June 1998|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-2169-9|pages=195–}}</ref> In 1951, Ghatak joined the [[Indian People's Theatre Association]] (IPTA). He wrote, directed and acted in plays and translated [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Gogol]] into Bengali. In early 1970s, he wrote and directed his last play ''Jwala'' (The Burning). The music director was Darbar Bhaduri, who was called by Ghatak 'Dada' or 'Guru' from his childhood. Ghatak was greatly inspired by Darbar Bhaduri. In Rajshahi, Bangladeh—his homeland Ritwik lived beside Bhaduri's house. Almost all time he was with Darbar Bhaduri. Darbar Bhaduri was a 'King maker' who kept away from outside world. Ghatak by pressure made Darbar Bhaduri the music director of ''Jwala'', and the music was extraordinary.

Ghatak entered the film industry with Nimai Ghosh's ''[[Chinnamul]]'' (1950) as actor and assistant director. ''[[Chinnamul]]'' was followed in two years by Ghatak's first completed film ''[[Nagarik]]'' (1952), both major breakthroughs for the [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]].<ref name="Ghatak">{{Cite book | last1 = Ghatak | given1 = Ritwik | year = 2000 | title = Rows and Rows of Fences: Ritwik Ghatak on Cinema | publisher = Ritwik Memorial & Trust Seagull Books | isbn = 81-7046-178-2 | pages= ix & 134–36 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}} }}</ref> Ghatak's early work sought theatrical and literary precedent in bringing together a documentary realism, a stylised performance often drawn from the folk theatre, and a Brechtian use of the filmic apparatus.

Ghatak's first commercial release was ''Ajantrik'' (1958), a [[comedy-drama]] film with science fiction themes. It was one of the earliest Indian films to portray an inanimate object, in this case an automobile, as a character in the story.

Ghatak's greatest commercial success as a script writer was for ''[[Madhumati]]'' (1958), one of the earliest films to deal with the theme of [[reincarnation]]. It was a [[Bollywood|Hindi film]] directed by another Bengali filmmaker [[Bimal Roy]]. It earned Ghatak his first award nomination, for the [[Filmfare Best Story Award]].

Ritwik Ghatak directed eight full-length films. His best-known films, ''Meghe Dhaka Tara'' (''The Cloud-Capped Star'') (1960), ''Komal Gandhar'' (''E-Flat'') (1961), and ''[[Subarnarekha (film)|Subarnarekha]]'' (''Golden Lining'') (1962), a trilogy based in Calcutta and addressing the condition of refugee-hood, proved controversial and the commercial failure of ''Komal Gandhar'' (''E-Flat'') and ''Subarnarekha'' prevented him from making features through the remainder of the 1960s. In all three, he used a basic and at times starkly realistic storyline, upon which he inscribed a range of mythic references, especially of the 'Mother Deliverer', through a dense overlay of visual and aural registers.

[[File:Ritwik Ghatak (Young age photo).png|thumb|200px|Ritwik Ghatak, at young age]]
Ghatak moved briefly to [[Pune]] in 1966, where he taught at the [[Film and Television Institute of India]] (FTII). During his year at FTII, he was involved in the making of two student films: ''[[Fear (Short film)|Fear'']] and ''Rendezvous''.

Ghatak returned to filmmaking in the 1970s, when a Bangladeshi producer financed the 1973 epic ''Titash Ekti Nadir Naam'' (''A River Called Titas''). Making films became difficult because of his poor health due to extreme alcoholism and consequent diseases. His last film was the autobiographical ''Jukti Takko Aar Gappo'' (''Reason, Debate And Story'') (1974), in which he portrayed Neelkantha (Nilkanth) the lead character.<ref>Hood, J.W.: ''The Essential Mystery'', page 45.</ref> He also had a number of incomplete feature and short films in his credit.

== Impact and influence ==
[[File:Keno Cheye Achho Go Maa.JPG|thumb|left|A scene from Ghatak's last film ''[[Jukti Takko Aar Gappo]]'' (1974)]]

At the time of his death (February 1976), Ghatak's primary impact would seem to have been through former students. Though his stint teaching film at FTII was brief, one-time students [[Mani Kaul]], [[John Abraham (director)|John Abraham]], and especially [[Kumar Shahani]] (among many others),<ref name="Heide2006">{{cite book|author=William van der Heide|title=Bollywood Babylon: Interviews with Shyam Benegal|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_3fi_o1JzY4C&pg=PA44|accessdate=5 October 2012 |date=12 June 2006|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-405-1|pages=44–}}</ref> carried Ghatak's ideas and theories, which were further elaborated upon in his book ''Cinema And I'', into the mainstream of [[Parallel Cinema|Indian art film]]. Other students of his at the FTII included the acclaimed filmmakers [[Saeed Akhtar Mirza]] and [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Summer Viewing&nbsp;— The Brilliance of Ritwik Ghatak|author=Chitra Parayath|publisher=Lokvani |date=8 November 2004 |url=http://www.lokvani.com/lokvani/article.php?article_id=1899|accessdate=30 May 2009}}</ref>

Ghatak stood entirely outside the world of [[Cinema of India|Indian commercial film]]. None of the elements of the commercial cinema (singing and dancing, melodrama, stars, glitz) featured in his work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} He was watched by students and intelligentsia, not by the masses. His students have tended to work in the art cinema or independent cinema tradition.

While other neo-realist directors like [[Satyajit Ray]] succeeded in creating an audience outside [[India]] during their lifetime, Ghatak was not so fortunate. While he was alive, his films were appreciated primarily within India. Satyajit Ray did what he could to promote his colleague, but Ray's generous praise did not translate into international fame for Ghatak. For example, Ghatak's ''[[Nagarik]]'' (1952) was perhaps the earliest example of a Bengali art film, preceding Ray's ''[[Pather Panchali (film)|Pather Panchali]]'' by three years but was not released until after his death in 1977.<ref name="Ghatak" /><ref name="Hood" /> His first commercial release ''Ajantrik'' (1958) was one of the earliest Indian films to portray an inanimate object, an automobile, as a character in the story, many years before the [[Herbie]] films.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Megan |last=Carrigy |title=Ritwik Ghatak|journal=[[Senses of Cinema]]|date=October 2003 |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/03/ghatak.html |accessdate=3 May 2009|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref> Ghatak's ''[[Bari Theke Paliye]]'' (1958) had a similar plot to [[François Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959), but Ghatak's film remained obscure while Truffaut's went on to become one of the most famous of the [[French New Wave]]. One of Ghatak's final films, ''[[Titash Ekti Nadir Naam]]'' (1973), is one of the earliest to be told in a [[Hyperlink cinema|hyperlink format]], featuring multiple characters in a collection of interconnected stories, predating [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) by two years.

Ghatak's only major commercial success was ''[[Madhumati]]'' (1958), a [[Bollywood|Hindi film]] which he wrote the screenplay for. It was one of the earliest to deal with the theme of [[reincarnation]] and is believed to have been the source of inspiration for many later works dealing with reincarnation in [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]], [[Television in India|Indian television]], and perhaps [[world cinema]]. It may have been the source of inspiration for the American film ''[[The Reincarnation of Peter Proud]]'' (1975) and the Hindi film ''[[Karz (film)|Karz]]'' (1980), both of which dealt with reincarnation and have been influential in their respective cultures.<ref name="Doniger">{{Cite book|last=Doniger |first=Wendy |title=The woman who pretended to be who she was: myths of self-imitation|chapter=Chapter 6: Reincarnation|pages=112–136 [135]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-19-516016-9|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref> ''Karz'' in particular was remade several times: as the [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada film]] ''Yuga Purusha'' (1989), the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil film]] ''[[Enakkul Oruvan]]'' (1984), and more recently the [[Bollywood]] ''[[Karzzzz (film)|Karzzzz]]'' (2008). ''Karz'' and ''The Reincarnation of Peter Proud'' may have inspired the American ''[[Chances Are (film)|Chances Are]]'' (1989).<ref name="Doniger" /> The most recent film to be directly inspired by ''Madhumati'' was the hit Bollywood film ''[[Om Shanti Om (film)|Om Shanti Om]]'' (2007), which led to the late [[Bimal Roy]]'s daughter [[Rinki Bhattacharya]] accusing it of plagiarism and threatening legal action against its producers.<ref name="mir">[http://www.mumbaimirror.com/net/mmpaper.aspx?page=article&sectid=30&contentid=20080807200808070235582987cdd87f Ashanti nags Om Shanti Om]{{dead link|date=June 2012}} [[Mumbai Mirror]], 7 August 2008.</ref><ref name="hum">{{cite web|url=http://www.humsurfer.com/shah-rukh-farah-sued-writer-claims-srk-stole-his-script-for-om-shanti-om |title=Shah Rukh, Farah Sued: Writer Claims SRK stole his script for Om Shanti Om |publisher=Humsurfer.com |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>

Ghatak's work as a director had an impact on many later Indian filmmakers, including those from the [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film industry]] and elsewhere. Ghatak is said to have influences on [[Kumar Shahani]], Mani Kaul, [[Ketan Mehta]], and [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]]. For example, [[Mira Nair]] has cited Ghatak as well as Ray as the reasons she became a filmmaker.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why we admire Ray so much|publisher=Naachgana|date=14 April 2009|url=http://www.naachgaana.com/2009/04/14/why-we-admire-satyajit-ray-so-much|accessdate=6 June 2009}}</ref> Ghatak's impact as a director began to spread beyond India much later; beginning in the 1990s, a project to restore Ghatak's films was undertaken, and international exhibitions (and subsequent DVD releases) have belatedly generated an increasingly global audience. In a critics' poll of [[Films considered the best ever|all-time greatest films]] conducted by the [[Cinema of Asia|Asian film]] magazine ''[[Cinemaya]]'' in 1998, ''[[Subarnarekha (film)|Subarnarekha]]'' was ranked at No. 11.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The "Sight & Sound" of Canons |first=Donato |last=Totaro|journal=Offscreen Journal|publisher=[[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]]|date=31 January 2003|url=http://www.horschamp.qc.ca/new_offscreen/canon.html|accessdate=19 April 2009|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Bangladeshi filmmaker [[Shahnewaz Kakoli]] said she has been greatly influenced by Ritwik Ghatak's films and regarded Ghatak as her idol. She told–<ref name="Bangladeshi filmmaker idolises Ritwik Ghatak">{{cite web|title=Bangladeshi filmmaker idolises Ritwik Ghatak|url=http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/2012/11/13/199--Bangladeshi-filmmaker-idolises-Ritwik-Ghatak-.html|publisher=News Track India|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>
<blockquote>Like all Bengalis, I too have grown up watching movies of Satyajit Ray and Ghatak, though I like Ghatak more and I idolise him. I am greatly inspired by him and consequently my movie 'Uttarer Sur' (Northern Symphony) too is influenced by Ghatak.</blockquote>

== Works ==
{{Main|List of works of Ritwik Ghatak}}
Though Ghatak is mainly known as film director, he wrote many stories and plays. In his creative career, Ghatak made eight full-length feature films and few short films and documentaries. He also wrote many short stories, plays and poetries. Ghatak wrote more than 50 articles and essays on film.

== Ideology ==
Ghatak was not only a film director, he was a theorist, too. His views and commentaries on films have been parts of scholarly studies and researches. As a filmmaker his main concentration was on men and life and specially the day-to-day struggle of ordinary men. He could never accept the partition of India of 1947 which divided Bengal into two countries. In almost all his film he dealt with this theme.<ref name="Bhatia2008">{{cite book|author=Nandi Bhatia|title=Partitioned Lives: Narratives of Home, Displacement, and Resettlement|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YWB0GmmoOSMC&pg=PA68|accessdate=4 November 2012 |year=2008 |publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-1416-4|pages=68–}}</ref>

Filmmaking was not only art for him. In his opinion it was only a means to the end of serving people: It was only a means of expressing his anger at the sorrows and sufferings of his people.<ref name="Cinema and I RG">{{cite book|last=Ghatak |first=Ritwik |title=Cinema and I|year=1987|publisher=Ritwik Memorial Trust|pages=77'}}</ref>
