'''Bowen Charlton "Sonny" Tufts III''' (July 16, 1911 &ndash; June 4, 1970) was an American stage, film and television actor and opera singer.

==Early life and family==
Bowen Charlton Tufts III (nicknamed "Sonny") was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] into a prominent banking family. The Tufts family [[patriarch]], [[Peter Tufts]], sailed to America from [[Wilby, Norfolk]], [[England]] in 1638. His great uncle was businessman and philanthropist [[Charles Tufts]], for whom [[Tufts University]] is named.<ref name="lamparski1">{{cite book|last=Lamparski|first=Richard|title=Whatever Became Of--?: Second Series|year=1968|publisher=Crown Publishers|page=146}}</ref>

Tufts attended the [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and later broke with the family banking tradition by studying [[opera]] at [[Yale University]], where he was an editor of campus humor magazine ''[[The Yale Record]]'',<ref name="lamparski1"/><ref>"Sonny Tufts, Boston And Yale Scion, Makes Good In Movies". ''Miami Daily News''. July 7, 1943. p. 21.</ref> He was also a member of the [[Skull and Bones]] society and played for the Yale football team. Tufts also performed in a musical group, The Wiffenpoofs, and toured with the group in Europe. While touring in [[Naples]], Tufts decided to study [[opera]]. He studied opera in Paris for one year and in the United States for three years.<ref name="graham">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19430707&id=bwktAAAAIBAJ&sjid=udcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6211,1332402|title=Sonny Tufts, Boston and Yale Scion, Makes Good In Movies|last=Graham|first=Sheliah|work=The Miami News|pages=7–C|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref>

==Career==
After graduating from Yale in 1935, Tufts auditioned with the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in [[New York]] but eventually worked on the Broadway stage. He appeared in the stage show ''Who's Who'' and ''Sing for Your Supper''. Tufts then began singing in hotels and nightclubs. A Yale classmate of Tufts' later convinced him to move to [[Hollywood]] to begin a career as an actor. Upon arriving in Hollywood, Tufts' friend, hotel manager Jack Donnelly, accompanied Tufts to [[Paramount Pictures]] and introduced him to a casting director Joe Egli. Egli shot a screen test with Tufts who was then signed to Paramount. His first role was as Kansas, an affable [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] and love interest of [[Paulette Goddard]] in the 1943 [[World War II]] romantic drama ''[[So Proudly We Hail!]]''.<ref name="graham"/> The film was a critical and box office hit, largely due to the three female leads: [[Claudette Colbert]], Paulette Goddard and [[Veronica Lake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/86514%7c0/So-Proudly-We-Hail.html|title=So Proudly We Hail!|last=Nixon|first=Rob|publisher=tcm.com|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref> Tufts' performance was praised by critics and the role served as a launching pad for Tufts' career. After the release of the film, Tufts received 1700 fan letters a week and was named "The Find of 1943."<ref name="lewiston">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1913&dat=19441208&id=FwcjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AGoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5075,5099172|title=Sonny Tufts Sets Hollywood Record|date=December 8, 1944|work=Lewiston Evening Journal|pages=A–5|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref>
The following year, Tufts was cast opposite [[Olivia de Havilland]] in the comedy ''[[Government Girl]]''.<ref name="graham"/> That same year, he was voted the number one "Star of Tomorrow" by exhibitors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26044148 |title=Saga of the High Seas|newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 - 1954)]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=November 11, 1944 |accessdate=April 24, 2012 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Before filming of ''So Proudly We Hail!'' was complete, director [[Mark Sandrich]] commissioned ''So Proudly'''s screenwriter [[Allan Scott (American screenwriter)|Allan Scott]] to write a vehicle for Tufts and his co-star Paulette Goddard.<ref name="lewiston"/> That film, entitled ''[[I Love a Soldier]]'', was released in 1945. During World War II, Tufts' popularity continued to rise principally because, due to an old [[college football]] injury, he was one of the few male actors not serving overseas in the war.<ref name="thomas">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19791128&id=6i1PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kgIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7045,7318654|title=And Whatever Happened To Sonny Tufts Anyway?|last=Thomas|first=Bob|date=November 28, 1979|work=Toledo Blade|page=P–2|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref> By the early 1950s, Tufts' popularity began to wane and his career began to decline. In 1953, Tufts was cast opposite [[Barbara Payton]] in the low budget comedy film ''Run for the Hills''. Later that year, he co-starred in another low budget film, ''[[Cat-Women of the Moon]]''. Tufts' career briefly rebounded when he was cast in a small role in the comedy ''[[The Seven Year Itch]]'', starring [[Tom Ewell]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]]. In 1956, Tufts had a supporting role in drama ''[[Come Next Spring]]'' for [[Republic Pictures]].

Tuft's career decline was compounded by his alcoholism and his off-screen antics.<ref name="thomas"/> In February 1954, a 19-year-old dancer named Margarie Von accused Tufts of biting her on the right thigh while she was relaxing aboard a yacht docked off the coast of [[Balboa Peninsula, Newport Beach]]. Von sued Tuft for $26,000 claiming the bite left a three inch scar. Von later settled for $600.<ref name=reading>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19550118&id=ewUrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AJgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6618,91579|title=Dancer's Biting Claim Settled For $600|date=January 8, 1955|work=Reading Eagle|page=8|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref> In March 1954, a stripper named Barbara Gray Atkins sued Tufts for $25,000 in damages after she claimed he bit her left thigh while he and two friends were visiting her home.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19540331&id=nY0yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=l-gFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3128,7496977|title=Tufts Puts "The Bite" On Stripper|date=March 31, 1954|work=The Miami News|page=7–B|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref> Atkins later dropped the lawsuit against Tufts.<ref name=reading/>

After filming ''[[The Parson and the Outlaw]]'' in 1957, Tufts retreated to a ranch in [[Texas]]. He returned to acting in 1963 with a guest appearance on ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''. His final onscreen role was in the 1968 television movie ''Land's End''.

==Personal life==
In 1938, Tufts married [[Spanish dancer]] Barbara Dare.<ref name="lamparski">Lamparski 1968 p.147</ref> They separated in 1949 and Dare filed for divorce in 1951 citing Tufts' excessive drinking as the reason for the breakup of their marriage.<ref name="lamparski"/><ref name="eugene">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19520917&id=PcoUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xOIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4819,4021662|title=Divorce Due For Actor|date=September 17, 1952|work=Eugene Register-Guard|page=8–G|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref> Dare was granted an [[Interlocutory|interlocutory divorce]] on October 21, 1951 which was finalized the following year.<ref name="eugene"/>

==Death==
On June 4, 1970, Tufts died of [[pneumonia]] at age 58 at [[Saint John's Health Center|St. John's Hospital]] in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat=19700606&id=4ZgrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pPUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3287,890955|title=Sonny Tufts, Noted Actor, Dead at 58|date=June 6, 1970|work=The Telegraph|page=3|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref> Tufts' private funeral was held on June 7 in [[Beverly Hills]] after which he was buried in Munroe Cemetery in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19700608&id=DOgzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1jIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=1649,6160194|title=Sonny Tufts' Rites|date=June 8, 1960|work=Lodi News-Sentinel|page=1|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref>

==In popular culture==

In a [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]] on the cartoon show ''[[Rocky and His Friends]]'', in the ''[[Jet Fuel Formula]]'' story arc, [[Bullwinkle J. Moose]] becomes very upset when [[Boris Badenov]] steals his autographed picture of Sonny Tufts. Also, Tufts is mentioned in the last sentence of the third sketch of the 48th show of the second season of the ''[[Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'' (also featuring Wailing Whale episodes 5 & 6), which was first aired on May 13, 1961.

In an episode of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', Rob sees a flying saucer that makes a noise "Uhny Uftz", which Rob mis-hears as "Sonny Tufts"<ref>{{IMDb title|0559857}}</ref>

In an episode of ''[[My Mother the Car]]'' titled "And Leave The Drive-In To Us," Mother wants to go to a [[drive-in]] to see Sonny Tufts for her birthday. Tufts himself makes an appearance at the very end of the episode, much to Mother's appreciation, and causing her radiator cap to pop!

In the November 26, 1966 episode of ''[[The Monkees]]'', "I've Got a Little Song Here", [[Micky Dolenz]], posing as a Hollywood studio head, says he's making a blockbuster movie, starring, "... [[Gregory Peck]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Doris Day]], and Sonny Tufts."  To which the other person exclaims incredulously, "Sonny T---??  What a production!".

Tufts is the subject of an [[urban legend]]. The legend holds that he had been selected to host a well-known radio show as a last-minute replacement for a better known celebrity. The week before Tufts's episode was scheduled, the previous host introduced him with a combination of surprise and outrage, shocked that a relatively unknown actor would succeed him as host. There is no evidence, however, that such an incident occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/radio/sonnytufts.asp|title=Sonny Tufts?|date=March 16, 2010|publisher=snopes.com|accessdate=June 1, 2014}}</ref> Tufts himself parodied this legend in frequent appearances on ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'': seated in a director's chair with his name printed on it, he would turn around to face the camera and utter a word or phrase relevant to the previous bit, in mock contempt.

Years after Tuft's death, during the 1980s, he became known as one of the semi-random people and places that TV host [[Johnny Carson]] used in his jokes on ''[[The Tonight Show]]''.
