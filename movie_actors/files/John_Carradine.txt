'''John Carradine''' (born '''Richmond Reed Carradine'''; February 5, 1906&nbsp;– November 27, 1988) was an American actor, best known for his roles in [[horror film]]s and [[Westerns]] as well as [[Shakespeare]]an theatre.  A member of [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s stock company and later [[John Ford]]'s company, he was one of the most prolific [[character actor]]s in [[Hollywood]] history. He was married four times, had five children and was the patriarch of the [[Carradine family]], including four of his sons and four of his grandchildren who are or were also actors.

==Early life==
John Carradine was born in the [[Greenwich Village]] section of the [[Manhattan]] borough of [[New York City]], son of William Reed Carradine, a correspondent for the [[Associated Press]], and his wife Dr. Genevieve Winnifred Richmond, a surgeon.<ref name= Krebs>Krebs, Albin. "John Carradine, Actor, Dies; appeared in Numerous Roles", ''New York Times,'' November 29, 1988.</ref><ref name=filmref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/50/John-Carradine.html Filmreference.com: John Carradine].</ref> He was primarily of Irish descent.<ref>http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/david-carradines-widow-files-wrongful-death-suit/story?id=10825994</ref> William Carradine was the son of [[evangelical]] author [[Beverly Carradine]]. The family lived in [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]] and [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name = Beaver>Beaver, Jim. "John Carradine", ''Films in Review,'' October 1979.</ref> William Carradine died from [[tuberculosis]] when his son John was two years old. Carradine's mother then married "a [[Philadelphia]] paper manufacturer named Peck, who thought the way to bring up someone else's boy was to beat him every day just on general principle."<ref name= "Endless Highway">Carradine, David. ''Endless Highway''(1995) Journey Publishing</ref> Carradine attended the Christ Church School in Kingston<ref name = Beaver /> and the [[Episcopal Academy]] in [[Merion Station, Pennsylvania]], where he developed his diction and his memory while memorizing portions of the ''Episcopal Book of Common Prayer'' as a punishment.<ref name= "Endless Highway" />

Carradine's son, [[David Carradine|David]], claimed his father ran away when he was 14 years old. He later returned, as he studied sculpture at Philadelphia's Graphic Arts Institute.<ref name = Beaver /> Carradine lived with his maternal uncle, Peter Richmond, in New York City for a while, working in the film archives of the public library.  David said that while still a teenager, his father went to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]], to serve as an apprentice to [[Daniel Chester French]], the sculptor who created the statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the [[Lincoln Monument]] (see notes). He traveled for a time, supporting himself painting portraits. "If the sitter was satisfied, the price was $2.50," he once said. "It cost him nothing if he thought it was a turkey. I made as high as $10 to $15 a day."<ref name= Krebs /> During this time, he was arrested for [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]]. While in jail, Carradine was beaten, suffering a broken nose that did not set correctly.  This contributed to "the look that would become world famous."<ref name= "Endless Highway" />

David Carradine said, "My dad told me that he saw a production of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' when he was eleven years old and decided right then what he wanted to do with his life".<ref name= "Endless Highway" /> He made his stage debut in 1925 in [[New Orleans]] in a production of ''[[The Lady of the Camellias|Camille]]'' and worked for a time in a New Orleans [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] company.<ref name = Beaver />  Carradine joined a tent repertory theater under the management of R. D. MaClean, who became his mentor. In 1927, he took a job escorting a shipment of bananas from [[Dallas, Texas]] to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]],<ref name = Beaver /> where he eventually picked up some theater work under the name of Peter Richmond, in homage to his uncle. He became friends with [[John Barrymore]], and began working for [[Cecil B. DeMille]] as a set designer. Carradine, however, did not have the job long.  "DeMille noticed the lack of Roman columns in my sketches," Carradine said. "I lasted two weeks."<ref name = Beaver /> Once DeMille heard his baritone voice, however, he hired him to do voice-overs.  Carradine said, "...the great Cecil B. DeMille saw an apparition - me - pass him by, reciting the gravedigger's lines from '[[Hamlet]],' and he instructed me to report to him the following day."<ref name= Krebs /> He became a member of DeMille's stock company and his voice was heard in several DeMille pictures, including ''[[The Sign of the Cross (film)|The Sign of the Cross]]''.

==Career==
[[File:John CarradineThe Hurricane Trailer screenshot.jpg|right|thumb|Screenshot from ''[[The Hurricane (1937 film)|The Hurricane]]'' (1937)]]
Carradine's first film credit was ''Tol'able David'' (1930), but he claimed to have done 70 pictures before getting billing. Carradine claimed to have tested, as an unknown - along with well-known leading men [[Conrad Veidt]], [[William Courtenay (actor)|William Courtenay]], [[Paul Muni]], and [[Ian Keith]] - for the title role in ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'', but the historical record does not support the claim. The part eventually went to [[Bela Lugosi]]. Carradine would later play the Count in the [[Universal Studios]] Dracula sequels ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[House of Dracula]]''. Carradine also claimed to have tested for the monster role in ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein (1931)]]'',<ref name = Beaver /> though again, there is no account other than his own that he actually did so.  By 1933, he was being credited as John Peter Richmond, perhaps in honor of his friend, John Barrymore.<ref name= "Endless Highway" /> He adopted the stage name "John Carradine" in 1935, and legally took the name as his own two years later.

By 1936, Carradine had become a member of [[John Ford]]'s stock company and appeared in ''[[The Prisoner of Shark Island]]''. In total, he made 11 pictures with Ford, including his first important role, as Preacher Casy in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940), which starred [[Henry Fonda]].<ref name= Krebs />  Other Ford films in which Carradine appeared include''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962) and ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939), both with [[John Wayne]].

[[File:Grapes of Wrath, The - (Original Trailer) - 03.png|thumb|left|As preacher Casy in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940)]]
He also portrayed the [[Bible|Biblical]] hero [[Aaron]] in DeMille's ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), and he dominated ''[[Hitler's Madman]]'' (1943) as [[Reinhard Heydrich]].

Carradine did considerable stage work, much of which provided his only opportunity to work in a classic drama context. He toured with his own Shakespearean company in the 1940s, playing [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] and [[Macbeth (character)|Macbeth]]. His [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] roles included Ferdinand in a 1946 production of [[John Webster]]'s ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'', the Ragpicker in a 13-month run of [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s ''[[The Madwoman of Chaillot]]'', Lycus in a 15-month run of ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', and DeLacey in the expensive one-night flop ''Frankenstein'' in 1981. He also toured in road companies of such shows as ''[[Tobacco Road]]'' and ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]],'' in which he was properly emaciated as the [[cancer]]-ridden Big Daddy, a part, he said, which [[Tennessee Williams]] wrote for him.<ref name = Beaver />

Carradine claimed to have appeared in more than 450 movies, but only 225 movies can be documented. His count is closer to fact if theatrical movies, made-for-TV movies and television programs are included.<ref name = Beaver /><ref>Carradine interview, ''Dick Cavett Show'', 1977..</ref><ref>Weaver, Tom. ''John Carradine: The Films'', McFarland & Co., 1999.</ref> He often played eccentric, insane or diabolical characters, especially in the [[horror film|horror]] genre with which he had become identified as a "star" by the mid-1940s. He occasionally played a heroic role, as in ''The Grapes of Wrath'', in which he played Casy, the ill-fated "preacher", and he occasionally played a sympathetic role, as in ''[[Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake]]'', in which he played Blake's shipmate, who escapes with him to a tropical island full of riches.

He appeared in dozens of low-budget horror films from the 1940s onwards, in order to finance a touring classical theatre company. He sang the theme song to one film in which he appeared briefly, ''[[Red Zone Cuba]]''. He also made more than one hundred television appearances, including [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s ''[[My Friend Flicka (TV series)|My Friend Flicka]]'', ''[[Johnny Ringo (TV series)|Johnny Ringo]]'' (as "The Rain Man"), and ''[[Place the Face]]'', [[NBC]]'s ''[[Cimarron City (TV series)|Cimarron City]]'' as the foreboding Jared Tucker in the episode "Child of Fear" and on [[William Bendix]]'s ''[[Overland Trail (TV series)|Overland Trail]]'' in the 1960 episode "The Reckoning," on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Harrigan and Son]]'', ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'', and ''[[The Legend of Jesse James (TV series)|The Legend of Jesse James]]'', and on the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] adventure series, ''[[Rescue 8]]'', with [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]].

Carradine made recurring appearances as the [[mortician]], Mr. Gateman, on CBS' ''[[The Munsters]]''. Carradine also appeared in both of Irwin Allen's classic 1960's science-fiction TV series "Lost In Space" and "Land Of The Giants."  In 1985, Carradine won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for his performance as an eccentric old man who lives by the railroad tracks in the Young People's Special, ''Umbrella Jack''.

In 1982, he supplied the voice of the Great Owl in the animated feature ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''. One of Carradine's final film appearances was ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'' in 1986. Carradine's last released film credit was ''Bikini Drive-In'', released years after his death.

Carradine's deep, resonant voice earned him the nickname "The Voice". He was also known as the "Bard of the Boulevard," due to his idiosyncratic habit of strolling [[Hollywood]] streets while reciting Shakespearean [[soliloquy|soliloquies]], something he always denied.<ref name = Beaver />

==Personal life and death==
Carradine was married four times. He married his first wife, Ardanelle McCool Cosner (1911-1989), in 1935. She was mother of [[Bruce Carradine|Bruce]] and [[David Carradine|David]].<ref name = Beaver /> John adopted Bruce, Ardanelle's son from a previous marriage. John had planned a large family but, according to the autobiography of his son David, after Ardanelle had had a series of miscarriages, Carradine discovered that she had had repeated "coat hanger" [[abortion]]s, without his knowledge, which rendered her unable to carry a baby to full term.<ref name= "Endless Highway" /> After only three years of marriage, Ardenelle Carradine filed for divorce, but the couple remained married for another five years.<ref>"Sued for Divorce", ''Desert News,'' Feb. 4, 1945, p. 8</ref>

They divorced in 1944, when David was seven years old.  Carradine left California to avoid court action in the [[alimony]] settlement.<ref>"Mrs. Carradine Pushes Action Against Actor", (September 4, 1945) ''Los Angeles Times'' A12</ref><ref name ="Bee">"Actor Goes Free Pending Hearing on Old Charge", (September 5, 1953) ''The Modesto Bee,'' Pg. 4</ref><ref>"Carradine Flies East After Court Victory", ''Los Angeles Times'', (August 17, 1946) pp. A1</ref> After the couple engaged in a series of court battles involving child custody and alimony, which at one point landed Carradine in jail,<ref name ="Bee"/> David joined his father in New York City. By this time his father had remarried. For the next few years David was shuffled between boarding schools, foster homes and reform school.<ref name="FOX Bio">[http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2009/06/04/fast-facts-david-carradine-biography/ David Carradine Biography]. FOX. Updated June 4, 2009</ref>

Carradine married Sonia Sorel (1921-2004), who had appeared with him in ''[[Bluebeard (1944 film)|Bluebeard]]'' (1944) immediately following his divorce from Ardanelle in 1945. Sonia, who had adopted the stage name of Sorel, was the daughter of San Francisco brewer, Henry Henius, granddaughter of biochemist [[Max Henius]], and a great-niece of the historian [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]].<ref name= Sarasota>35-year-old Actress and Young Artist Wed. ''Sarasota Journal''. May 13, 1957</ref> Together she and Carradine had three sons, Christopher, [[Keith Carradine|Keith]] and [[Robert Carradine|Robert]]. Their divorce in 1957<ref name= Sarasota /> was followed by an acrimonious custody battle, which resulted in their sons being placed in a home for [[child abuse|abused children]] as wards of the court. Keith Carradine said of the experience, "It was like being in jail. There were bars on the windows, and we were only allowed to see our parents through glass doors. It was very sad. We would stand there on either side of the glass door crying".<ref>Deihl, Digby, "Getting Personal With Keith Carradine", ''Boca Raton News', November 4, 1984, Pg.99</ref>

Eventually, Carradine won custody of the children. For the next eight years, Sonia was not permitted to see the children.<ref>Wadler, Joyce. "Keith Carradine's Long Road to 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' ", ''New York Times'', July 23, 2006</ref> Robert Carradine said that he was raised primarily by his stepmother, his father's third wife, Doris (Rich) Grimshaw, and believed her to be his mother until he was introduced to Sonia Sorel at a Christmas party when he was 14 years old. He told a journalist, "I said, 'How do you do.' Keith took me aside and said 'That's our real mother.' I didn't know what he was talking about. But he finally convinced me."<ref name= Vernon>Scott, Vernon. "Young Robert May Top All Carradines", ''Sarasota Herald'', Feb. 22, 1978, pg. 7B</ref>

When John Carradine married Doris (Erving Rich) Grimshaw<ref>Oxnard (CA) ''Press-Courier'', May 18, 1971, p. 1</ref> in 1957, she already had a son from a previous marriage, Dale, and a son from a later relationship, Michael, both of whom, along with Sonia Sorel's son, [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]], are sometimes counted among John Carradine's eight sons.<ref>Kleiner, Dick. "Carradines: 8 Sons, 2 Dads, 3 Moms", ''The Sumter Daily Item'', June 1, 1982, pg 10</ref> She was a one-time studio typist who typed the script to ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' and who went on to play a few roles in film and television.<ref>Oxnard (CA) ''Press-Courier'', May 18, 1971 p. 2</ref> Doris died in 1971 in a fire in her apartment in [[Oxnard, California]]. The fire was caused by a burning cigarette. She had been rescued from a similar fire just two weeks earlier. At the time of her death, she and Carradine were separated.<ref>''Rome News-Tribune'', May 19, 1971, pg. 1</ref> Carradine was married a fourth time, from 1975 to 1988, to Emily Cisneros, who survived him.<ref name=filmref />

Retired, Carradine suffered from painful and crippling [[Rheumatoid Arthritis|arthritis]], before he died from multiple [[organ failure]] at Fatebenefratelli Hospital in [[Milan, Italy]] on November 27, 1988. Hours before he was stricken, he had climbed the 328 steep steps of Milan's [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedral, the ''Duomo''. According to David Carradine, he had just finished a film in South Africa and was about to begin a European tour. David was with him, reading Shakespeare to him, when he succumbed to his condition.<ref>Valsecchi, Peiro. "Actor John Carradine dead at 82", ''Times-News,'' November 27, 1988</ref> By the time David and Keith Carradine had arrived at their father's bedside, he was unable to speak. "I was told that his last words were 'Milan: What a beautiful place to die.'" David recalled, "but he never spoke to me or opened his eyes.  When he died, I was holding him in my arms. I reached out and closed his eyes. It's not as easy as it is in the movies."<ref name= "Endless Highway"/> There was a [[Requiem Mass]] for John Carradine at [[St. Thomas the Apostle Hollywood]].  [[Jane Fonda]] was among those in attendance. An [[Irish wake]] followed and eventually he was buried at sea.<ref name= "Endless Highway"/>

===Legacy===

David had a prolific career, amassing 227 movie and television credits by the time of his death in 2009. He also had a brief Broadway career and produced and directed a number of independent projects. His success often led to work for other members of his family, including his father. The two appeared together in a few films, including ''[[The Good Guys and the Bad Guys]]'' (1969) and ''[[Boxcar Bertha]]'' (1972), which was produced by [[Roger Corman]] and directed by [[Martin Scorsese]].

David's television series, ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', featured his father John and half-brother Robert in the episode "Dark Angel". John would appear as the same character, the Reverend Serenity Johnson, in two more episodes: "The Nature of Evil" and "Ambush". David's brothers Bruce and Keith also appeared in the series, with Keith playing David's character as a teenager for a brief period. David, Keith, and Robert appeared together in a humorous cameo on ''[[The Fall Guy]]'', on an episode called "[[October the 31st (The Fall Guy episode)|October the 31st]]" in which their father co-starred.

Robert appeared with his father in an episode of the first ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' revival television series in 1986. The episode segment titled "[[Still Life (The Twilight Zone)|Still Life]]" featured Robert as a photographer who discovers an unusual camera and his father as a college professor who helps him discover the camera's secret.
