'''Andrea Arnold''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 5 April 1961) is an English filmmaker and former actress, who made her feature film directorial debut in 2006 with ''[[Red Road (film)|Red Road]]''.

==Personal life==
Arnold was born on 5 April 1961 in [[Dartford]], Kent, where she was the eldest of four children. She was born when her mother was only 16 years old and her father was 17, and they separated when she was very young. Her mother had to bring up all four children alone, which is reminiscent of Arnold's own directorial debuted short, ''Wasp''. When people are asked if the story is in any way biographical, Arnold replies "I grew up in a working class family, so I guess you could say I write from what I know."<ref name="scotsman1">{{cite news|title=Film: Andrea Arnold Interview|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/film-andrea-arnold-interview-1-1355790|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=Scotsmans|date=28 August 2009}}</ref> Even as a young girl, she was writing dark stories about human experience. In an interview, Arnold speaks about how when she was a mere 10 years old, she wrote her first play that expressed her "horror" of the slave trade, and a few years later while studying for a dance GCSE, she made a performance piece; "I took quotes from the Diary of Anne Frank and read them aloud as I moved around the room. All the other kids would just bung on some pop music and dance. I remember the examiners sitting there looking at me, perplexed."<ref name="secher1">{{cite news|last=Secher|first=Benjamin|title=Dark depths of Andrea Arnold's Wuthering Heights|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmmakersonfilm/8870091/Dark-depths-of-Andrea-Arnolds-Wuthering-Heights.html|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=5 November 2011}}</ref> Arnold left high school when she was 16, when she was drawn to becoming an actress.<ref name="scotsman1"/> When Arnold was 18 years old she left Kent for London where she began working as a host and actress for a children's TV show called "No. 73". She worked in TV for the next 10 years, while continually writing on the side. She began scripting her youth oriented environmental series titled "A Beetle Called Derek" in the mid-1990s, where she began to yearn to direct.<ref name="scotsman1"/> Arnold realised she could turn her stories into films, so she studied at the American Film Institute of Los Angeles where she gained experience in the film industry. After finishing school and returning to Britain she had daughter, Coral, with her long-time boyfriend, Alex,<ref name="scotsman1"/> who is a software engineer, and began making short films for TV.<ref>{{cite news|last=Winters|first=Laura|title=Director Leaps From Shorts to Longing|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/movies/01wint.html?_r=1|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 April 2007}}</ref>

==Early TV work==
After leaving school in the late 1970s, Arnold got her first TV jobs as a dancer on shows that included ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/oct/18/londonfilmfestival2006.londonfilmfestival1 "I like darkness"] ''The Guardian'' (18 October 2006). Retrieved 10 May 2010.</ref> She first came to prominence as an actress and television presenter alongside [[Sandi Toksvig]], Nick Staverson and [[Neil Buchanan]] in the 1980s children's television show ''[[No. 73]]''. This Saturday morning show on [[ITV Network|ITV]], in which she played Dawn Lodge, had a similar premise to that of ''[[The Kumars at No. 42]]'' in the way that the show was part sitcom, part chat show and based at a domestic residence. In addition to these parts, the show had the usual mix of music, competitions and cartoons (such as [[Roger Ramjet]]) that was in keeping to the formula of British Saturday morning children's TV of the 1980s. After a couple of years of experience in front of the camera, Arnold realised, "Television was great fun and I went along for the ride, but I never felt that comfortable in front of the camera".<ref name="secher1"/>

In 1988 No. 73 had morphed into ''[[7T3]]'', with the set being moved from the [[Maidstone]] house (in fact in [[Television South|TVS]] studios in [[Kent]]) to that of a theme park. This revamp would only last the season, but Arnold would be seen for another two years in the same timeslot as part of the ''[[Motormouth]]'' presenting team. In 1990 she presented and wrote for the environmental awareness show for teens, ''A Beetle Called Derek''. This also featured [[Benjamin Zephaniah]] and gave exposure to [[The Yes/No People]] of [[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp]] fame.

==Directing==
After retiring from her career as a television presenter, Arnold studied directing at the [[AFI Conservatory]] in Los Angeles and trained in screenwriting at the PAL Labs in [[Kent]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/Conservatory/alumni/alumni.aspx|title=AFI Conservatory Alumni|accessdate=31 July 2011|work=AFI Conservatory| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110706075549/http://www.afi.com/Conservatory/alumni/alumni.aspx| archivedate= 6 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/foreignc/2011/02/afis-class-of-92.html |title=The AFI Class of '92|accessdate=31 July 2011|work=Chicago Sun Times|first=Uploaded|last=By}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pallabs.org/portfolio/timeline/november_2003_screenwriters_lab/|title=PAL Screenwriters Lab|accessdate=31 July 2011|work=PAL Labs}}</ref> Her early short films included ''Milk'' (1998) and ''Dog'' (2001). She won the [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]] for [[Wasp (film)|''Wasp'']], in 2003.<ref>{{cite news |title=Real life in the Fish Tank |first=Amy |last=Raphael |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/aug/23/andrea-arnold-fish-tank-cannes |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 August 2009 |accessdate=1 December 2011 |location=London}}</ref> She was also named a [[Screen International#Screen International Stars of Tomorrow|''Screen International'' Star of Tomorrow]].

''[[Red Road (film)|Red Road]]'' is the first instalment of [[Advance Party (film series)|Advance Party]], a planned set of three conceptually-related films by different first-time directors. Set on a [[housing estate]] in Glasgow, the [[revenge]]-themed story centres on a [[Closed-circuit television camera|CCTV]] (security TV cameras) operator who develops an obsession with someone she observes, for reasons that become clear through the progress of the film. The picture has won the British director comparisons with established names such as [[Michael Haneke]] and [[Lars von Trier]]. ''Screen International'' critic Allan Hunter said the film was "likely to emerge as one of the discoveries of this year's [[2006 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] (2006)."<ref>[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/22052006/325/europe-eclipses-hollywood-hot-year-cannes.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref> It went on to win the Jury Prize at Cannes that year.<ref name="cannes-2006.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4359479/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Red Road |accessdate=13 December 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref>

Arnold won the 2007 [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer]] for directing ''Red Road''.

In 2008, Arnold was reported to be directing an adaptation of [[Gillian Flynn]]'s novel ''[[Sharp Objects]]'' for French production company [[Pathé]], but the project never materialized.<ref>{{cite web|title=Forward, Slingshot start shooting UK school horror Tormented|url=http://www.screendaily.com/forward-slingshot-start-shooting-uk-school-horror-tormented/4040179.article|publisher=Screen Daily|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref>

Her 2009 film ''[[Fish Tank (film)|Fish Tank]]'' premiered at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival|62nd Cannes Film Festival]],<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.cannes-2009.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/10902591/year/2009.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Fish Tank |accessdate=9 May 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> where she once again won the Jury Prize. The film also went on to win the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film]] in 2010.

In 2011 Arnold completed shooting an adaptation of [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights (2011 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'', produced by London's [[Ecosse Films]]. The film was shown in competition at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]] in September<ref name="Venice">{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/lineup/off-sel/venezia68/ |title=Venezia 68: International competition of feature films |accessdate=31 July 2011|work=Venice}}</ref> where it won the [[Golden Osella]] for Best Cinematography.

She was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to the film industry.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59647 |date=31 December 2010 |startpage=9 |supp=yes }}</ref>

In all her films there are some common themes that Arnold chooses to use to propel the narrative. Since childhood, Arnold has been interested in human psychology and the human experience. She has said "I am obsessed with why people turn out the way they are".<ref name="secher1"/>

===''Wasp''===
Initially released in 2003, ''Wasp'' was a short (26 minutes) written and directed by Arnold. Released in 2003, it stars [[Natalie Press]] as a struggling single mother determined not to let her four young children prove an obstacle in the pursuit of rekindling a relationship with an old ex-boyfriend ([[Danny Dyer]]). Dartford (Arnold's hometown) is the setting. The film was commissioned by the UK Film Council and the Britain's [[Channel 4]]. It won the Sundance Short Film Prize in 2005, and won Arnold an [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Arnold Congratulated on Oscar Win|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4304943.stm|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=28 February 2005}}</ref>

===''Red Road''===
''Red Road'' was a 2006 film that is a part of a creative series proposed by the Advance Party of Filmmakers to create three films using the same characters, all directed by different new directors. It tells the story of a [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] security operator who observes through her monitors a man from her past. It is named after, and partly set at, the [[Red Road (flats)|Red Road flats]] in [[Barmulloch]], Glasgow, [[Scotland]] which were the tallest residential buildings in Europe at the time they were built.<ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/springher/springher17.htm Red Road Flats], Glasgow Digital Library</ref> It is shot largely in a [[Dogme 95]] style, using handheld cameras and natural light.

One rule was that if any of the directors decide to incorporate a new main character, then all of the other films must incorporate that character as well. All three directors cast together so they could all see who they believed would fit their film as well as the others. Arnold mainly used first time actors, stating that "I always want the world that I create to be its own universe. When you have really famous people, I find that it is very hard to transcend that awareness. I am always aware of who they are. When you see someone for the first time, that universe feels even more real. I like the idea of working with either unknowns or people that haven't even acted before."<ref>{{cite web|last=GreenCineStaff|title=Andrea Arnold: The Path to ''The Red Road''|url=http://www.greencine.com/central/andreaarnold?page=0%2C2|publisher=GreenCine|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> ''Red Road'' cost $1 million to make<ref name="gritten1">{{cite news|last=Gritten|first=David|title=Andrea Arnold: 'I wish cinema could be braver'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/6093303/Andrea-Arnold-I-wish-cinema-could-be-braver.html|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=28 August 2009}}</ref> and was shot digitally on a schedule of six weeks. The film was accepted into competition for the Palme d'Or in [[Cannes]] and received the Jury Prize.

===''Fish Tank''===
''Fish Tank'' premiered in 2009 and was accepted into competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and received the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]].<ref name="gritten1"/> In its initial production, distributor [[Artificial Eye]] had acquired the UK theatrical rights, while ContentFilm International handled the worldwide sales. The film was backed by the Limelight Fund, [[BBC Films]] and the [[UK Film Council]]'s New Cinema Fund.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mitchell|first=Wendy|title=Andrea Arnold starts UK shoot for ''Fish Tank''|url=http://www.screendaily.com/andrea-arnold-starts-uk-shoot-for-fish-tank/4040054.article|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=Screen Daily|date=28 July 2008}}</ref> The film was shot entirely on location in the UK.<ref>{{cite news|title=Andrea Arnold's Fish Tank Confirmed For Cannes Competition|url=http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=92613|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=4RFV|date=24 April 2009}}</ref> Arnold was adamant about shooting the film in chronological order, so that the journey of the film would make sense to new coming actor Katie Jarvis. She would only give her a day's worth of script to study so that she could take it day by day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fish Tank wins the Outstanding British Film BAFTA|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyOicyr9eco|work=YOUTUBE|accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref> The film originally premiered on around 45–50 screens in Britain, making them less accessible to the general public. In regards to this, Arnold said, "I definitely feel sorry more people don't get to see my films. They aren't inaccessible, and if people got the chance to see them, I know they'd like them. I wish cinema [owners] could be braver, or had more money to help them show films like mine." The film cost around $2 million to make, which is still a relatively low budget for a feature-length film.<ref name="gritten1"/> Fish Tank won many awards including the best film award at the Evening Standard Film Awards.<ref name="masters1">{{cite news|last=Masters|first=Tim|title=Andrea Arnold on 'huge responsibility' of Bronte film|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8508155.stm|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=11 February 2010}}</ref> Fish Tank was released on 11 September 2009.<ref name="scotsman1"/> The film and Arnold were honoured at the 20th Annual Women in Film and TV Awards in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kemp|first=Stuart|title=Carey Mulligan, Andrea Arnold, Jane Goldman Among Women in Film and TV Honorees|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/carey-mulligan-andrea-arnold-jane-55965|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=3 December 2012}}</ref>

===''Wuthering Heights''===
Arnold's recent film based on [[Emily Brontë]]'s novel of 1847 stars [[Kaya Scodelario]] and James Howson. This is the first film that Arnold has directed which she did not write herself, though she did co-write the screenplay. Originally, the film adaptation was set to be directed by Peter Webber, who directed ''Girl with a Pearl Earring'', but Arnold was asked to take over and gladly accepted.<ref name="masters1"/> The film was made in 18 months, which is half the amount of time Arnold used to make Red Road and Fish Tank.<ref name="secher1"/> [[Oscilloscope Laboratories]] picked up the North American distribution rights to the adaptation, which won Best Cinematography at the Venice Film Festival in 2011, being praised for its visuals.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Toronto 2011: Oscilloscope Acquires Andrea Arnold's 'Wuthering Heights'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/toronto-2011-oscilloscope-acquires-andrea-235543|accessdate=5 May 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=14 September 2001}}</ref>
