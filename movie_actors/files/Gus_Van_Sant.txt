'''Gus Green Van Sant, Jr.'''<ref name="filmr"/> (born July 24, 1952) is an American film director, screenwriter, painter, photographer, musician and author. He is a two-time nominee of the [[Academy Award for Best Director]]—for the drama ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' (1997) and the biopic ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' (2008), both of which were also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. He won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] for his drama ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'' (2003), which was inspired by the [[Columbine High School massacre]].<ref name="cannes-2003.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4071982/year/2003.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Elephant |accessdate=2009-11-05|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> He lives in [[Portland, Oregon]].

His early career was devoted to directing television commercials in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. In his films, he has dealt with themes concerning homosexuality and other marginalized subcultures. His filmography as writer and director includes the 1993 [[comedy-drama]]-[[romance film]] [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|adaptation]] of [[Tom Robbins]]' 1976 novel ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (book)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'', which features a diverse cast ([[Keanu Reeves]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[Uma Thurman]] and [[k.d. lang]], with cameos by [[William S. Burroughs]] and [[Heather Graham (actress)|Heather Graham]], among others); and the indie drama ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991), also starring Reeves as well as [[River Phoenix]].

He wrote the screenplays for most of his early movies, and wrote one novel, [[Pink (Van Sant Novel)|''Pink'']].<ref>Gus Van Sant, ''Pink'', Faber & Faber, 1998, ISBN 0-385-49353-3</ref> A book of his photography has also been published, called ''108 Portraits''.<ref>Gus Van Sant, ''108 Portraits'', Twin Palms Pub., 1993, ISBN 0-944092-22-5</ref>

==Early life==
Van Sant was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], the son of Betty (née Seay) and Gus Green Van Sant, Sr; Gus Van Sant's father was a clothing manufacturer<ref name="filmr">{{cite web|title=Gus Van Sant Biography (1952?-)|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/20/Gus-Van-Sant.html|work=film reference|publisher=Advameg, Inc|accessdate=August 15, 2012|author=film reference|year=2012}}</ref> and traveling salesman who rapidly worked his way into middle class prosperity. As a result of his father's job, the family moved continually during Van Sant's childhood.

Van Sant is an alumnus of [[Darien High School]] in Connecticut, US,<ref>{{cite web|title=Darien High School|url=http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/15519|work=Public School Review|publisher=Public School Review|accessdate=September 24, 2012|year=2003–2012}}</ref> and [[The Catlin Gabel School]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], US.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gus Van Sant- Biography|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/person/gus-van-sant/biography.html|work=Yahoo! Movies|publisher=Yahoo!, Inc|accessdate=September 24, 2012|year=2012}}</ref> One constant in the director's early years was his interest in visual arts (namely, painting and [[Super-8]] filmmaking); while still in school he began making semi-autobiographical shorts costing between 30 and 50 dollars. Van Sant's artistic leanings took him to the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] in 1970,<ref>{{cite web|title=Rhode Island School of Design (RISD)|url=http://www.campusexplorer.com/colleges/5C444AC3/Rhode-Island/Providence/Rhode-Island-School-of-Design/|work=Campus Explorer|publisher=Campus Explorer, Inc|accessdate=September 24, 2012|year=2012}}</ref> where his classmates included [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] and other members of [[Talking Heads]]. It was also at RISD that Van Sant received an introduction to [[avant-garde]] directors like [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Jonas Mekas]] and [[Andy Warhol]]; this introduction quickly inspired him to change his major from painting to cinema.

==Early career (1978–1989)==
After spending time in Europe, Van Sant went to Los Angeles in 1976.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1548269/Gus-van-Sant/biography | work=The New York Times | title=Gus van Sant}}</ref> He secured a job as a production assistant to writer/director [[Ken Shapiro]], with whom he developed a few ideas, none of which came to fruition. In 1981, Van Sant made ''Alice in Hollywood'', a film about a naïve young actress who goes to Hollywood and abandons her ideals. It was never released. During this period, Van Sant began to spend time observing the denizens of the more down-and-out sections of [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. He became fascinated by the existence of this marginalized section of L.A.'s population, especially in context with the more ordinary, prosperous world that surrounded them. Van Sant would repeatedly focus his work on those existing on society's fringes, beginning with his 1985 film ''[[Mala Noche]]''.

''Mala Noche'' was made two years after Van Sant went to New York to work in an advertising agency. He saved $20,000 during his tenure there, enabling him to finance the majority of his tale of doomed love between a gay liquor store clerk and a Mexican immigrant. The film, which was taken from Portland street writer [[Walt Curtis]]' semi-autobiographical novella, featured some of the director's hallmarks, notably an unfulfilled romanticism, a dry sense of the absurd, and the refusal to treat homosexuality as something deserving of judgment. Unlike many gay filmmakers, Van Sant—who had long been [[Coming out|openly]] gay—declined to use same-sex relationships as fodder for overtly political statements, although such relationships would frequently appear in his films.

Shot in black-and-white, ''Mala Noche'' earned its director almost overnight acclaim on the festival circuit, with the ''Los Angeles Times'' naming it the year's Best [[Independent Film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gus-van-sant-411096 |title=Gus Van Sant : Biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=2014-08-04}}</ref> The film's success attracted Hollywood interest, and Van Sant was briefly courted by [[Universal Studios|Universal]]; the courtship ended after Van Sant pitched a series of project ideas (including what would later become ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' and ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'') that the studio declined to take interest in.

Van Sant moved back to [[Portland, Oregon]], where he set up house and began giving life to the ideas rejected by Universal. With the assistance of independent production company ''Avenue'', the director made ''Drugstore Cowboy'', his 1989 film about four drug addicts who rob pharmacies to support their habit. ''Cowboy'' met with great critical success; in addition to furthering Van Sant's reputation as a gifted director, it helped to revive the career of [[Matt Dillon]], who played the junkie leader of the gang.

==Indie and arthouse success (1990–1995)==
''Drugstore Cowboy'''s exploration of the lives of those living on society's outer fringes, as well as its [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] setting, were mirrored in Van Sant's next effort, the similarly acclaimed ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'' (1991). Only with the success of ''Cowboy'' was Van Sant now given license to make ''Idaho'' (a project he had originally pitched but was knocked back several times as the script was deemed 'too risky' by studios). Now [[New Line Cinema]] had given Van Sant the green light, he was on a mission to get the ''Idaho'' script to his first choices for his two young leads. After months of struggle with agents and managers over the content of the script, Van Sant finally secured [[River Phoenix]] and [[Keanu Reeves]] in the roles of Mike Waters and Scott Favor. Centering around the dealings of two male hustlers (played by Phoenix and Reeves), the film was a compelling examination of unrequited love, alienation, and the concept of family (a concept Van Sant repeatedly explores in his films). The film won him an [[Independent Spirit Award]] for his screenplay (he had won the same award for his ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' screenplay), as well as greater prestige. The film also gained River Phoenix best actor honors at the [[Venice Film Festival]] among others. In addition, it helped Reeves—previously best known for his work in the ''[[Bill and Ted]]'' movies—to get the critical respect that had previously eluded him.

Van Sant's next project, a 1993 [[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|adaptation]] of [[Tom Robbins]]' ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (novel)|Even Cowgirls Get the Blues]]'', was an excessive flop, both commercially and critically. Featuring an unusually large budget (for Van Sant, at least) of $8.5 million and a large, eclectic cast including [[Uma Thurman]], [[John Hurt]], Keanu Reeves and a newcomer in the form of River Phoenix's younger sister [[Rain Phoenix|Rain]] (at Phoenix's suggestion), the film was worked and then reworked, but the finished product nonetheless resulted in something approaching a significant disaster.

Van Sant's 1995 film ''[[To Die For]]'' helped to restore his luster. An adaptation of [[Joyce Maynard]]'s novel, the [[black comedy]] starred [[Nicole Kidman]] as a murderously ambitious weather girl; it also featured Van Sant favorite [[Matt Dillon]] as her hapless husband and, the third Phoenix sibling in as many projects, [[Joaquin Phoenix]], as her equally hapless lover (River had died from a drug overdose a year and half earlier). It was Van Sant's first effort for a major studio ([[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]), and its success paved the way for further projects of the director's choosing. The same year, he served as executive producer for [[Larry Clark]]'s ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]''; it was a fitting assignment, due to both the film's subject matter and the fact that Clark's photographs of junkies had served as reference points for Van Sant's ''Drugstore Cowboy''.

==Mainstream breakout (1997–2003)==
In 1997, Van Sant gained mainstream acceptance thanks to ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', starring and written by [[Matt Damon]] and [[Ben Affleck]]. The film—about a troubled, blue-collar mathematical genius—was a huge critical and commercial success. In addition to taking in more than $220 million worldwide, it received a number of [[Academy Award]] nominations, including a Best Director nomination for Van Sant. It won a Best Screenplay [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for Damon and Affleck, and a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for [[Robin Williams]], who, in his acceptance speech, referred to Van Sant as "the mellowest man in Hollywood." Van Sant, Damon and Affleck parodied themselves and the film's success in [[Kevin Smith]]'s'' [[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]''.

The success of ''Good Will Hunting'' afforded Van Sant the opportunity to [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] classic ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. As opposed to reinterpreting the 1960 film, Van Sant opted to recreate the film shot-for-shot, in color, with a cast of young Hollywood A-listers. His decision was met with equal parts curiosity, skepticism, and derision from industry insiders and outsiders alike, and the finished result met with a similar reception. Starring [[Anne Heche]], [[Vince Vaughn]], and [[Julianne Moore]], ''Psycho'' was ultimately met with a negative critical reception and did poorly at the box office. However, Van Sant was not deterred by this, and was soon busy again with a number of projects. In addition to directing, he also devoted considerable energy to releasing two albums and publishing a novel, ''[[Pink (novel)|Pink]]'', which was a thinly veiled exploration of his grief over River Phoenix's 1993 death.

Van Sant fared somewhat better with 2000's ''[[Finding Forrester]]'', a drama about a high-school student from [[the Bronx]] ([[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]) who becomes unlikely friends with a crusty, reclusive author ([[Sean Connery]]). Critical response was mixed but generally positive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/finding_forrester/|title=Finding Forrester|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref>

==Return to arthouse cinema (2003–present) {{Anchor|Death Trilogy}}==
Van Sant traveled to the deserts of [[Argentina]], [[Utah]], and [[Death Valley]] for 2002's ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', a loosely devised, largely improvised feature in which stars Matt Damon and [[Casey Affleck]]—both playing characters named Gerry—wander through the desert, discussing ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', video games, and nothing in particular. The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].

It took ''Gerry'' over a year to make it to theaters, in which time Van Sant began production on his next film, ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]''. Approached by [[HBO]] and producer [[Diane Keaton]] to craft a fictional film based on the 1999 [[Columbine High School massacre]], the director chose to shoot in his hometown of Portland, employing dozens of untrained, teen actors. As well as melding improvisational long takes like those in ''Gerry'' with Savides' fluid camerawork, the film was also influenced by Alan Clarke's 1989 film of the same name (see ''[[Elephant (1989 film)|Elephant]]''). The finished film provoked strong reactions from audiences at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]]. At the [[Cannes]] festival, the jury awarded ''Elephant'' with their top prize, the [[Palme d'Or]], and Van Sant with his first Best Director statue from the festival.<ref name="cannes-2003.com" /> The success of ''Elephant'' led Van Sant to show the U.S. premiere of ''Elephant'' as a fundraiser for [[Outside In (organization)|Outside In]], an organization working to help youth living on the streets of [[Portland, Oregon]].

In 2005, Van Sant released ''[[Last Days (film)|Last Days]]'', the final component of what he refers to as his "Death Trilogy," (the other parts being ''Gerry'' and ''Elephant''). It is a fictionalized account of what happened to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] in the days leading up to his death. In 2006, Van Sant began work on ''[[Paranoid Park (film)|Paranoid Park]]'' based on the book by [[Blake Nelson]], about a skateboarding teenager who accidentally causes someone's death. The film was released in Europe in February 2008. He also directed the "Le Marais" segment of the omnibus film ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]''. 

Released in 2008, Van Sant's ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]'' is a biopic of [[openly gay]] San Francisco politician [[Harvey Milk]], who was assassinated in 1978, played by [[Sean Penn]]. The film received eight [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations at the [[81st Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], winning two for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] for Penn and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for writer [[Dustin Lance Black]].

==In media==
Van Sant has released two musical albums: ''Gus Van Sant'' and ''18 Songs About Golf''. The [[Broken Social Scene]] song, "Art House Director", is supposedly about Van Sant, a connection discussed by a Singaporean fan on the internet.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broken Social Scene hangs out with local bands!
