'''Ray "Crash" Corrigan''' (February 14, 1902 &ndash; August 10, 1976), born '''Raymond Benard''', was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] most famous for appearing in many [[Western (genre)|B-Western]] films. He also was a [[stuntman]] and frequently acted as [[silver screen]] gorillas in [[gorilla costume]]s that he owned, both at the beginning and end of his film career.

In 1937 Corrigan purchased land in the [[Santa Susana Mountains]] foothills in [[Simi Valley]] and developed it into a [[movie ranch]] called "[[Corriganville Movie Ranch|Corriganville]]." The [[movie ranch]] was used for [[location filming]] in film serials, feature films, and television shows, as well as for the performance of live western shows for tourists. Bob Hope later bought the ranch in 1966 and renamed it "Hopetown." It is now a Regional Park and nature preserve.<ref>[http://www.lamountains.com/parks.asp?parkid=99 "Corriganville Park."] ''LAMountains.com''. Retrieved: June 23, 2013.</ref>

==Film career==
Corrigan's career in [[Hollywood]] began as a [[Physical fitness|physical fitness instructor]] and [[physical culture]] trainer to the stars. In the early 1930s he did stunts and bit parts in several films. Many of his early roles were in ape costumes, for example, as a [[gorilla]] in ''[[Tarzan and His Mate]]'' (1934) and an "orangopoid" in the first [[Flash Gordon (serial)|''Flash Gordon'' serial]]. In [[1936 in film|1936]] Corrigan got his screen breakthrough with starring roles in two [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] serials, ''[[The Vigilantes Are Coming]]'' and in ''[[The Undersea Kingdom]]'', which evoked memories of [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]'s first "[[Flash Gordon]]" serial.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181003/ "Ray Corrigan."] ''IMDb''. Retrieved: June 23, 2013.</ref>

On the basis of this, Republic signed him to their standard Term Player Contract, running from May 25, 1936 to May 24, 1938. He was cast as one of the trio in the ''[[Three Mesquiteers]]'' series of westerns, starring in 24 of the 51 "3M" films made by the studio. He later left Republic in 1938 over a pay dispute.

Over at [[Monogram Pictures]], Corrigan began a new series of feature westerns, ''[[The Range Busters]]'', cheap knock-offs of The Three Mesquiteers, with a series character that used his name; between 1940 and 1943, he starred in 20 of the 24 films in this series.

Following this, his on-screen work largely returned to appearing in ape costumes, such as the roles in ''[[Captive Wild Woman]]'' (1943), ''[[Nabonga]]'' (1944), ''[[White Pongo]]'' (1945) and as a prehistoric sloth in ''[[Unknown Island]]'' (1948). The original gorilla "mask" seen in films like ''[[The Ape (1940 film)|The Ape]]'' (1940) was replaced with a subtler design with a more mobile jaw. Corrigan later sold his gorilla suits in 1948 and provided training in using them to their new owner, [[Steve Calvert]], a [[Ciro's]] bartender. Calvert stepped into Corrigan's paw prints starting with a [[Jungle Jim]] film. Despite reports to the contrary, Calvert and Corrigan never appeared together on-screen in an ape costume. Since both Corrigan and Calvert eschewed screen credit playing gorillas, their film credits are often confused; any appearance of the "Corrigan suit" after 1948 is by Calvert.

In 1950 he had a television show called ''Crash Corrigan's Ranch''. He also planned a television series called ''Buckskin Rangers'' with his old associate [[Max Terhune]].<ref>[http://www.jjonz.us/RadioLogs/pagesnfiles/logs_files_RH/1950s_RH/50-54/1950/50rh_10Oct/50-10-08-(Sun)_%5BLBP%5D.pdf "New Series of Westerns Planned for Television."] ''Long Beach Press-Telegram'', October 8, 1950.</ref>

Corrigan's final theatrical film was playing the title role in the [[science fiction film]] ''[[It! The Terror from Beyond Space]]'', according to bio information given to visitors at the Thousand Oaks, California, ''Corrigan Steak House and Bar'' that he once owned.

==Corriganville==
In 1937 Corrigan was on a hunting trip with [[Clark Gable]] when he had an idea to purchase land in [[Simi Valley]], [[California]] and use it as a Western ranch similar to [[Iverson Movie Ranch]]. He paid $1,000 down payment, then a thousand dollars a month until the $11,354 price was paid.<ref>Gilpatrick [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kKPcSwYtbQUC&pg=PA202 2002, p. 202.]</ref> He developed this into [[Corriganville Movie Ranch|Corriganville]], a location used for many [[Western (genre)|Western]] movies and TV shows.  The location featured many different types of terrain for producers such as lakes, mountains, and caves.<ref>Corrigan, Ray. [http://www.phantomranch.net/bwestern/corrigan.htm "An Introduction to Corriganville."] ''The Corriganville Gazette'', Volume 1, Issue 3.</ref> As opposed to merely set fronts, Corriganville contained actual buildings where film crews could live<ref>Schneider [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2sKkFbaVkRIC&pg=PA21 2007, p. 21.]</ref> and store their equipment to save time and expense wasted in daily traveling from studios to an outdoor location.

Corrigan made a lot of money from renting out this location to film studios and from paying visitors. Starting in 1949, Corrigan opened his ranch to the public on weekends for Western-themed entertainment. The weekend attractions included several stuntmen shows scheduled throughout each day, a Cavalry fort set, an outlaw shack, a full western town with saloon, jail and hotel, live western music, Indian crafts, stagecoach rides, pony rides, and boating on the ranch's artificial lake. It was common for movie and TV personalities to appear in person for photos and autographs, attracting as many as 20,000 people on those weekends.

Examples of feature films and TV shows that were filmed at Corriganville:
*''[[Drums of Fu Manchu]]'' (1939)
*''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' (1948)
*''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949–1957)
*''[[The Cisco Kid (TV series)|The Cisco Kid]]'' (1950–1956)
*''[[The Adventures of Kit Carson]]'' (1951–1955)
*''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'' (1954–1959)
*''[[Have Gun - Will Travel]]'' (1957–1963)
*''[[Casey Jones (TV series)|Casey Jones]]'' (1957)

Hollywood cowboy stars who filmed there include: [[Gene Autry]], [[Roy Rogers]], [[Buster Crabbe]], [[John Wayne]], [[Smiley Burnette]], [[Clayton Moore]], [[Jay Silverheels]], [[Charles Starrett]], [[Ken Maynard]], [[Hoot Gibson]], [[Bob Steele (actor)|Bob Steele]] and [[Tex Ritter]].

Corriganville was eventually sold to [[Bob Hope]] in 1966, at which point, it became ''Hopetown''.  Today, what is left is known as Corriganville Park and still features some of the old landmarks. Signs along a hiking trail point out the historic features.

==Nickname==
The origin of the "Crash" nickname is from his football-playing days. This was verified by Corrigan himself when he was a contestant on the June 11, 1959 episode of ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' starring [[Groucho Marx]]. When asked how he got the name "Crash", Corrigan told Groucho, "When I would go to tackle somebody or instead of fighting them with my fists, I would just take off and dive at them head first and that's how I acquired the name "Crash"."

His first starring role using the name professionally was in the serial ''The Undersea Kingdom'', in which his screen character was also named "Crash Corrigan." The serial was created to capitalize on the popularity of the ''Flash Gordon'' serials and the nickname may have been appropriated by the Republic publicity department to create a similarly named hero.<ref>Anderson, Chuck.

==Death==
After his August 10, 1976 death at age 74 from a heart attack in Brookings Harbor, Oregon, Ray "Crash" Corrigan was interred at [[Inglewood Park Cemetery]], [[Inglewood, California]]. Nearly four decades later, his grave still remains unmarked.
