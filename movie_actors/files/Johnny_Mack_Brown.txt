'''Johnny "Mack" Brown''' (September 1, 1904 – November 14, 1974) was an American [[college football]] player and film actor<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', November 20, 1974.</ref> originally billed as '''John Mack Brown''' at the height of his screen career.

Born and raised in [[Dothan, Alabama]], Brown was a star of the high school football team, earning a football scholarship to the [[University of Alabama]]. His little brother Tolbert "Red" Brown played soon after Mack.
===University of Alabama===
While at the University of Alabama, Brown became an initiated member of the [[Kappa Sigma]] Fraternity.
====Football====
Brown was a prominent [[halfback (American football)|halfback]] on his university's [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Crimson Tide]] football team, coached by [[Wallace Wade]]. He earned the nickname "The Dothan Antelope."

Brown helped his team to become the 1925 [[NCAA Division I-A national football champions]]. In that year's [[1926 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl Game]], he earned [[Most Valuable Player]] honors after scoring two of his team's three touchdowns in an upset win over the heavily favored [[Washington Huskies]]. The 1926 Crimson Tide was thus the first southern team to ever win a Rose Bowl. The game is commonly referred to as "the game that changed the south."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cptr.ua.edu/news/roses.htm| title=The Football Game That Changed the South| publisher=The University of Alabama| accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref> Brown was selected [[College Football All-Southern Team|All-Southern]].<ref>{{cite news|title=All Southern Grid Team Compiled By The Associated Press|date=November 30, 1925|newspaper=Kingsport Times}}</ref>

==Film career==

His good looks and powerful physique saw him portrayed on [[List of athletes on Wheaties boxes|Wheaties cereal boxes]] and in 1927, brought an offer for motion picture screen tests that resulted in a long and successful career in [[Hollywood]]. He played silent film star [[Mary Pickford]]'s love interest in her first [[talkie]], ''[[Coquette (film)|Coquette]]'' (1929), for which Pickford won an Oscar.

He appeared in minor roles until 1930 when he was cast as the star in a [[Western (genre)|Western]] entitled ''[[Billy the Kid (1930 film)|Billy the Kid]]'' and directed by [[King Vidor]]. An early widescreen film (along with [[Raoul Walsh]]'s ''[[The Big Trail]]'' with [[John Wayne]], produced the same year), the movie also features [[Wallace Beery]] as [[Pat Garrett]].  Brown was billed over Beery, who would become [[MGM]]'s highest paid actor within the next three years.  Also in 1930, Brown played [[Joan Crawford]]'s love interest in ''[[Montana Moon]]''.  Brown went on to make several more top-flight movies under the name John Mack Brown, including ''[[The Secret Six]]'' (1931) with [[Wallace Beery]], [[Jean Harlow]], and [[Clark Gable]], as well as the legendary [[Lost Generation]] celebration of alcohol, ''[[The Last Flight (1931 film)|The Last Flight]]'' (1931), and was being groomed by [[MGM]] as a leading man until being abruptly replaced on ''[[Laughing Sinners]]'' in 1931, with all his scenes reshot, substituting rising star Clark Gable in his place.

Rechristened "Johnny Mack Brown" in the wake of this extremely serious career downturn, he made exclusively low budget westerns and eventually became one of the screen's top B-movie cowboy stars, making 127 western films during his career, including ''[[Ride 'Em Cowboy]]'' with [[Abbott and Costello]]. A fan of Mexican music, he showcased the talents of guitarist Francisco Mayorga and The Guadalajara Trio in films like ''[[Boss of Bullion City]]'' and ''[[The Masked Rider]]''.  Brown also starred in four [[Serial (film)|serials]] for [[Universal Studios]] (''[[Rustlers of Red Dog]]'', ''[[Wild West Days]]'', ''[[Flaming Frontiers]]'' and ''[[The Oregon Trail (1939 serial)|The Oregon Trail]]'') and was a hero to millions of young children at movie theaters and on their television screens.

When the B-Western genre dropped sharply in [[box office]] popularity, Johnny Mack Brown went into retirement in 1953. He returned more than ten years later to appear in secondary roles in a few Western films.  Altogether, Brown appeared in over 160 movies between 1927 and 1966, as well as a smattering of television shows, in a career spanning almost forty years.

==Personal life==
Brown was married to Cornelia "Connie" Foster from 1926 to his death in 1974, and they had four children.

==Awards==
In recognition of his contribution to the motion picture industry, Brown was given a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6101 Hollywood Blvd.  In 1969, Brown was inducted into the [[Alabama Sports Hall of Fame]].

==Death==
Brown died in [[Woodland Hills, California]] of [[congestive heart failure|heart failure]] at the age of 70. His cremated remains are interred in an outdoor Columbarium, in Glendale's [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]].
