'''Alex Nicol''' (January 20, 1916 - July 29, 2001) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and [[film director|director]].  Nicol appeared in many [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] including ''[[The Man from Laramie]]'' (1955). He appeared in over forty feature films as well as directing many [[television]] shows including ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (1967), ''[[Tarzan (1966 TV series)|Tarzan]]'' (1966), and ''[[Daniel Boone (TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' (1966). He also played many roles on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

==Biography==
He was born Alexander Livingston Nicol Jr., in [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining, New York]], in 1916. When his movie career started thirty-four years later he adjusted the year to 1919. "I was a little older than some of the other people under contract so I thought, 'Well, I'll cure that right now'," he later confessed. His father was the arms keeper at [[Sing Sing]]. He studied at the [[Feagin School of Dramatic Art]] before joining [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans']] theatrical company, with whom he made his Broadway debut with a walk-on in ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' (1939).<ref name="WWDixon">{{cite web | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JWywnr1dNucC&lpg=PT11&ots=Us8056ZukL&dq=%22Feagin%20school%22&pg=PT11#v=onepage&q=%22Feagin%20school%22&f=false | title=Surviving the Studio System: Alex Nicol | publisher=SIU Press | work=Collected Interviews: Voices from Twentieth-century Cinema | date=2001 | accessdate=14 August 2013 | author=Dixon, Wheeler Winston | pages=36}}</ref> Later a member of [[Actors Studio|The Actors Studio]],<ref>{{cite book|quote=|first=David |last=Garfield|title=A Player's Place: The Story of The Actors Studio|year=1980|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-02-542650-8|page=279|chapter=Appendix: Life Members of The Actors Studio as of January 1980}}</ref> Nicol would play Brick in [[Tennessee Williams|Tennessee Williams's]] ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', under the direction of Studio co-founder [[Elia Kazan]]. 

However, it was as a [[character actor]] that Nicol spent most of his career. He also [[Film director|directed]] [[film]]s, and appeared frequently on television.  His acting career was interrupted by a five-year stint in the [[United States Army|army]]. He served with the [[101st Cavalry Regiment|101st Cavalry]] and attained the rank of [[Technical Sergeant]].

Upon [[Military discharge|discharge]], Nicol returned to Broadway in a revival of [[Clifford Odets]]' pro-union drama ''[[Waiting for Lefty]]'' (1946).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Shortly thereafter, he was admitted to The Actors Studio, where he worked with [[Elia Kazan]]; this led to a role in the Studio's 1948 production of ''[[Sundown Beach]]'', staged by Kazan. Nicol next appeared in ''[[Forward the Heart]]'', and then as part of the original cast of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein|Rodgers and Hammerstein's]] musical ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949), playing one of the [[United States Marines|marines]], but after a few weeks in the show he successfully auditioned to replace [[Ralph Meeker]] as Mannion in ''[[Mister Roberts (play)|Mister Roberts]]'', and was also made [[understudy]] to the play's star [[Henry Fonda]].

<blockquote>''"But I never made it! He never missed a performance! Henry's wife at the time killed herself during the run of the show and he still didn't miss the performance. We were one minute from curtain time when Fonda walked in, in costume, and he just walked right out, hit his mark and played the performance as though nothing had happened."''</blockquote> 

While acting in ''Mister Roberts'', Nicol was seen by the [[Universal Studios]] director [[George Sherman]], who was in [[New York City]] to film ''[[The Sleeping City]]'' (1950). He cast Nicol as a young doctor. Nicol was given a contract by Universal, and Sherman also directed his second film, ''[[Tomahawk (film)|Tomahawk]]'' (1951), in which he played a [[cavalry]] officer with a hatred of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]].

Small roles as a [[prisoner of war]] in ''[[Target Unknown]]'' (1951) and a trainee [[Aviator|pilot]] in ''[[Air Cadet (1951 film)|Air Cadet]]'' (1951) preceded Nicol's first major part, co-starring with [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Shelley Winters]] in the musical drama ''[[Meet Danny Wilson (film)|Meet Danny Wilson]]'' (1952). In his next film he was an [[antagonist]] again, causing [[Loretta Young]] to be wrongly sent to [[prison]] in ''[[Because of You (film)|Because of You]]'' (1952). He played a troublesome sergeant in ''[[Red Ball Express (film)|Red Ball Express]]'' (1952), directed by [[Budd Boetticher]]. 

Nicol's first lead role was opposite [[Maureen O'Hara]] in ''[[The Redhead from Wyoming]]'' (1953) directed by [[Lee Sholem]].

<blockquote>''"Roll 'Em Sholem" they used to call him. All he would say before every scene was "Roll 'Em!" And then when you got to the end of the scene he'd say "Cut!" and then he'd look at the script clerk and say, "Did they say all the words?", and if so that was it. When the picture was over I went to the front office at Universal and asked to be released from my contract. They thought I was crazy. But I thought, "If this is my big break, then I'm not going very far."''</blockquote>

Going [[freelance]], Nicol was directed by [[Daniel Mann]] in ''[[About Mrs Leslie]]'' (1953) starring [[Shirley Booth]] and [[Robert Ryan]]. Nicol returned to Universal (at a much larger salary than he had been getting as a contract player) to appear in two George Sherman films, ''[[The Lone Hand (1953 film)|The Lone Hand]]'' (1953) and ''[[Dawn at Socorro]]'' (1954). Nicol then made three films in [[England]], most notably [[Ken Hughes]]' ''[[The House Across the Lake]]'' (1954).

<blockquote>''"It was a great script, and Sidney James, a wonderful actor, was in it, along with Hillary Brooke. Eventually I got back to the United States and I was glad to come back. Those British pictures kept me working, but they were really fast, really cheaply budgeted."''</blockquote>

[[Anthony Mann]] directed Nicol in his role as a navigator in ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'' (1955), and it was Mann who then gave the actor his best-remembered role as the weak [[psychopathic]] son of a [[patriarch]] [[rancher]] ([[Donald Crisp]]) that menaced [[James Stewart|Jimmy Stewart]] in ''The Man from Laramie'' (1955).

After a supporting role in [[Jacques Tourneur|Jacques Tourneur's]] ''[[Great Day in the Morning]]'' (1956) Nicol believed his [[Hollywood]] career was not progressing. In 1956 he returned to Broadway to replace [[Ben Gazzara]] in the lead role of Brick, in ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof''. When the Broadway run ended Nicol starred in the tour.

Nicol starred with Shelley Winters in the play ''[[Saturday Night Kid]]'' (1958). He then returned to Hollywood where he made his first film as a director, ''[[The Screaming Skull]]'' (1958), in which he also acted.

<blockquote>''"I wasn't doing the kind of films as an actor that I wanted to do, so I thought, "Well, I'll try directing." We shot the picture in six weeks and it did very well, so I was happy with that."''</blockquote>

Nicol traveled to [[Italy]] when director [[Martin Ritt]] gave him a role in ''[[Five Branded Women]]'' (1959). While there he was offered parts in other movies. He and his family remained in [[Europe]] for two years. 

<blockquote>''"We lived in Rome; God, it was beautiful. We did a lot of films very quickly, with backing from Italian and Yugoslavian finance sources. It was one of the happiest times of my life."''</blockquote>

Returning to the United States in 1961, he played [[Paul Anka|Paul Anka's]] father in the thriller ''[[Look in Any Window]]'' (1961), then produced and directed a war film in [[Rome]], ''[[Then There Were Three (film)|Then There Were Three]]'' (1961), in which he co-starred with [[Frank Latimore]]. Subsequent acting roles included the ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "Young Man's Fancy" in 1962; two westerns, ''[[The Savage Guns]]'' (1962) and ''[[Gunfighters of the Casa Grande]]'' (1964); and [[Roger Corman|Roger Corman's]] ''[[Bloody Mama]]'' (1969), based on the life of [[Ma Barker]].

Nicol later worked as a director in television and did episodes of ''Daniel Boone'', ''Wild Wild West'', and many episodes for ''Tarzan'' starring [[Ron Ely]]. The last film in which he acted was ''[[A*P*E]]'' (1976), an independent movie made by a friend of the actor. He retired in the late 1980s and died of natural causes in Montecito, California in 2001.

Alex Nicol was survived by his wife, Jean and his three children, Lisa Nicol, Alexander Nicol III, and Eric Nicol.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/alex-nicol-729341.html|title=Alex Nicol: Obituary|date=2001-08-20|publisher=''The Independent on Sunday''|accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{Amg name|104476}}</ref>
