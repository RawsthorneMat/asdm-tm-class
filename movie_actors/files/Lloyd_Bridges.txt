'''Lloyd Vernet Bridges, Jr.''' (January 15, 1913 – March 10, 1998) was an American actor who starred in a number of television series and appeared in more than 150 feature films. He was the father of actors [[Beau Bridges]] and [[Jeff Bridges]].

==Early life==
Bridges was born in [[San Leandro, California]], the son of Harriet Evelyn (née Brown; 1893–1950) and Lloyd Vernet Bridges, Sr. (1887–1962), who was involved in the California hotel business and once owned a movie theater.<ref name=.oco>{{Cite book|last=H.W. Wilson Company|title=Current biography yearbook, Volume 51|publisher=H. W. Wilson Co.|year=1990|pages=90}}</ref> His parents were both natives of [[Kansas]], and had [[English American|English]] ancestry. Bridges graduated from [[Petaluma High School]] in 1931.  He studied political science at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], where he was a member of [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity.

==Career==
Bridges made his Broadway debut in 1939 in a production of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]''. In 1941, he joined the stock company at [[Columbia Pictures]], where he played small roles in features and short subjects. (In ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'' Bridges is the pilot of the plane in the "heaven" scene.)

He left Columbia Pictures to enlist in the [[U.S. Coast Guard]]. Following World War II, he returned to film acting.  He was later a member of U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, 11th District (California) and did a number of public service announcements for the Coast Guard.  He was later appointed an honorary commodore.  His sons, actors Beau and Jeff, served in the Coast Guard and Coast Guard Reserve.<ref>U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office http://www.uscg.mil/history/faqs/lloydbridges.asp Retrieved 5 February 2014</ref>

He was [[blacklist]]ed briefly in the 1950s after he admitted to the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] that he had once been a member of the [[Actors' Laboratory Theatre]], a group with links to the [[Communist party]]. He resumed working after being cleared by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], finding his greatest success in television.

Bridges garnered press in 1956 for his emotional performance on live anthology program ''[[The Alcoa Hour]]'', in an episode titled "Tragedy in a Temporary Town", directed by [[Sidney Lumet]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Actor's Slip Of Tongue Keeps TV Viewers Arguing | work = The Hartford Courant | date = March 9, 1956 | page = 9 | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/893284932.html?dids=893284932:893284932&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Mar+09%2C+1956&author=&pub=Hartford+Courant&desc=Actor%27s+Slip+Of+Tongue+Keeps+TV+Viewers+Arguing&pqatl=google | accessdate =May 7, 2011}}</ref> During the performance, Bridges inadvertently used profanity while [[Ad libitum|ad-libbing]].<ref name=LP>{{cite news | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FCdUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ODoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=7194,3300013&dq=alcoa+hour+bridges&hl=en | title = Profanity Ad-libbed by Emotional Actor | agency = Associated Press | work = The Leader-Post | date = February 20, 1956 | accessdate =May 7, 2011}}</ref> Although the slip of the tongue generated hundreds of complaints, the episode won a [[Robert E.

[[File:Lloyd Bridges, 1989.jpg|thumb|Bridges at the [[61st Academy Awards]] in 1989]]
Bridges gained wide recognition as Mike Nelson, the main character in the television series ''[[Sea Hunt]]'', created by [[Ivan Tors]], which ran in [[Television syndication|syndication]] from 1958–1961. He also wrote a book with a co-author about skin-diving entitled "Mask and Flippers." Following that success, he starred in the eponymous [[CBS]] [[anthology series]] ''[[The Lloyd Bridges Show]]'' (1962–1963, produced by [[Aaron Spelling]]), which included appearances by his sons [[Beau Bridges|Beau]] and [[Jeff Bridges|Jeff]]. Producer [[Gene Roddenberry]], who worked with Bridges on "Sea Hunt", reportedly offered Bridges the role of [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' before the part went to [[William Shatner]]. In addition, he was a regular cast member in the [[Rod Serling]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series ''[[The Loner]]'' (which lasted one season from 1965 to 1966; Bridges pulled out in disagreement over the violent content of the show), and in the two [[NBC]] failures ''[[San Francisco International Airport (TV series)|San Francisco International Airport]]'' (1970/71) and a [[Police Story (TV series)|Police Story]] spin-off ''[[Joe Forrester]]'' (1975–76). Later, he appeared in ''[[Paper Dolls]]'' (1984) and ''[[Capital News]]'' (1990), both for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and again with ''[[Harts of the West]]'' (1993–1994), this time for CBS, a comedy/western set on a [[dude ranch]] in [[Nevada]]. Son Beau Bridges co-starred, along with [[Harley Jane Kozak]] as Beau's wife, Alison Hart, and [[Sean Murray (actor)|Sean Murray]] as the oldest Hart son, Zane Grey Hart.

Bridges played significant roles in several mini-series, including ''[[Roots (TV miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[How the West Was Won (TV series)|How the West Was Won]]'' and ''[[The Blue and the Gray (miniseries)|The Blue and the Gray]]''.

For more than forty-five years, Bridges was a frequent guest star on television series. He received a second Emmy Award nomination four decades after the first when he was nominated in 1998 for his role as [[List of Seinfeld minor characters#izzy|Izzy Mandelbaum]] on ''[[Seinfeld]]''.

He portrayed [[Commander Cain]] in the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' television series, in the two-part episode ''[[The Living Legend]]''.  His fate was left unanswered, spurring fans to call for his return.  This popularity led to a radically re-imagined Cain character in the 2004 series.

He started as a contract performer for [[Columbia Pictures]], appearing in classics such as ''[[A Walk in the Sun (1945 film)|A Walk In The Sun]]'', ''[[High Noon]]'', ''[[Little Big Horn (film)|Little Big Horn]]'', and ''[[Sahara (1943 American film)|Sahara]]''. By the end of his career, he had re-invented himself and demonstrated a gifted comedic talent in such [[parody film]]s as ''[[Airplane!]]'', ''[[Hot Shots!]]'', and ''[[Jane Austen's Mafia!]]''. He acted in the role of "The President" in the movie ''[[Hot Shots! Part Deux]]''.

==Personal life==
[[File:Beau and lloyd Bridges 1992.jpg|left|thumb|Bridges and his son [[Beau Bridges|Beau]] at the 44th Emmy Awards, August 30, 1992]]
Bridges met his wife, [[Dorothy Bridges]] (née Simpson) in his fraternity; they married in 1938 in New York City.<ref name=lat>{{cite news |first=Dennis|last=McLellan|title=Dorothy Bridges dies at 93; 'the hub' of an acting family |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dorothy-bridges21-2009feb21,0,1331555.story|work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 21, 2009 |accessdate=April 23, 2009}}</ref> They had four children: the actors [[Beau Bridges]] (born in 1941) and [[Jeff Bridges]] (born in 1949); a daughter, Lucinda Louise Bridges (born in October 1953);<ref>[http://www.superiorpics.com/beau_bridges/ Superior Pics: Beau Bridges Profile] Retrieved 2012-05-28</ref> and another son, Garrett Myles Bridges, who died of [[Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]] on August 3, 1948. The actor [[Jordan Bridges]] is Beau's son and Lloyd's grandson. Dorothy and Lloyd exchanged vows again for their 50th wedding anniversary.

A [[World government|world federalist]], Bridges once said, "The devastation caused by war and the pollution of our environment knows no boundaries. Only an effective world government could provide sufficient law and have the power to control these destructive forces."<ref>{{Wayback |date=20040615173642 |url=http://www.worldpeacenews.org/AUTH/ARCHIVE/077..htm |title=World Peace News}}</ref> He was also involved in several organizations, including the [[Oceana (non-profit group)|American Oceans Campaign]] and [[Heal the Bay]], a Los Angeles-based group.

==Death==
On March 10, 1998, Bridges died of natural causes at the age of 85. He was married to [[Dorothy Bridges]] (née Simpson; 1915–2009), from 1938 until his death.

===Tributes===
An episode ("[[The Burning (Seinfeld episode)|The Burning]]") in the final ''Seinfeld'' season (1998) was dedicated to the memory of Lloyd Bridges. He had played the character of Izzy Mandelbaum in the episodes "[[The English Patient (Seinfeld)|The English Patient]]" in 1997 and "[[The Blood (Seinfeld)|The Blood]]" later the same year.

Bridges's last film, ''[[Jane Austen's Mafia!]]'', was dedicated to him.

In 2011 Bridges was posthumously named as one of six recipients – two of whom are his sons Beau and Jeff – of the Lone Sailor Award, which honors former Coast Guard servicemen who have gone on to forge successful careers as civilians.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lone Sailor Award recipient: Beau Bridges|url=http://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2011/09/lone-sailor-award-recipient-beau-bridges/|publisher=Coast Guard Compass|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Navy Memorial Hosts 24th Annual Lone Sailor Awards Dinner|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=62906|publisher=[[United States Navy|navy.mil]]|date=September 23, 2011}}</ref>
