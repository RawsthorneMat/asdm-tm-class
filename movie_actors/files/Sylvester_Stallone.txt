'''Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone''' ({{IPAc-en|s|t|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n}}; born July 6, 1946), nicknamed '''Sly Stallone''',<ref>{{cite web|author=Felicity Thistlethwaite |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2507748/Sylvester-Stallone-reveals-orange-face-New-York.html |title=Sylvester Stallone reveals orange face in New York &#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=November 15, 2013 |accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref> is an American actor, screenwriter and film director.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1232958/Dont-day-job--Sylvester-Stallone-tries-hand-fine-art-mixed-results.html|title=Don't give up the day job... Sylvester Stallone tries his hand at fine art with mixed results|work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=December 3, 2009}}</ref> Stallone is well known for his Hollywood action roles. Two notable characters he has portrayed are the boxer [[Rocky Balboa]], the [[title character]] of the [[Rocky (film series)|''Rocky'' series]] from 1976 to 2015 and soldier [[John Rambo]] from the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' saga, which ran from 1982 to 2008. He wrote every episode of the two eponymous franchises, and directed some of their installments as well.

Stallone's film ''[[Rocky]]'' was inducted into the [[National Film Registry]] as well as having its film props placed in the [[Smithsonian Museum]]. Stallone's use of the front entrance to the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in the ''Rocky'' series led the area to be nicknamed the [[Rocky Steps]]. Philadelphia has a statue of his Rocky character placed permanently near the museum. It was announced on December 7, 2010 that Stallone was voted into boxing's [[International Boxing Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/pet-rock-1.811972/sylvester-stallone-hall-of-famer-1.2523881|title=Sylvester Stallone, hall of famer|date=December 7, 2010|work=Newsday|accessdate=December 7, 2010}}</ref>

He has been nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] for ''Rocky'', [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. He became the third man in history to receive these two nominations for the same film, after [[Charles Chaplin]] and [[Orson Welles]] and followed by [[Warren Beatty]], [[Matt Damon]] and [[Roberto Benigni]].

==Hollywood career==

===''The Party at Kitty and Stud's'' and ''Score''===
Stallone had his first starring role in the [[soft core pornography]] feature film ''[[The Party at Kitty and Stud's]]'' (1970). He was paid $200 for two days' work.<ref name="TotalFilm-Stallone">
{{cite journal

 }} Stallone: "I was broke and basically sleeping in the Port Authority bus station for three weeks straight. I read in a trade paper about this film [''The Party at Kitty and Studs'', 1970] that was paying $100 a dayfor a $100 a day I would wreak havoc. Instead of doing something desperate, I worked for two days for $200 and got myself out of the bus station."</ref> Stallone later explained that he had done the film out of desperation after being evicted from his apartment and finding himself homeless for several days. He has also said that he slept three weeks in the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] in [[New York City]] prior to seeing a casting notice for the film. In the actor's words, "it was either do that movie or rob someone, because I was at the end – the very end – of my rope".<ref>[http://www.playboy.com/arts-entertainment/features/sylvester-stallone/sylvester-stallone-04.html Sylvester Stallone interview], ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'', September 1978.{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> The film was released several years later as ''Italian Stallion'', in order to cash in on Stallone's newfound fame (the new title was taken from Stallone's nickname since ''Rocky'' and a line from the film).
[[File:Sylvester Stallone - 1977.jpg|thumb|At the [[Ken Norton#Aftermath: Norton becomes champion|Ken Norton - Duane Bobick boxing match]] in 1977.]]

Stallone also starred in the erotic off-Broadway stage play ''Score'' which ran for 23 performances at the Martinique Theatre from October 28 – November 15, 1971 and was later made into [[Score (film)|a film by Radley Metzger]].

===1970–1975: Early film roles===
In 1970, Stallone appeared in the film ''[[No Place to Hide (1970 film)|No Place to Hide]],'' which was re-cut and retitled ''Rebel,'' the second version featuring Stallone as its star. After the style of [[Woody Allen|Woody Allen's]] ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]],'' this film, in 1990, was re-edited from [[outtake]]s from the original movie and newly shot matching footage, then [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|redubbed]] into an award-winning parody of itself titled ''A Man Called... Rainbo''.<ref>{{IMDb title|100101|A Man Called...Rainbo}}</ref> Again starring Stallone, this self-parody was directed by [[David Casci]] and produced by [[Jeffrey Hilton]]. ''A Man Called...Rainbo'' won Silver Awards at the [[Chicago International Film Festival]] and [[WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival|Worldfest – Houston]]. It was featured on ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' along with its credited star, Sylvester Stallone. It received a Thumbs-Up on ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|Siskel & Ebert]]'' and was recommended by [[Michael Medved]] on the movie review show, ''[[Sneak Previews]]''.

Stallone's other first few film roles were minor, and included brief uncredited appearances in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971) as a subway thug, in the psychological thriller ''[[Klute]]'' (1971) as an extra dancing in a club, and in the [[Jack Lemmon]] film ''[[The Prisoner of Second Avenue]]'' (1975) as a youth. In the Lemmon film, Jack Lemmon's character chases, tackles and mugs Stallone, thinking that Stallone's character is a pickpocket. He had his second starring role in ''[[The Lords of Flatbush]],'' in 1974.<ref name=tca/> In 1975, he played supporting roles in ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]''; ''[[Capone (film)|Capone]]''; and ''[[Death Race 2000]]''. He made guest appearances on the TV series ''[[Police Story (TV series)|Police Story]]'' and ''[[Kojak]]''.

===Success with ''Rocky''===

[[Image:Sylvester Stallone (1983).jpg|thumb|190px|Sylvester Stallone in 1983]]
Stallone gained worldwide fame with his starring role in the smash hit ''[[Rocky]]'' (1976).<ref name=tca/> On March 24, 1975, Stallone saw the [[Muhammad Ali]]–[[Chuck Wepner]] fight. That night Stallone went home, and after three days,<ref>{{YouTube|S5bslRI4gFk|The Rocky Story by Sly Stallone}}</ref> 20 straight hours<ref name=tony-story>{{YouTube|_TC6jSRSElk|As told to Tony Robbins}}</ref> he had written the script, but Stallone subsequently denied that Wepner provided any inspiration for it.<ref name="ESPN Wepner Recognized">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/page/IamChuckWepner/chuck-wepner-recognized-rocky-fame |title=Chuck Wepner finally recognized for 'Rocky' fame - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2011-10-25 |accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref><ref name="The Real Rocky">{{cite video | people=Feuerzeig, Jeff (Director) | date=2011-10-25 | title=The Real Rocky | medium=Motion picture | publisher=ESPN Films}}</ref> Other possible inspirations for the film may have included [[Rocky Graziano]]'s autobiography ''Somebody Up There Likes Me,'' and [[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|the movie of the same name]]. Wepner filed a lawsuit which was eventually settled with Stallone for an undisclosed amount.<ref name="The Real Rocky" /> Stallone then attempted to sell the script to multiple studios, with the intention of playing the lead role himself. Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff became interested and offered Stallone $350,000 for the rights, but had their own ideas for the lead role, including [[Robert Redford]] and [[Burt Reynolds]]. Stallone refused to sell unless he played the lead character and eventually, after a substantial budget cut to compromise, it was agreed he could be the star.<ref>{{cite book| last = Nelson| first= Murray R.| title = American Sports: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas [4 Volumes]: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas | date= May 23, 2013 | page= 1095 | accessdate= April 1, 2014}}</ref>

''Rocky'' was nominated for ten [[Academy Award]]s, including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] nominations for Stallone. The film went on to win the Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Directing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148/awards |title=''Rocky'' Award Wins and Nominations |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref>

===More ''Rocky'', ''Rambo'', and additional roles===
Following the success of ''Rocky'', Stallone made his directorial debut and starred in the 1978 film ''[[Paradise Alley]]'', a family drama in which he played one of three brothers who enter the world of [[wrestling]]. That same year he starred in [[Norman Jewison]]'s ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'', a social drama in which he plays a warehouse worker, very loosely modeled on [[James Hoffa]], who becomes involved in the labor union leadership. In 1979 he wrote, directed and starred in the sequel to his 1976 hit: ''[[Rocky II]]'' (replacing [[John G. Avildsen]], who won an Academy Award for directing the first film), which also became a major success,<ref name=tca/> grossing $200&nbsp;million.[[File:Sylvester Stallone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Stallone in 1988]] In 1981 he starred alongside [[Michael Caine]] in ''[[Escape to Victory]]'', a sports drama in which he plays a [[prisoner of war]] involved in a Nazi propaganda soccer game. That same year he starred in the thriller ''[[Nighthawks (film)|Nighthawks]]'', in which he plays a New York city cop who plays a cat and mouse game with a foreign terrorist, played by [[Rutger Hauer]].

Stallone launched another major franchise success, starring as [[Vietnam-American War|Vietnam]] veteran [[John Rambo]], a former Green Beret, in the action-war film ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982).<ref name=tca/> The first installment of ''Rambo'' was both a critical and box office success. Critics praised Stallone's performance, saying he made Rambo seem human, as opposed to the way he is portrayed in the book of the same name. Two Rambo sequels, ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985) and ''[[Rambo III]]'' (1988), followed. Although box office hits, they met with much less critical praise than the original.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} He also continued his box office success with the ''Rocky'' franchise and wrote, directed, and starred in two more sequels to the series: ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982) and ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985). Stallone has portrayed these two characters in a total of ten films. In preparation for these roles, Stallone embarked upon a vigorous training regimen which often meant six days a week in the gym and further sit ups in the evenings. Stallone claims to have gotten his [[body fat percentage]] down to his all time low of 2.8% for ''Rocky III''.<ref>Berg, Michael. ''Muscle & Fitness'', Sept. 2004.</ref> Stallone met former [[Mr. Olympia]] [[Franco Columbu]] to develop the appearance for ''Rocky II'' and ''Rambo II'' films, just as if he were preparing for the Mr. Olympia competition. That meant two workouts a day, six days a week.<ref>[http://sylvesterstallone.com/health-fitness/four/ Sylvester Stallone – Four<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

During this time period, Stallone cultivated a strong overseas following. He also attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, roles in different genres. In 1984 he co-wrote and starred alongside [[Dolly Parton]] in the comedy film ''[[Rhinestone (film)|Rhinestone]]'' where he played a wannabe country music singer. For the [[Rhinestone (film soundtrack)|''Rhinestone'' soundtrack]], he performed a song. In 1987 he starred in the family drama ''[[Over the Top (film)|Over the Top]]'' as a struggling trucker who tries to make amends with his estranged son. These films did not do well at the box office and were poorly received by critics. It was around 1985 that Stallone was signed to a remake of the 1939 [[James Cagney]] classic ''[[Angels With Dirty Faces]]''. The film would form part of his multi-picture deal with Cannon Pictures and was to co-star [[Christopher Reeve]] and be directed by [[Menahem Golan]]. The re-making of such a beloved classic was met with disapproval by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and horror by top critic Roger Ebert. Cannon opted to make ''[[Cobra (1986 film)|Cobra]]'' instead. ''Cobra'' (1986) and the [[buddy cop]] action film ''[[Tango and Cash]]'' (1989) alongside [[Kurt Russell]] did solid business domestically but overseas they did blockbuster business, grossing over $100&nbsp;million in foreign markets and over $160&nbsp;million worldwide.

[[File:Sylvester Stallone Cannes.jpg|thumb|Stallone at the [[1993 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
The 1990s began with Stallone starring in the fifth installment of the ''Rocky'' franchise, ''[[Rocky V]]''. This film brought back the original film's director John G. Avildsen. It was considered a box office disappointment<ref>{{cite news|title='Home' KOs 'Rocky V' at Box Office : Movies: The comedy grabs $17 million in receipts to take the No. 1 spot over Stallone's much-hyped sequel.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-20/entertainment/ca-5106_1_weekend-box|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 20, 1990}}</ref> and was also negatively received by both critics and audiences. At the time, this was intended to be the last film in the franchise.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. He attempted the comedy genre starring in two comedies, the critical and commercial disasters ''[[Oscar (1991 film)|Oscar]]'' (1991) and ''[[Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot]]'' (1992) during the early 1990s. In 1993 he made a comeback with the hit ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', which was a success in the US, grossing $84&nbsp;million, but even more successful worldwide, grossing $171&nbsp;million. Later that year, he starred with [[Wesley Snipes]] in the [[futuristic]] action film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', which grossed over $158&nbsp;million worldwide. His string of hits continued with 1994's ''[[The Specialist]]'' (over $170&nbsp;million worldwide gross). In 1995, he played the futuristic character [[Judge Dredd]] (from the British comic book ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'') in the eponymous film ''[[Judge Dredd (1995 film)|Judge Dredd]]''. His overseas box office appeal saved the domestic box office disappointment of ''Judge Dredd'', which cost almost $100&nbsp;million and barely made its budget back, with a worldwide tally of $113&nbsp;million. He also appeared in the thriller ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'' (1995) with [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Antonio Banderas]]. In 1996, he starred in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Daylight (film)|Daylight]]'', which was not very successful in the US, but grossed $126&nbsp;million overseas.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

That same year, Stallone, along with an all-star cast of celebrities, appeared in the [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] short comedy film "[[Your Studio and You]]" commissioned by the [[Seagram|Seagram Company]] for a party celebrating their acquisition of [[Universal Studios]] and the MCA Corporation. Stallone speaks in his Rocky Balboa voice with subtitles translating what he is saying. At one point, Stallone starts yelling about how can they use his Balboa character, that he left it in the past; the narrator calms him with a [[wine cooler]] and calling him "brainiac." In response, Stallone says, "Thank you very much." He then looks at the wine cooler and exclaims, "Stupid cheap studio!"<ref>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6493841613076981287 Your Studio and you]{{dead link|date=December 2013}} (From Google Video)</ref>

Following his breakthrough performance in ''Rocky'', critic Roger Ebert had stated that Stallone could become the next [[Marlon Brando]], though he never recaptured the critical acclaim achieved with ''Rocky''. Stallone did go on to receive much acclaim for his role in the low-budget crime drama ''[[Cop Land]]'' (1997), in which he starred alongside [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Ray Liotta]], but the film was only a minor success at the box office.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} His performance led him to win the [[Stockholm International Film Festival]] Best Actor Award. In 1998 he did voice-over work for the computer-animated film ''[[Antz]],'' which was a big hit domestically.

In 2000, Stallone starred in the thriller ''[[Get Carter (2000 film)|Get Carter]]'' – a remake of the 1971 British [[Michael Caine]] film of the [[Get Carter|same name]]—but the film was poorly received by both critics and audiences. Stallone's career declined considerably after his subsequent films ''[[Driven]]'' (2001), ''[[Avenging Angelo]]'' (2002) and ''[[D-Tox]]'' (2002) also underachieved expectations to do well at the box office and were poorly received by critics.

===2003–2005===
In 2003, he played a villainous role in the third installment of the [[Spy Kids]] trilogy ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'' which was a huge box office success (almost $200&nbsp;million worldwide). Stallone also had a cameo appearance in the 2003 French film ''[[Taxi 3]]'' as a passenger.

Following several poorly reviewed box office flops, Stallone started to regain prominence for his supporting role in the [[neo-noir]] crime drama ''[[Shade (film)|Shade]]'' (2003) which was only released in a limited fashion but was praised by critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shade/ |title=Shade at Rottentomatoes |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> He was also attached to star and direct a film tentatively titled ''Rampart Scandal,'' which was to be about the murder of rappers [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and the surrounding [[Los Angeles Police Department]] corruption scandal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1472396/20030606/story.jhtml|title=Sylvester Stallone Making Movie About Biggie, Tupac Murders|last=Patel|first=Joseph|date=June 6, 2003|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}</ref> It was later titled ''Notorious'' but was shelved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur30196.cfm|title=Stallone's Tupac/Biggie Movie a No Go: Actor was to play LAPD detective who found dirty cops at root of murders|date=December 7, 2006|work=EURWeb.com|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref>

In 2005, he was the co-presenter, alongside [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], of the [[NBC]] Reality television boxing series ''[[The Contender (TV series)|The Contender]]''. That same year he also made a guest appearance in two episodes of the television series ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]''. In 2005, Stallone also inducted wrestling icon [[Hulk Hogan]], who appeared in ''Rocky III'' as a wrestler named Thunderlips, into the WWE Hall of Fame; Stallone was also the person who offered Hogan the cameo in ''Rocky III''.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.donaly.com/celebrity_scene_weekly.html |title=Sylvester Stallone Rocky- Celebrity Scene Monthly By Don Aly Vol 36 |publisher= Donaly.com |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref>

===2006–2008: Revisiting ''Rocky'' and ''Rambo''===
[[File:Stallone-Hollywood-Star.jpg|thumb|Sylvester Stallone Hollywood Star on [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]]]
After a three-year hiatus from films, Stallone made a comeback in 2006 with the sixth installment of his successful Rocky series, ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'', which was a critical and commercial hit. After the critical and box office failure of the previous installment ''[[Rocky V]]'', Stallone had decided to write, direct and star in a sixth installment which would be a more appropriate climax to the series. The total domestic box office came to $70.3&nbsp;million (and $155.7&nbsp;million worldwide).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=rocky6.htm |title=Rocky Balboa at Box Office Mojo |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> The budget of the movie was only $24&nbsp;million. His performance in ''Rocky Balboa'' has been praised and garnered mostly positive reviews.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rocky_balboa/Rocky Balboa at RottenTomatoes]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>

Stallone's fourth installment of his other successful movie franchise is titled simply ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]''. The film opened in 2,751 theaters on January 25, 2008, grossing $6,490,000 on its opening day and $18,200,000 over its opening weekend. Its box office was $113,244,290 worldwide with a budget of $50&nbsp;million.

Asked in February 2008 which of the icons he would rather be remembered for, Stallone said "it's a tough one, but ''Rocky'' is my first baby, so ''Rocky."''<ref>[http://www.stv.tv/content/out/film/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms:/out/films/video_interviews/sylvester_stallone_rambo_video_interview Sylvester Stallone: Rambo Returns, video interview with STV]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref>

===Other film work===
[[File:Flickr - nicogenin - 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra) - Sylvester Stallone (26).jpg|thumb|Stallone in 2009 at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]]]]
Stallone's debut as a director came in 1978 with ''[[Paradise Alley]],'' which he also wrote and starred in. In addition, he directed ''[[Staying Alive (1983 film)|Staying Alive]]'', the sequel to ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', along with ''Rocky II'', ''Rocky III'', ''Rocky IV'', ''Rocky Balboa'', and ''Rambo''. In August 2005, Stallone released his book ''Sly Moves'' which claimed to be a guide to fitness and nutrition as well as a candid insight into his life and works from his own perspective.

In the late 2006, the actor was interviewed by [[Pat Robertson]] from the [[Christian Broadcasting Network|CBN]]'s ''[[700 Club]]''. Stallone stated that before, in Hollywood, [[temptation]] abounded and he had "lost his way", but later put things "in God's hands".<ref>[http://www.cbn.com/tv/1365948765001 Sylvester Stallone On Faith, Integrity, And Rocky].

''[http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/stallone.asp#Phlb6mDRFBDLDEWF.99 Yo.]''. GQ Magazine. As quoted when asked "Are you a religious man?": ''I'm pretty spiritual; I believe a lot in the spirit of man. I'm certainly not an atheist.… I was baptized Catholic, but I don't belong to a structured church. I have no opposition to it. I think there's great nuggets of knowledge in there, some wonderful rules to live by.''</ref>

==Political views==
Stallone is an outspoken supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref>http://hollowverse.com/sylvester-stallone/</ref> In 2008, Stallone endorsed [[Arizona]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John McCain]] for [[United States presidential election, 2008|that year's presidential election]].<ref>http://www.newsmax.com/InsideCover/Sylvester-Stallone-Endors/2008/01/24/id/322736/</ref>
