'''Cameron Bruce Crowe''' (born July 13, 1957)<ref>{{cite web|title=According to the State of California. ''California Birth Index, 1905–1995''. Center for Health Statistics, California Department of Health Services, Sacramento, California |url=http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/39461|publisher=Familytreelegends.com|accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> is an American actor, author, director, producer, screenwriter and journalist. Before moving into the film industry, Crowe was a contributing editor at ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, for which he still frequently writes.

Crowe has made his mark with character-driven, personal films that have been generally hailed as refreshingly original and devoid of cynicism. Michael Walker in ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Crowe "something of a cinematic spokesman for the post-baby boom generation"<ref>''[[The New York Times]]''. September 6, 1992.</ref> because his first few films focused on that specific age group, first as high schoolers and then as young [[Adulthood|adults]] making their way in the world.

Crowe's debut screenwriting effort, ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', grew out of a book he wrote while posing for one year undercover as a student at [[Clairemont High School]] in San Diego, California. Later, he wrote and directed one more high school saga, ''[[Say Anything (film)|Say Anything]]'', and then ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'', a story of [[Seattle]] twentysomethings that was woven together by a soundtrack centering on that city's burgeoning [[grunge]] music scene. Crowe landed his biggest hit, though, with ''[[Jerry Maguire]]''. After this, he was given a green light to go ahead with a pet project, the autobiographical effort ''[[Almost Famous]]''. Centering on a teenage music journalist on tour with an up-and-coming band, it gave insight to his life as a 15-year-old writer for ''Rolling Stone''. Also in late 1999, Crowe released his second book, ''Conversations with [[Billy Wilder]]'', a question and answer session with the director.

==Early life==
Cameron Crowe was born in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], California. His father, James A. Crowe, originally from [[Kentucky]], owned a real estate and phone service business.<ref>https://apps.westpointaog.org/Memorials/Article/15070/</ref> His mother, Alice Marie (née George), "was a teacher, activist, and all-around live wire who did skits around the house and would wear a clown suit to school on special occasions."<ref name=Premiere66>''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]''. August 1992, p. 66.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/28/Cameron-Crowe.html |title=Cameron Crowe Biography (1957-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref><ref>http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/cameron_b_crowe_born_1957_6136106</ref> She worked as a psychology professor and family [[family therapy|therapist]] and often participated in peace demonstrations and causes relating to the rights of farm workers. Crowe was the youngest of three children with two sisters, but one died when he was young. The family moved around often but spent a lot of time in the desert town of [[Indio, California|Indio]]. Crowe commented that Indio was where "people owned tortoises, not dogs".<ref name=Premiere66 /> His family finally settled in [[San Diego]].

Crowe skipped [[kindergarten]] and two grades in elementary,<ref>K, Carolyn. [http://www.hoagiesgifted.org/grade_skipped.htm "Grades Skipped and Successful"]. ''Hoagies Gifted Education Page''. Retrieved July 22, 2006</ref> and by the time he attended Catholic high school, he was quite obviously younger than the other students. To add to his alienation, he was often ill because he suffered from [[nephritis]].<ref>Mai. [http://hoochiecoochiegal.wordpress.com/cameron-crowe-the-legacy-of-the-uncool/ "CAMERON CROWE: The Legacy of the UNCOOL"]. ''A Quick Fix of Sanity''. Retrieved July 22, 2006.</ref>

Crowe began writing for the school newspaper and by the age of 13 was contributing music reviews for an underground publication, ''[[The San Diego Door]]''. He began corresponding with [[Lester Bangs]], who had left the ''Door'' to become editor at the national rock magazine ''[[Creem]]'', and soon he was also submitting articles to ''Creem'' as well as ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]''. Crowe graduated from the [[University of San Diego High School]] in 1972 at the age of 15. On a trip to Los Angeles, he met [[Ben Fong-Torres]], the editor of ''Rolling Stone'', who hired him to write for the magazine. He also joined the ''Rolling Stone'' staff as a contributing editor and then became an associate editor. During this time Crowe interviewed [[Bob Dylan]], [[David Bowie]], [[Neil Young]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[the Eagles]], [[Poco]], [[Steely Dan]], members of [[Led Zeppelin]] and more.<ref>[http://www.theuncool.com/bio/ "Biography,"] The Uncool: The Official Website for Everything Cameron Crowe. Accessed Dec. 14, 2014.</ref> Crowe was ''Rolling Stone'''s youngest-ever contributor.

==Career==

===''Rolling Stone''===
Crowe's first cover story was on [[the Allman Brothers Band]].<ref>Crowe, Cameron. [http://www.cameroncrowe.com/eyes_ears/articles/crowe_jrl_allman_bros.html "Eyes and Ears"].[http://www.cameroncrowe.com/journalism/articles/crowe_jrl_allman_bros.html The Allman Brothers Story, Rolling Stone #149 – Compiled by Cameron Crowe and Faybeth Diamond – December 6, 1973] ''Cameron Crowe''. Retrieved July 22, 2006.</ref> He went on the road with them for three weeks at the age of 16 and interviewed not only the whole band, but also the entire [[road crew]].

Because Crowe was a fan of the 1970s [[hard rock]] bands that the older writers disliked, he landed a lot of major interviews. He wrote predominantly about [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and the band members, and also about [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[King Crimson]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Todd Rundgren]], and more. "He charmed a lot of people," Ben Fong-Torres told Rachel Abramowitz in ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]''. "He was the aw-shucks guy. 'I'm glad to be backstage. I love this band.{{' "}} In an interview with [[Joel Selvin]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Fong-Torres remarked, "He was the guy we sent out after some difficult customers. He covered the bands that disliked ''Rolling Stone''."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2000/09/10/PK109373.DTL&hw=cameron+crowe+ben+fong+torres&sn=002&sc=623 |title=How Writer-Director's Career Got Rolling |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=September 10, 2000 |accessdate=October 11, 2008 | first=Joel | last=Selvin}}'''</ref>

===''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' book and film===
When ''Rolling Stone'' moved its offices from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] to New York in 1977, Crowe decided to stay behind. He also felt the excitement of his career was beginning to wane. Crowe appeared in the 1978 film ''[[American Hot Wax]]'', but then returned to his writing. Though he would continue to freelance for ''Rolling Stone'' on and off over the years, he turned his attention to a book.

At the age of 22, Crowe came up with the idea to pose undercover as a high school student and write about his experiences. [[Simon & Schuster]] gave him a contract, and he moved back in with his parents and enrolled as Dave Cameron at [[Clairemont High School]] in San Diego. Reliving the senior year he never had, he made friends and began to fit in. Though he initially planned to include himself in the book, he realized that it would jeopardize his ability to truly capture the essence of the high school experience.

His book, ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High: A True Story'', came out in 1981. Crowe focused on six main characters: a tough guy, a [[nerd]], a surfer dude, a sexual sophisticate, and a middle-class brother and sister. He chronicled their activities in typical teenage settings—at school, at the beach, and at the mall, where many of them held afterschool jobs—and focused on details of their lives that probed into the heart of adolescence. This included scenes about [[homecoming]] and graduation as well as social [[clique]]s and sexual encounters.

Before the book was even released, ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' was [[optioned]] for a film. Released in 1982, the movie version lacked a specific [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] and featured no major name stars. The studio did not devote any marketing effort toward it. Nevertheless, it became a [[sleeper hit]] due to word of mouth.

The reviews of ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' were positive, and the film ended up launching the careers of some of the previously unknown actors, including [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Eric Stoltz]], [[Judge Reinhold]], [[Phoebe Cates]], [[Anthony Edwards]], and future [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winners [[Nicolas Cage]] (appearing under his given name, Nicolas Coppola), [[Forest Whitaker]], and [[Sean Penn]].

===Early film efforts===
Following this success, Crowe wrote the screenplay for 1984's ''[[The Wild Life (film)|The Wild Life]]'', the pseudo-sequel to ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High''. Whereas its predecessor followed teenagers' lives in high school, ''The Wild Life'' traced the lives of several teenagers after high school living in an apartment complex. Filmmaker [[James L. Brooks]] noticed Crowe's original voice and wanted to work with him. Brooks executive produced Crowe's first directing effort, 1989's ''Say Anything...'', about a young man pining away for the affections of the seemingly perfect girl. Though it could have easily ended up a formulaic teen love story, ''[[Say Anything (film)|Say Anything...]]'' got glowing reception from critics. They applauded the way Crowe crafted an intriguing and insightful tale that also involved the girl's relationship with her father and how it is threatened when she discovers he is caught up in a shady business deal.

By this point, Crowe was ready to leave teen [[angst]] behind and focus on his peers. His next project, 1992's ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'', centered on the romantic tangles among a group of six friends in their twenties in Seattle. The film starred [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[Matt Dillon]], where Fonda played a coffee-bar waitress fawning over an aspiring musician, played by Dillon. [[Kyra Sedgwick]] and [[Campbell Scott]] co-starred as a couple wavering on whether to commit to each other. Music forms an integral backbone for the script, and the soundtrack became a best seller three months before the release of the film. Much of this was due to repeated delays while studio executives debated how to market it.

''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'' successfully rode on the heels of Seattle's grunge music boom. During production, bands like [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] were not yet national stars, but by the time the soundtrack was released, their song "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" had to be cut because it was too costly to buy the rights. Also, before they got big, Crowe signed members of [[Pearl Jam]] to portray Dillon's fictional band Citizen Dick. Crowe also appeared in this project, appropriately, as a rock journalist at a club. Tim Appelo wrote in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', "With ... an ambling, naturalistic style, Crowe captures the eccentric appeal of a town where espresso carts sprout on every corner and kids in ratty flannel shirts can cut records that make them millionaires."<ref>Appelo, Tim. [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,311785,00.html "Seattle Night Fever"]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. September 18, 1992, p. 46.</ref>

==Breakthrough==

===''Jerry Maguire''===
Branching into a new direction, Crowe wrote and directed ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', about a high-powered [[sports agent]] who is fired after having a moment of clarity in which he writes and distributes a Mission Statement calling for more service to the athletes and less money for themselves. He strikes out to form his own agency. [[Tom Cruise]] played the title role of Jerry and [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]] played Rod Tidwell, the aging football player whose [[catchphrase]], "Show me the money!", became [[Meme|ubiquitous]] for a time. [[Renée Zellweger]] also appeared as the bookkeeper who leaves her job to follow Maguire into new territory in both work and love. Crowe's earlier efforts brought him recognition, but this would send him soaring onto the [[A-list]]. Gooding won a [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his role, and the film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Editing, and Best Actor (for Cruise). Cruise also won his second [[Golden Globe]] for his role as Jerry.

===''Almost Famous''===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2013}}
In 2000, Crowe tapped his rock-writer roots to write and direct ''[[Almost Famous]]'', about the experiences of a teenage music journalist who goes on the road with an emerging band in the early 1970s. The film starred newcomer [[Patrick Fugit]] as William Miller, the baby-faced writer who finds himself immersed in the world of sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll, and [[Kate Hudson]] co-starred as Penny Lane, a prominent groupie, or, as the film refers to her, a "Band-Aid". Digging into his most personal memories, Crowe used a composite of the bands he had known to come up with Stillwater, the emerging act that welcomes the young journalist into its sphere, then becomes wary of his intentions. Seventies rocker [[Peter Frampton]] served as a technical consultant on the film.

William Miller's mother figured prominently in the film as well (often admonishing, "Don't take drugs!"). The character was based on Crowe's own mother, who even showed up at the film sets to keep an eye on him while he worked. Though he asked her not to bother [[Frances McDormand]], who played her character, the two ended up getting along well. Also in the film he showed his sister, portrayed by [[Zooey Deschanel]], rebelling and leaving home, and in real life, his mother and sister Cindy did not talk for a decade and were still estranged to a degree when he finished the film. The family reconciled when the project was complete.

In addition, Crowe took a copy of the film to London for a special screening with Led Zeppelin members [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]]. After the screening, Led Zeppelin granted Crowe the right to use one of their songs on the soundtrack—the first time they had ever consented to this since allowing Crowe to use "Kashmir" in ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High''—and also gave him rights to four of their other songs in the movie itself, although they did not grant him the rights to "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" for an intended scene (on the special "Bootleg" edition DVD, the scene is included as an extra sans the song where the viewer is instructed by a watermark to begin playing it). Crowe and his then-wife, musician [[Nancy Wilson (guitarist)|Nancy Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], co-wrote three of the five [[Stillwater (fictional band)|Stillwater]] songs in the film, and Frampton wrote the other two, with Mike McCready from Pearl Jam playing lead guitar on all of the Stillwater songs. Reviews were almost universally positive, and it was nominated for and won a host of film awards, including an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Crowe. Crowe and co-producer Danny Bramson also won the [[Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media|Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]] [[Grammy Award]] for the soundtrack. Despite these accolades, box office returns for the film were disappointing.

===''Vanilla Sky''===
He followed ''Almost Famous'' with the psychological thriller ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' in 2001. The film starred [[Tom Cruise]], [[Penélope Cruz]], and [[Cameron Diaz]], the film received mixed reviews but still managed to gross $100.6&nbsp;million at the US box office, making it his second highest grossing directorial effort behind only ''Jerry Maguire.'' ''Vanilla Sky'' is a remake of [[Alejandro Amenabar]]'s 1997 Spanish film ''Abre Los Ojos'' (''[[Open Your Eyes (1997 film)|Open your Eyes]]''). Sofia is played by [[Penélope Cruz]] in both Amenabar's original movie and Crowe's remake.

===''Elizabethtown''===
He returned in 2005, with the romantic tragicomedy ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'' starring [[Orlando Bloom]] and [[Kirsten Dunst]], which opened to mixed reviews again,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elizabethtown/ |title=Elizabethtown |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> scoring 45 on [[Metacritic]], the same as his previous effort, ''Vanilla Sky''.

===''The Union''===
In November 2009, Crowe began filming a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the album ''The Union'', a collaboration between musicians [[Elton John]] and [[Leon Russell]] produced by award-winning producer [[T-Bone Burnett]]. The documentary features musicians [[Neil Young]], [[Brian Wilson]], [[Booker T. Jones]], steel guitarist [[Robert Randolph (guitarist)|Robert Randolph]], [[Don Was]] and a 10-piece gospel choir who all appear on the album with John and Russell. Musician [[Stevie Nicks]] and John's longtime lyricist [[Bernie Taupin]] also appear. On March 2, 2011, the documentary was announced to open the 2011 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/tribeca-opens-fest-with-cameron-crowes-the-union/ |title=Tribeca Opens With Cameron Crowe's 'The Union' |publisher=Deadline.com |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=March 2, 2011 | first=Mike | last=Fleming}}</ref>

===''We Bought a Zoo''===
With production on ''Aloha'' delayed, Crowe set his next feature, the family comedy-drama ''[[We Bought a Zoo]]'', based on Benjamin Mee's [[We Bought a Zoo (book)|memoir of the same name]]. Crowe collaborated with ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'' writer [[Aline Brosh McKenna]] on the screenplay.<ref name="slashfilm.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2010/06/23/matt-damon-in-talks-to-join-cameron-crowes-zoo/ |title= Matt Damon in Talks to Join Cameron Crowe’s Zoo |first= Peter |last= Sciretta |publisher= Slash Film |date= June 23, 2010 |accessdate= December 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389137/fullcredits#writers |title= We Bought a Zoo (2011) – Full credits – writers |publisher= Internet Movie DataBase |date= |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref> The book's story follows Mee, who buys and moves into a dilapidated zoo (now [[Dartmoor Zoological Park]]) in the English countryside.

The film received a wide release on December 23, 2011 by [[20th Century Fox]], and starred [[Matt Damon]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. The film has received positive reviews. The music of the movie was composed by [[Jonsi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1389137/fullcredits |title= We Bought a Zoo (2011) – Full credits |publisher= Internet Movie DataBase |date= |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}</ref>

===''Pearl Jam Twenty''===
{{main|Pearl Jam Twenty}}
In an interview with [[Pearl Jam]] on March 9, 2009, bassist [[Jeff Ament]] said "...&nbsp;our manager Kelly has had the idea to do a 20-year anniversary retrospective movie so he's been on board with [film director] Cameron Crowe for the last few years."<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/music/music-news/2009/03/09/q-a-session-with-pearl-jam-86908-21184381/ |title=Q+A session with Pearl Jam |publisher=Daily Record |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> The band's guitarist [[Mike McCready]] also stated in March, "We are just in the very early stages of that, . . . starting to go through all the footage we have, and Cameron’s writing the treatment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twofeetthick.com/2009/03/mike-talks-to-seattle-weekly/ |title=Mike Talks Possible PJ/Cameron Crowe Film |publisher=TwoFeetThick.com |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> Preliminary footage was being shot as of June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twofeetthick.com/2010/06/cameron-crowe-hits-the-streets-for-pearl-jam/ |title=Cameron Crowe Hits The Streets For Pearl Jam |publisher=TwoFeetThick.com |date=1992-11-01 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref>  A trailer for the movie, which featured Pearl Jam frontman [[Eddie Vedder]] choosing between three permanent markers in a shop before turning to the camera and saying "Three's good...

===''Aloha''===
{{main|Aloha (film)}}
It was announced in early June 2008 that Crowe would return to write and direct his seventh feature film, initially titled ''Deep Tiki'' and ''Volcano Romance'', set to star [[Ben Stiller]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]], and to be released by [[Columbia Pictures]]. Filming was expected to begin in January 2009,<ref>Fleming, Michael and Tatiana Siegel. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987103.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 "Stiller, Witherspoon fly with Crowe"].
