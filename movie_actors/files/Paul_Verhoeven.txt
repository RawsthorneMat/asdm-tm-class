'''Paul Verhoeven''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈpʌu̯l vərˈɦuvə(n)|lang}}; born 18 July 1938) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[film director]], [[screenwriter]], and [[film producer|producer]] who has made movies in the Netherlands and the [[United States]].

Explicit violent and/or sexual content and social satire are trademarks of both his [[drama film|drama]] and [[science fiction film]]s. He is best known in the U.S. for directing the science fiction films ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), and ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'' (1997), and the erotic thriller ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992).

Verhoeven's film ''[[Turkish Delight (film)|Turkish Delight]]'' (1973) received the award for Best Dutch Film of the Century at the [[Netherlands Film Festival]].<ref name="century">[http://www.filmfestival.nl/goud/goud002.html]; Winners of the [[Netherlands Film Festival]]</ref> His films altogether received a total of nine [[Academy Award]] nominations, mainly for editing and effects. Verhoeven won the [[Saturn Award for Best Director]] for ''Robocop''. His Dutch war film ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006) was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]], and was voted the best Dutch film ever by the Dutch public in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.nl/artikelen/4084816/zwartboek-beste-film-aller-tijden |title=Zwartboek beste film aller tijden - Cinema.nl Nieuws |language= nl |publisher=Cinema.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>

In contrast, he won the [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995); he is one of the few people to have [[List of people who have accepted Golden Raspberry Awards|accepted their award(s) in person.]]

The ''[[Seattle Times]]'' praised Verhoeven by saying, "Director Paul Verhoeven often appears to be a one-man Dutch movie industry,"<ref>{{cite news |last= Hartl |first= John |title= ''THE FOURTH MAN'' Is Occult Thriller That Holds Suspense |work= [[The Seattle Times]] |location= Seattle |publisher= Seattle Times Company |date= June 7, 1985 |page= 22}}</ref> while ''[[U-T San Diego|The San Diego Union]]'' called Verhoeven "a busy bee whose movies pollinate the festival circuit."<ref>{{cite news |last= Elliott |first= David |title= ''The Fourth Man'' is half-baked film |work= San Diego Union |location= |publisher= |date= July 20, 1984 |url= |accessdate= January 27, 2013}}</ref>

==Early life==
Paul Verhoeven was born on 18 July 1938 in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. He is the son of [[Teacher|school teacher]] Wim Verhoeven and [[Hatmaking|hat maker]] Nel van Schaardenburg. Although he was born in Amsterdam, the family lived in the village of [[Slikkerveer]].

In 1943 the family moved to [[The Hague]], the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during [[World War II]]. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with [[V-weapons|V1 and V2-rocket launchers]], which was repeatedly bombed by allied forces. Their neighbours' house was hit and Verhoeven's parents were almost killed when bombs fell on a street crossing. From this period, Verhoeven mentioned in interviews, he remembers images of violence, burning houses, dead bodies on the street, and continuous danger. As a small child he experienced the war as an exciting adventure and compares himself with the character Bill Rowan in ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987).<ref name="oorlog">[http://www.ethesis.net/verhoeven/verhoeven_deel_1.htm ''Een beetje oorlog, best spannend''], 2003; accessed on October 17, 2006</ref>

Verhoeven's father Wim Verhoeven became [[head teacher]] at the [[Van Heutszschool]] in The Hague, and Paul Verhoeven attended this school. Sometimes they watched informative films at home with the school's [[Movie projector|film projector]]. Paul Verhoeven and his father also liked to see American films that were in the cinema after the liberation, such as ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'' (1952). They went as many as ten times to see ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953). Paul Verhoeven was a fan of the Dutch comic ''[[Dick Bos]]'' ([[:nl:Dick Bos|nl]]). The character Dick Bos is a [[private detective]] who fights crime using [[jujutsu]]. Verhoeven himself liked comic drawing; he created ''The Killer'', a ''grey'' character in a detailed story full of revenge. Other fiction he liked were ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs|Rice Burroughs]] ''[[Barsoom]]'' series.<ref name="oorlog"/>

Verhoeven attended public secondary school [[Gymnasium Haganum]] in The Hague. Later, beginning in 1955, he studied at [[Leiden University]], where he joined the students' corps. Verhoeven graduated with a [[doctorandus]] (M.Sc.) with a double major, in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].<ref name="msc1">[http://www.paulverhoeven.net/index2.asp Paul Verhoeven.net - all about a unique director]</ref><ref name="msc2">[http://www.wiskundemeisjes.nl/20060913/paul-verhoeven/ ''Wiskundemeisjes'' » Paul Verhoeven]</ref>

==Career==

===Short films and TV series (1960–1969)===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Screenshot A Lizzard Too Much.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from ''A Lizzard Too Much'' (1960)]] -->
Verhoeven made his first film ''A Lizzard Too Much'' for the anniversary of his students' corps in 1960.<ref>[http://www.gonemovies.com/WWW/TopFilms/Verhoeven/RegiseurVerhoeven.asp Paul Verhoeven - Biography]</ref> In his last years at university Verhoeven also attended classes at the [[Netherlands Film and Television Academy|Netherlands Film Academy]]. After this he made three more short films ''Nothing Special'' (1961), ''The Hitchhikers'' (1962) and ''Let's Have a Party'' (1963).

Verhoeven never used his math and physics degree, opting instead to invest his energies in a career in film. After his studies he entered the Dutch [[Navy]] as a conscript. He made the documentary "Het Korps Mariniers" (''The Royal Dutch Marine Corps'', 1965) about the Navy, which won the French ''Golden Sun'' award for military films.<ref name="oorlog"/>

In 1967 Verhoeven married Martine Tours, with whom he later had two daughters, Claudia (b. 1972), and Helen (b. 1974).

When he left the Navy, Verhoeven took his skills to Dutch television. First, he made a documentary about [[Anton Mussert]] named ''Mussert'' (1968). His first major success was the 1969 ''[[Floris (TV series)|Floris]]'' television series, starring [[Rutger Hauer]]. The concept of ''Floris'' was inspired by foreign series like ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' and ''[[Thierry La Fronde]]''.

===First feature films (1969–1983)===
Verhoeven's first feature film ''[[Business Is Business (film)|Business Is Business]]'' was released in 1971 and was not especially well received. His first national success did not come until 1973 with ''[[Turkish Delight (film)|Turkish Delight]]'', starring [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Monique van de Ven]]. This film is based on a novel by bestselling Dutch author [[Jan Wolkers]] and tells the passionate love story of an artist and a liberal young girl from a rather conservative background. The film received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1974. In 1999 the film won a [[Golden Calf (award)|Golden Calf]] for Best Dutch Film of the Century. Verhoeven's 1975 film ''[[Katie Tippel]]'' again featured Hauer and van de Ven, but it would not match the success of ''Turkish Delight''.
[[File:Paul Verhoeven (1980).jpg|thumb|Paul Verhoeven (1980)]]
Verhoeven built on his reputation and achieved international success with his [[Golden Globe]] nominated film ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'',<ref>[http://www.hfpa.org/browse/film/24971 HFPA - Awards Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> starring Rutger Hauer and [[Jeroen Krabbé]]. The film, based on a true story about the Dutch resistance in [[World War II]], was written by [[Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema]]. ''Soldier of Orange'' received the 1979 LA Film Critics Award for best foreign language film. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe in 1980.

In 1980 Verhoeven made the film ''[[Spetters]]'' with [[Renée Soutendijk]] and Rutger Hauer. The story is sometimes compared to ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', but the film has more explicit violence and sexuality (in this case also [[homosexuality]]), which are sometimes seen as the trademarks of Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven's film ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' (1983) is a horror film starring Jeroen Krabbé and [[Renée Soutendijk]]. It was written by [[Gerard Soeteman]] from a novel by the popular Dutch writer [[Gerard Reve]]. This film would be Verhoeven's last Dutch film production until the 2006 film ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]''.

===Filmmaking in the United States (1983–2000)===
Gerard Soeteman also wrote the script for Verhoeven's first American film, ''[[Flesh & Blood (film)|Flesh & Blood]]'' (1985), which starred Rutger Hauer and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. Verhoeven moved to [[Hollywood]] for a wider range of opportunities in filmmaking. Working in the U.S. he made a serious change in style, directing big-budget, very violent, special-effects-heavy smashes ''RoboCop'' and ''Total Recall'', at the time the most expensive film ever produced.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Both ''[[RoboCop]]'' and ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' won [[Academy Special Achievement Award]]s, for Sound Effects Editing and for Visual Effects respectively.

Verhoeven followed those successes with the equally intense and provocative ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), an erotic thriller. The ninth-highest grossing film of the year, the movie was a return to themes Verhoeven had explored in ''[[Turkish Delight (film)|Turkish Delight]]'' and ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]''. The film's most notorious scene shows Sharon Stone's character in a police interrogation, where she uncrosses her legs, briefly revealing her vulva (she does not wear underwear underneath her skirt). The film received two Academy Awards nominations, for Film Editing and for Original Music.<ref>[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1143590110752 Session Timeout - Academy Awards Database - AMPAS]</ref>

Verhoeven's next film was the poorly received, NC-17 rated ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), about a stripper in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] trying to make a career as a showgirl. The film won seven [[1995 Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Awards]] including Worst Film and Worst Director; Verhoeven became the first director to accept his "award" in person.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1996|title=Razzie Awards (1996) on IMDB}}</ref> Afterward, the film enjoyed success on the [[home video]] market, generating more than $100 million from video rentals <ref>Wiser, Paige. "The beauty of 'Showgirls'", ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', July 27, 2004</ref> and became one of [[MGM]]'s top 20 all-time bestsellers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=SHOWGRLS  |title=MGM's official page for Showgirls DVD |publisher=classic-web.archive.org |date=2007-04-28 |accessdate=2010-11-25 |archiveurl = http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070428172642/http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=SHOWGRLS |archivedate = 2007-04-28}}</ref>

After ''Basic Instinct'' and ''Showgirls'', Verhoeven returned to the science fiction, graphic violence, and special-effects tropes that had marked his earlier films with ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'' (1997), adapted from the controversial novel of the same name by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], and ''[[Hollow Man]]'' (2000). Each film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects.

===Return to the Netherlands (2006–present)===
After about 20 years of working and living in the United States, Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands for the shooting of a new film. Together with his screenwriter [[Gerard Soeteman]], Verhoeven made ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006). The director was hailed by the host of the [[Netherlands Film Festival]] with the words "The return of a hero".<ref>[http://www.filmfestival.nl/index.php?id=591 Gala van de Nederlandse Film], October 6, 2006; accessed October 17, 2006</ref> ''Black Book'' eventually won six [[Golden Calf (award)|Golden Calves]] at this festival, including Best Director.<ref>[http://www.filmfestival.nl/index.php?id=122&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=163&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=103&cHash=80798b911c Winnaars Gouden Kalveren 2006], October 6, 2006; accessed October 17, 2006</ref> When the shooting of ''Black Book'' was delayed due to financial issues, there was speculation about a new production. The film ''[[Beast of Bataan]]'' had been announced, but once the shooting for ''Black Book'' resumed, the other film was never realized. Since his return to European cinema in 2006 with ''Black Book'', Verhoeven has been connected to a large number of projects, but for the moment none of them has come to fruition. Some of those titles were produced with other directors at the helm, such as ''[[The Paperboy (2012 film)|The Paperboy]]''.

Verhoeven has been a knight in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]] since 2007.<ref>{{nl icon}} "[http://www.omroepwest.nl/nieuws/27-04-2007/paul-verhoeven-geridderd-den-haag Paul Verhoeven geridderd in Den Haag]", ''Omroep West'', 2007. Retrieved on 12 February 2015.</ref>

==Other activities==
Verhoeven is a member of the [[Jesus Seminar]],<ref>See the Jesus Seminar website at http://www.westarinstitute.org/Fellows/fellows.html</ref> and he is the only member who does not have a degree in [[biblical studies]].<ref name="dutchpressrelease">[http://www.katholieknederland.nl/actualiteit/2005/detail_objectID571964_FJaar2005.html Paul Verhoeven schrijft boek over Jezus] Dutch press release on the writing of his book.</ref> He graduated with a degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Leiden.<ref>Hakkenes, Emiel ''[http://meer.trouw.nl/nieuws-en-debat/verhoeven-niet-echt-zeer-geleerd Verhoeven is niet echt zeer geleerd]'' in [[Trouw]] 24 October 2008  Engl. translation: "Verhoeven would have received his academic degree at the University of Leiden. But did he receive a doctor's degree? "Then we sould have a dissertation", says a spokesperson of the university. "This is not the case." Dutch original: "Zijn academische titel zou Verhoeven behaald hebben aan de Universiteit Leiden. Maar is hij wel gepromoveerd? „Dan zouden wij een proefschrift van hem moeten hebben”, zegt een woordvoerder van de universiteit. „Dat is niet het geval.” "</ref><ref name="senses">{{cite web|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/great-directors/verhoeven/|title=critique by professor Dan Shaw|publisher=SensesofCinema.com|first=Dan|last=shaw|accessdate=28 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071117150942/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/03/verhoeven.html |archivedate = November 17, 2007}}</ref>  Since he is not a professional biblical exegete, his membership in the Jesus Seminar has occasionally been cited by opponents of the Seminar as a sign that this group is less scholarly than it claims.<ref>For example, ''The Real Jesus'' by [[Luke Timothy Johnson]] (SF: HarperSanFrancisco, 1997) criticizes the Jesus Seminar's methods on exegetical grounds, and also criticizes what he perceives to be a dependence on the theatrical and an attempt to manipulate the mainstream media.  He singles out Verhoeven as a key player in the media activities of the Jesus Seminar on pp. 15–16 of this book.</ref> On the other hand, some Jesus Seminar members were unhappy with Verhoeven's portrayal of Jesus as an [[Eschatology|eschatological]] [[prophet]].<ref>Charlotte Allen, "Away With The Manger", in ''Lingua Franca'' (Feb. /1995), p. 27.</ref>

In 2007 Verhoeven wrote the book ''Jesus of Nazareth'' ({{lang-nl|Jezus van Nazaret}}) about the life of Jesus of Nazareth.<ref>published by Netherlands company [http://www.bijleveldbooks.nl/html/fondslijst.html Fondslijst Uitgeverij Bijleveld]{{Dead link|date=November 2008}}</ref> The book reviews the ideas of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]] and the alleged corruption of these same ideas over the last 2,000 years. Co-written with Verhoeven's biographer Rob Van Scheers, the book is the culmination of the research Verhoeven conducted in preparation for ''Jesus: The Man'', a motion picture about the life of Christ.<ref name="dutchpressrelease"/> The book tells about the Jewish uprising against Roman rule and characterizes Jesus as a radical political activist, downplaying any supernatural events and miracles as unproved or unprovable. ''Jesus of Nazareth: A Realistic Portrait'' was released in September 2008 in Dutch and was published in English in May 2010 by [[Seven Stories Press]].<ref>[http://www.sevenstories.com/book/?GCOI=58322100101470 Jesus of Nazareth], at Seven Stories Press</ref>

Robert J. Miller, author of ''Born Divine'', said about ''Jesus of Nazareth'', "Verhoeven breaks down the gospels...and reassembles them into a unique...reconstruction of the historical Jesus."<ref name = "MillerGoogle">[http://books.google.com/books?id=Fixaz4TcB3oC&pg=PP2&lpg=PP2&dq=robert+j.+miller+paul+verhoeven+jesus+of+nazareth+review&source=bl&ots=qc7G4HWtoz&sig=fhfGW2Aoz1qeX26HbANQwjqCnQc&hl=en&ei=rXV7TuuODsLt0gHd4qGwAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false] by Paul Verhoeven, "Google Books"</ref>

In April 2010, Verhoeven hinted that his next potential film project would be an adaptation of a "Hitchcockian" computer game set in 1914. Although he would not reveal the title, there was speculation that the project might be an adaptation of ''[[The Last Express]]'', a 1997 game designed by ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' creator [[Jordan Mechner]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Verhoeven Developing Big Screen Adaptation of… Jordan Mechner’s Video Game The Last Express?|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/paul-verhoeven-developing-big-screen-adaptation-of-jordan-mechners-video-game-the-last-express/|publisher=/Film}}</ref> In October 2011, Verhoeven confirmed ''The Last Express'' as the identity of the game in question, and revealed that he is even considering filming it in 3D.<ref>{{youtube|vcXp3r63WIw|Paul Verhoeven Talks 3D During MIPCOM}}</ref> Mechner has gone on record as saying he is a fan of Verhoeven's ''Jesus of Nazareth'' (JON).<ref>[http://jordanmechner.com/blog/2011/12/good-books-to-buy-for-geeks-like-me Good Books to Buy for Geeks Like Me]</ref> Verhoeven's interpretation of JON will reportedly include Jesus as an exorcist, and a believer in the Kingdom of God on Earth.
