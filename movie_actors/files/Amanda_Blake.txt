'''Amanda Blake''' (February 20, 1929&nbsp;– August 16, 1989) was an American actress best known for the role of the red-haired saloon proprietress "Miss Kitty Russell" on the television western ''[[Gunsmoke]]''. She and her third husband Frank Gilbert ran one of the first successful programs for breeding [[cheetah]]s in captivity.

==Early life and career==
Amanda Blake was born '''Beverly Louise Neill''' in [[Buffalo, New York]], the only child of Jesse and Louise (née Puckett) Neill. Her father was a banker, and she was a [[Switchboard operator|telephone operator]] before taking up acting.  [[Kate Barry|Catherine ″Kate" Moore Barry]] (1752-1823), one of her ancestors, was a heroine of the [[American Revolutionary War]].  She warned local patriots of [[Banastre Tarleton]]'s approach, giving them time to group and prepare for the [[Battle of Cowpens]] (January 17, 1781), a major American victory which helped pave the way for the British defeat at Yorktown. Blake placed a cameo-sized portrait of Barry owned by her family in the [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]] local history museum, where it remains on display to this day. {{cn|date=August 2014}}

Nicknamed "the Young [[Greer Garson]],"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/96-Greer.htm|title=Gunsmoke|publisher=GunsmokeNet.com|accessdate=2010-08-15|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100928122931/http://gunsmokenet.com/GunsmokeTGAW/Marks-Stuff/Gunsmoke/shots/96-Greer.htm| archivedate=September 28, 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> she became best known for her 19-year stint as the saloon-keeper Miss Kitty on the television series ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' from 1955-74. 

In 1968, Blake was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/info/awards-hof/Western-Performers.aspx|title=Great Western Performers|publisher=Nationalcowboymuseum.org|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref> She was the third performer inducted, after [[Tom Mix]] and [[Gary Cooper]], selected in 1958 and 1966, respectively.

Due to her continuing role on television, Blake rarely had time for films. She appeared in a TV comedy routine with [[Red Skelton]] and was a panelist on the long-running ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' and ''[[Match Game]] 74'', as well as making comedy appearances on the [[Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]. In 1957, she guest-starred as Betty Lavon-Coate in the episode titled "Coate of Many Colors" on [[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]]'s crime drama, ''[[State Trooper (TV series)|State Trooper]]''. After the ''Gunsmoke'' reunion film, she made two feature film appearances: in ''[[The Boost]]'', a drug-addiction drama starring [[James Woods]] and [[Sean Young]], and in ''B.O.R.N'' (both 1988).<ref name="imdb">{{IMDb name|0086469}}</ref>

==Animal welfare==
After ''Gunsmoke,'' Blake went into semi-retirement at her home in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], taking on only a few film and TV projects. She said she wanted to devote more time to her animals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Amanda Blake gets 5 baby cheetahs|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&dat=19741219&id=pR5UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8owDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5418,7006689|accessdate=August 25, 2013|newspaper=Boca Raton News|date=December 19, 1974}}</ref> She had been known for bringing her pet [[lion]] Kemo onto the ''Gunsmoke'' set.<ref>{{cite news|last=Browning|first=Norma Lee|title=Amanda Blake's Lion Upsets 'Gunsmoke' Set|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19740226&id=0fNOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7368,667843|accessdate=August 25, 2013|newspaper=Toledo Blade|date=February 26, 1974}}</ref> He lived in an animal compound at her home where Blake and her husband Frank Gilbert also ran an experimental breeding program for cheetahs. They were one of the first to breed cheetahs successfully in captivity, and raised seven generations of cheetahs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Caras|first=Roger A.|title=A Perfect Harmony: The Intertwining Lives of Animals and Humans Throughout History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wIx-ebQa9J4C&pg=PA195|year=2001|publisher=Purdue University Press|isbn=978-1-55753-241-1|pages=194–195}}</ref>

Blake joined with others to form the Arizona Animal Welfare League in 1971, today the oldest and largest "no-kill" [[animal shelter]] in the state. In 1985, she helped finance the start-up of the [[Performing Animal Welfare Society]] (PAWS) and devoted a great deal of time and money in support of its efforts, including travels to [[Africa]]. Blake reportedly was a one-time board member of the [[Humane Society of the United States]]. In 1997, the Amanda Blake Memorial Wildlife Refuge opened at Rancho Seco Park in [[Herald, California]]. The refuge provides sanctuary for free-ranging African [[Ungulate|hoofed wildlife]], most of whom were originally destined for exotic animal [[auction]]s or hunting [[ranches]].<ref>[http://www.pawsweb.org/amanda_blake_memorial.html The Amanda Blake Memorial Wildlife Refuge website]; accessed August 28, 2014.</ref>

==Declining health and death==
Blake had been a heavy [[Cigarette smoking|cigarette smoker]] and had surgery for [[oral cancer]] in 1977. She became a supporter of the [[American Cancer Society]] and made fundraising appearances throughout the country. In 1984, she was the recipient of the society's annual Courage Award.<ref>{{cite news|title=Amanda Blake, 60, Saloonkeeper On TV's 'Gunsmoke' for 19 Years|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/18/obituaries/amanda-blake-60-saloonkeeper-on-tv-s-gunsmoke-for-19-years.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 18, 1989}}</ref>

According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', Blake died on August 16, 1989, from complications of [[AIDS]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/08/us/amanda-blake-died-of-aids-doctor-says.html|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Amanda Blake Died of AIDS, Doctor Says|date=November 8, 1989}}</ref> There was some confusion over the exact cause of her death. When she died at Mercy General Hospital in Sacramento, California, a statement by the hospital and some of her friends reported the cause of death as cancer. Blake's death certificate, however, listed the immediate cause as cardiopulmonary arrest due to liver failure and CMV ([[cytomegalovirus]]) [[hepatitis]]. CMV hepatitis is [[AIDS-related complications|AIDS-related]]. The facts of her death from AIDS-related complications were reported in ''[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]]'' the same year she died, being detailed by other friends and her main doctor.<ref name=people>{{cite journal|last1=Stark|first1=John|last2=Hoover|first2=Eleanor|title=Friends—and Her Doctor—say AIDS, Not Cancer, Killed Gunsmoke's Amanda Blake|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20115981,00.html|journal=People|volume=32|issue=21|date=November 20, 1989}}</ref>
