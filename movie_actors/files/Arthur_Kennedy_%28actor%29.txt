'''Arthur Kennedy''' (February 17, 1914{{spaced ndash}}January 5, 1990) was an [[United States|American]] stage and film actor known for his versatility in supporting film roles and his ability to create "an exceptional honesty and naturalness on stage", especially in the original casts of [[Arthur Miller]] plays on Broadway.<ref name=NYTObit>James C. McKinley Jr., "Arthur Kennedy, Actor, 75, Dies; Was Versatile in Supporting Roles", The New York Times, 7 Jan 1990, p 30, via ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2007) accessed 13 November 2011.</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Kennedy was born John Arthur Kennedy on 17 February 1914 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], the son of Helen (née Thompson) and J.T. Kennedy, a dentist. He attended South High School, Worcester and [[Worcester Academy]]. At [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]], Pittsburgh he studied drama being graduated B.A. in 1934.<ref name=ANB>Melissa Vickery-Bareford, [http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-01923.html "Kennedy, John Arthur"], ''American National Biography Online'', (Feb. 2000), accessed 13 Nov 13 2011.</ref>

==Career==
Kennedy moved to New York and, billed as John Kennedy, joined the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]]. He then toured with a classical repertory company. In September 1937, he made his Broadway debut as Bushy in [[Maurice Evans (actor)|Maurice Evans']] ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' at the [[St. James Theatre]]. In 1939 he played Sir Richard Vernon in Evans' ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]''.<ref name=ANB/>

Kennedy got his break when he was discovered by [[James Cagney]]. His first film role was of Cagney's younger brother in ''[[City for Conquest]]'' in 1940. He was equally adept as hero or villain, and was noted for his mastery of complex, multi-faceted roles.  He appeared in many [[Western film]]s and police dramas. 

During [[World War]] from 1943 to 1945, Kennedy served in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] making aviation training films, both as a narrator and an actor. Many of those films today serve as an historical record of not only how aviators were trained but also how the equipment was operated. 

He appeared in many notable films from the early 1940s through to the mid-1960s, including ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'', ''[[Champion (1949 film)|Champion]]'', ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'', ''[[The Glass Menagerie (1950 film)|The Glass Menagerie]]'', ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[Peyton Place (film)|Peyton Place]]'', ''[[Some Came Running]]'', ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]'' and ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]''.

Of Kennedy's film work, he is perhaps best-remembered for his collaborations with director [[Anthony Mann]] and co-star [[James Stewart]] on ''[[Bend of the River]]'' (1952) and ''[[The Man from Laramie]]'' (1955). In both films he played sympathetic villains. 

He also enjoyed a distinguished stage career over the same period, receiving a [[Tony Award]] for the role of [[Biff Loman]] in [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' (1949). Kennedy also inaugurated three other major characters in Miller plays: Chris Keller in ''[[All My Sons]]'' (1947), [[John Proctor (convicted witch)|John Proctor]] in ''[[The Crucible]]'' (1953), and [[Walter Franz]] in ''[[The Price (play)|The Price]]'' (1968). In 1961 he played the title role in ''[[Becket]]'', opposite [[Laurence Olivier]] as Henry II.

On February 5, 1959, Kennedy appeared on the episode "Make It Look Good" of [[CBS]]'s ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater]]''. Kennedy plays Sam Carter, a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hired as a bank teller in an otherwise all-Union community by the banker Clem Doud, portrayed by [[Parley Baer]]. It is revealed that Carter, widely disliked in the town, had for a time been a [[prisoner of war]] at [[Elmira Prison|Elmira]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Carter becomes the inside partner to two brothers, played by [[Ed Nelson]] and [[Richard Rust]], who rob the bank, but he changes his mind and does not take part in the splitting of the $30,000 loot. Carter must confront Russ Bowen, one of the brothers who had vowed to harm Carter's wife, Jenny, portrayed by  [[Jacqueline Scott]]. [[Robert F. Simon]] plays Sheriff John Hanley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0754257/|title=''Zane Grey Theatre'': "Make It Look Good", February 5, 1959|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}</ref>

In 1974, Kennedy was a regular in the cast of the short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[police drama]] ''[[Nakia (TV series)|Nakia]]'', portraying Sheriff Sam Jericho.
