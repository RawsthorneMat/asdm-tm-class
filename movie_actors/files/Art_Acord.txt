'''Arthemus Ward "Art" Acord''' (April 17, 1890 â€“ January 4, 1931) was an [[United States|American]] [[silent film]] actor and [[rodeo]] champion. After his film career ended in 1929, Acord worked in rodeo [[Travelling exhibition|road shows]] and as a [[miner]] in Mexico.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Sky High Corral lobby card.jpg|thumb|Acord in ''Sky High Corral'', 1926]]
Art (Artumus Ward) Acord was born to [[Mormon]] parents (Valentine Louis Acord and Mary Amelia Petersen) in [[Glenwood, Utah]]. As a young man, Acord worked as a [[cowboy]] and ranch hand. He won the World Champion [[Steer Wrestling]] ([[Steer wrestling|Bulldogging]]) at the Pendleton Roundup in 1912 and repeated as champion in 1916, defeating challenger and friend [[Hoot Gibson]].

Acord was one of the few cowboys to have ridden the proclaimed bucking horse Steamboat (who later inspired the bucking horse logo on the Wyoming license plate) for the full eight seconds. His rodeo skills had been sharpened when he worked for a time for the Miller Brothers' traveling [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch|101 Ranch Wild West Show]]. It was with the 101 that he became friends with [[Tom Mix]], [[Bee Ho Gray]], [[Broncho Billy Anderson|"Broncho Billy" Anderson]] and [[Hoot Gibson]]. He went on to become a noted actor in silent [[Western (genre)|Western film]]s. Accord also performed as a [[stunt man]]. He made over 100 film shorts, most of which are now considered [[Lost film|lost]].

Acord enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in [[World War I]] and served overseas. He was awarded the [[Croix de Guerre]] for bravery. At war's end, he returned to the motion picture business, appearing in a series of popular [[short film|film shorts]] and as "Buck Parvin", the title character for a [[Universal Pictures]] [[Serial (film)|serial]]. Because of a [[alcoholism|heavy drinking problem]] and his inability to adapt to the advent of [[talkies]], Acord's film career declined and he ended up performing in road shows and mining in Mexico.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&dat=19310105&id=iM9XAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zfQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5002,842027&hl=en|title=Art Acord Is Dead|date=January 5, 1931|work=Spokane Daily Chronicle|page=1|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref> In March, 1928, Acord had been seriously burned in an explosion at his home; the loss of his sight was feared.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19280319&id=JDIbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rUsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2732,2348068&hl=en|title=Film Actor Burned|date=March 19, 1928|work=The Pittsburgh Press|page=1|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>
