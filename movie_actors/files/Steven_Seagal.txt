A 7th-[[Dan (rank)|dan]] [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[Aikido]], Seagal began his adult life as an Aikido instructor in [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Steven Seagal Gets a Shot at Stardom |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1988-02-14|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-14/entertainment/ca-42829_1_steven-seagal|accessdate=2010-11-25|first=Patrick|last=Goldstein}}</ref> He became the first foreigner to operate an Aikido [[dojo]] in Japan.<ref name="British Aikido History">{{cite web|url=http://britishaikido.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=88|title=British Aikido History - Segal an Aikido Dojo in Japan ?|publisher=British Aikido|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812212652/http://britishaikido.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=88|archive-date=12 August 2011|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref>

He later moved to the [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], area where he made his film debut in 1988 in ''[[Above the Law (film)|Above the Law]]''. By 1991, he had starred in three successful films and achieved fame in ''[[Under Siege]]'' (1992), where he played [[Navy SEALs]] counter-terrorist expert [[Casey Ryback]]. However both ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'' (1994, which he directed) and ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]'' (1995) did less well at the [[box office]]. During the latter half of the 1990s, he starred in three more theatrical films and the [[direct-to-video]] (in the US) film ''[[The Patriot (1998 film)|The Patriot]]''. Since that time, with the exception of ''[[Exit Wounds]]'' (2001) and ''[[Half Past Dead]]'' (2002), his career has shifted almost entirely to direct-to-video films (often low budget productions and shot in Europe or Asia). From 1998 to 2014, he appeared in a total of 27 of these. At the age of 59, he returned to the big screen as Torrez in the 2010 film ''[[Machete (film)|Machete]]''. Intermittently between 2009 and 2013, he filmed three seasons of his reality show ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]'', which depicted Seagal performing his duties as a reserve deputy sheriff in [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana]] (season 1–2) and [[Maricopa County, Arizona]] (season 3). He also created and starred in two seasons of the undercover police drama series ''[[True Justice]]'' between 2011 and 2012.

Seagal is a guitarist, recording artist, and the founder of Steven Seagal Enterprises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bevnet.com/news/2005/08-22-2005-Steven_Seagal%20.asp|title=Steven Seagal Enterprises Launches New Line of Energy Drinks}}</ref> In addition to his professional achievements, he is also known as an [[environmentalism|environmentalist]],<ref>http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2012/01/steven-seagal-six-things-to-know/</ref> an [[animal rights]] activist, and a supporter of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzin Gyatso]].<ref name="NPR 2007-10-16">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15321257|title=Dalai Lama Draws Strong Reactions on Both Sides|last1=Flintoff|first1=Corey|authorlink1=Corey Flintoff|date=16 October 2007|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="Vogue Italia 2010-04-13">{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.it/en/people-are-talking-about/that-s-too-much/2010/04/steven-seagal

==Early life==
Seagal was born in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]], Michigan, where he lived until he was five years old, when the family moved to California. His mother, Patricia (1930–2003), was a medical technician, and his father, Samuel Steven Seagal (1928–1991), was a high school math teacher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/44/Steven-Seagal.html |title=Steven Seagal Biography (1952?-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref> His mother was of Irish ancestry and his father was [[Jews|Jewish]] (the son of immigrants from [[Russia]]).<ref name="jewish">{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/scams/steven_seagal/index.html|title=Steven Seagal and the mob|accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref> In a Russian interview, Seagal stated that he had a Mongolian grandfather (either [[Buryat people|Buryat]] or [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]]).<ref name="EC">{{cite web|url=http://savetibet.ru/2007/12/17/steven_seagal.html |title=Steven Seagal's Mongolian heritage |publisher=savetibet.ru |date=2009-08-15 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref> His parents relocated to [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], California, where Seagal attended [[Buena Park High School]] in [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]].

==Aikido==
At the age of 13, Seagal lied about his age and got a job as a dishwasher at a restaurant named ''The Wagon Wheel''.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} One of the cooks at the restaurant was a Japanese [[shotokan karate]] expert and noticed Seagal moved very quickly around the kitchen. He taught Seagal the basics of karate. Seagal began training in aikido under master [[Harry Kiyoshi Ishisaka]], founder of the Orange County Aikido School (Orange County Aiki Kai) (OCAK) in 1964. Seagal considers him to have been the most important martial arts teacher in his life. Seagal moved to Japan at some point between the ages of 19 and 21 with his father who was visiting for military purposes, and met karate masters and decided to remain in Japan. He received his 1st [[dan (rank)|dan]] degree ([[Shodan (rank)|Shodan]]) under the direction of [[Koichi Tohei]]. He continued to train in aikido as a student of [[Seiseki Abe]], Tohei (whose aikido organization, [[Ki Society]], Seagal refused to join in favor of staying with the [[Aikikai]]), [[Kisaburo Osawa]], [[Hiroshi Isoyama]] and the second [[Dōshu|doshu]] [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]]. He attained a 7th dan degree and [[Shihan]] in aikido and became the first foreigner to operate an aikido dojo in Japan.<ref>{{cite news|title= Sure, He's Making a Box-Office Killing—but Who Is Steven Seagal?|work=[[People (American magazine)|People]]|date=|url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113675,00.html|accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>

After returning to California in 1974, Seagal met Miyako Fujitani, an aikido instructor teaching in Los Angeles.  He returned with her to her native Japan in 1975 where they married.  When Seagal's father-in-law, also an aikido instructor, retired, Seagal became the new head of the organization known as Tenshin Aikido in [[Jūsō]], [[Osaka City]] (affiliated with the Aikikai). Seagal is known by his students as '''Take Sensei'''. When Seagal left his dojo in Osaka, his then-wife Miyako became the caretaker of the dojo which has continued to the present day. Seagal initially returned to [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[New Mexico]], with his student (and later film stuntman) Craig Dunn, where they opened a dojo, although Seagal spent much of his time pursuing other ventures. After another period in Japan, Seagal returned to the U.S. in 1983 with senior student Haruo Matsuoka. They opened an aikido dojo, initially in [[North Hollywood, California|North Hollywood]], California, but later moved it to the city of [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]]. Seagal left Matsuoka in charge of the dojo, which he ran until the two parted ways in 1997.<ref name="Black Belt 2011-06-09">{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltmag.com/daily/martial-arts-entertainment/martial-art-movies/haruo-matsuoka-on-steven-seagal-and-aikido%E2%80%99s-history-in-america/|title=Haruo Matsuoka on Steven Seagal and Aikido’s History in America|last1=Cheng|first1=Mark|authorlink1=Mark Cheng|date=9 June 2011|publisher=[[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]]|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="Brazil Times 2010-08-25">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebraziltimes.com/story/1659515.html|title=Aikido Institute hosting seminar with renowned martial artist|date=25 August 2010|publisher=Brazil Times|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="Black Belt April 2004">{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Mark|authorlink1=Mark Cheng|date=April 2004|title=Thundering AIKIDO: Former Steven Seagal Protégé Haruo Matsuoka Speaks About the Early Days of Aikido in America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ktsDAAAAMBAJ&pg=106|journal=[[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]]|publisher=Cheryl Angelheart|page=106|issn=0277-3066|oclc=4949089|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref>

==Hollywood career==

===1990s===
In 1987, Seagal began work on his first film, ''[[Above the Law (film)|Above the Law]]'' (titled ''Nico'' in Europe), with director [[Andrew Davis (filmmaker)|Andrew Davis]] and reportedly as a favor to a former aikido student, the agent [[Michael Ovitz]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Steven Seagal Gets a Shot at Stardom |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1988-02-14|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-14/entertainment/ca-42829_1_steven-seagal/3|accessdate=2010-11-29|first=Patrick|last=Goldstein}}</ref> Ovitz took Seagal to Warner Brothers to put on an aikido demonstration and the executives were impressed by him and offered him several scripts; Seagal turned them down but agreed to write what would become ''Above the Law''. Following its success, Seagal made three more movies – ''[[Hard to Kill]]'', ''[[Marked for Death]]'', and ''[[Out for Justice]]'' – that were box office hits, making him an [[action hero]]. Later, he achieved wider, mainstream success in 1992 with the release of ''[[Under Siege]]'' (1992). That film reunited Seagal with director Andrew Davis, and was a blockbuster in the U.S. and abroad, grossing $156.4 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110725/business |title=Business Data for ''Under Siege'' (1992)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>

Seagal then directed ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'' (1994). This film, in which he also starred, emphasized environmental and spiritual themes, signaling a break with his previous persona as a genre-ready inner-city cop. The film featured [[Michael Caine]] as well as [[R. Lee Ermey]] and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] in minor supporting roles. ''On Deadly Ground'' was poorly received by film critics,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/on_deadly_ground/ |title=On Deadly Ground |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref> but despite many critics denouncing Seagal's long environmental speech in the film, Seagal considers it to have been one of the most important and relevant moments in his career. Seagal filmed a sequel to one of his most successful films, ''Under Siege'', titled ''[[Under Siege 2: Dark Territory]]'' (1995), and cop drama ''[[The Glimmer Man]]'' (1996). In 1996, he had a role in the [[Kurt Russell]] film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which he played a special ops soldier who only appears in the film's first 45 minutes. He subsequently made another environmentally conscious film, ''[[Fire Down Below (1997 film)|Fire Down Below]]'' (1997), wherein he was an [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] agent fighting industrialists dumping toxic waste in the [[Kentucky]] hills, but the movie was commercially unsuccessful. This film ended his original multi-picture contract with [[Warner Bros.]]{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Direct-to-video work===
The next year, Seagal made ''[[The Patriot (1998 film)|The Patriot]]'', another environmental thriller which was his first [[direct to video|direct-to-video]] release in the United States (though it was released theatrically in most of the world). Seagal produced this film with his own money, and the film was shot on-location on and near his farm in [[Montana]].

After producing ''[[Prince of Central Park (2000 film)|Prince of Central Park]]'', Seagal returned to cinema screens with the release of ''[[Exit Wounds]]'' in March 2001. The film had fewer martial arts scenes than Seagal's previous films, but it was a commercial success, taking almost $80 million worldwide. However, he was unable to capitalize on this success and his next two projects were both critical and commercial failures. The movie ''[[Ticker (2001 film)|Ticker]]'', co-starring [[Tom Sizemore]] and [[Dennis Hopper]], was filmed in San Francisco before ''Exit Wounds'', and went straight to DVD. ''[[Half Past Dead]]'', starring [[Hip hop music|rap]] star [[Ja Rule]], made less than $20 million worldwide.

All of the films Seagal has made since the latter half of 2001 have been released direct-to-video (DTV) in North America, with some theatrical releases to other countries around the world. Seagal is credited as a producer and sometimes a writer on many of these DTV movies, which include ''[[Black Dawn (film)|Black Dawn]]'', ''[[Belly of the Beast]]'', ''[[Out of Reach (film)|Out of Reach]]'', ''[[Submerged]]'', ''[[Kill Switch (film)|Kill Switch]]'', ''[[Urban Justice]]'', ''[[Pistol Whipped]]'', ''[[Against the Dark]]'', ''[[Driven to Kill]]'', ''[[A Dangerous Man]]'', ''[[Born to Raise Hell (film)|Born to Raise Hell]]'' and ''[[The Keeper (2009 film)|The Keeper]]'', a movie released in Japan fifteen weeks earlier than the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1296869/releaseinfo|title=The Keeper (2009/I) – Release dates|year=2010|accessdate=2010-04-24|author=IMDB.com|work=IMDB.com}}</ref>

===Return to the big screen and television work===
In 2009, [[A&E Network]] premiered the reality television series; ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]'', focusing on Seagal as a deputy in [[Louisiana]]. In 2010, Seagal appeared in his first theatrically released film in nearly a decade, as the main villain in [[Robert Rodriguez]]' ''[[Machete (film)|Machete]]''. In 2011, he produced and starred in a 13-episode television series entitled ''[[True Justice]]''. It was renewed for a second season on [[ReelzChannel]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://deadline.com/2012/04/reelzchannel-orders-second-season-of-steven-seagals-true-justice-262369/ |title=ReelzChannel Orders Second Season Of Steven Seagal's 'True Justice' |date=April 26, 2012 |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva  |work=Deadline.com}}</ref> In the UK, ''True Justice'' has been repackaged as a series of DVD "movies," with each disc editing together two episodes.

==Themes and motifs==
Many of Seagal's films share unique elements which have become characteristic of his body of work. His characters often have an elite past affiliation with the [[CIA]], [[Special Forces]] or [[Black Ops]] (for example, Casey Ryback in ''[[Under Siege]]'', a former [[Navy SEAL]], Jack Cole in ''[[The Glimmer Man]]'', an ex-CIA police detective, or Jonathan Cold in ''[[The Foreigner (film)|The Foreigner]]'' and ''[[Black Dawn (film)|Black Dawn]]'', an ex-CIA Black Ops freelancer.) His characters differ from those of other action movie icons by virtue of their near-invulnerability; they almost never face any significant physical threat, easily overpowering any opposition and never facing bodily harm or even temporary defeat.<ref>{{cite book|title=Seagalogy: A Study of the Ass-Kicking Films of Steven Seagal.|last=Vern|publisher=Titan Books|year=2008|pages=12}}</ref> A notable exception is 2010's ''[[Machete (film)|Machete]]'', which features Seagal in a rare villainous role.

Seagal's films frequently reflect aspects of his personal life. His music appears in several of his films (for example, ''[[Into the Sun (2005 film)|Into The Sun]]'' and ''[[Ticker (2001 film)|Ticker]]'', where he appears as part of a bar band), as does his fluency in other languages (he speaks Japanese in ''[[Into the Sun (2005 film)|Into the Sun]]'') and religion ([[Buddhism]] features prominently in ''[[The Glimmer Man]]'' and ''[[Belly of the Beast]]''). His past as an aikido teacher is also incorporated into several films, for example ''[[Above the Law (film)|Above the Law]]'' (which opens with a montage of real-life photos from Seagal's own past) or ''[[Shadow Man (2006 film)|Shadow Man]]'', where he is seen giving an aikido demonstration. Several of his films also feature prominent political messages, most notably the [[environmentalism]] evident in ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', which ends with a lengthy speech in which Seagal (playing ex-CIA firefighter Forrest Taft) accuses big business of rampant environmental degradation:  
<blockquote>Big Business is primarily responsible for destroying the water we drink, the air we breathe and the food we eat. They have no care for the world they destroy, only for the money they make in the process... They basically control the legislation, and, in fact, they control the Law... They influence the media so that they can control our minds. They have made it a crime to speak out for ourselves, and if we do so we're called "conspiracy nuts" and we're laughed at... We have to force these companies to operate safely and responsibly, and with all our best interests in mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110725/quotes?item=qt0414808 |publisher=IMDB.com|title=IMDb quote page|accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref> </blockquote>In 2008, author and [[critic]] Vern (no last name) published ''[[Seagalogy]]'', a work which examines Seagal's filmography using the framework of [[auteur theory]]. The book divides Seagal's filmography into different chronological "eras" with distinct thematic elements. The book was updated in 2012 to include more recent films and Seagal's work on the [[reality TV]] show ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outlawvern.com/2012/03/27/seagalogy-updated-and-expanded-edition/ |title=Seagalogy: Updated and Expanded Edition « The Life and Art of Vern |publisher=Outlawvern.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>

===Music===
[[File:Steven Seagal 3.jpg|thumb|right|Seagal live in 2007]]
In addition to acting and [[aikido]], Seagal also plays the guitar, and his songs have been featured in several of his movies (such as ''Fire Down Below'' and ''Ticker''). In 2005, he released his first album, ''[[Songs from the Crystal Cave]]'', which has a mix of pop, [[world music|world]], [[country music|country]] and [[blues]] music. It features duets with [[Tony Rebel]], Lt. Stichie, [[Lady Saw]], and [[Stevie Wonder]]. The soundtrack to Seagal's 2005 film ''[[Into the Sun (2005 film)|Into the Sun]]'' features several songs from the album. One of his album tracks, "Girl It's Alright", was also released as a single in parts of the world alongside an accompanying music video created for it.

Seagal's second album, titled ''[[Mojo Priest]]'', was released in April 2006. Subsequently, he spent summer 2006 touring the United States and Europe with his band, Thunderbox, in support of the album.

===Law enforcement work===
Seagal is currently a [[Sheriffs in the United States|Reserve Deputy Chief]] in the [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]], Louisiana Sheriff's Office. Seagal owns a second home in Louisiana and spends several months a year there.<ref>{{cite news |last=Strauss |first=Gary |url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2009-12-02-seagal02_ST_N.htm |title='Lawman' finds Steven Seagal fighting crime for real |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2009-12-10 |newspaper=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> According to the show, Seagal graduated from a police academy in Los Angeles over twenty years ago and has a certificate from Peace Officer Standards & Training (POST), an organization that accredits California police officers. However, POST officials in California and Louisiana have no record of Seagal being certified, and Seagal's rank in Louisiana is ceremonial.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/02/entertainment/la-et-lawman2-2009dec02 |title=Steven Seagal gets to play cop |date=December 2, 2009 |first=Scott |last=Glover |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

In November 2008, [[A&E Network|A&E]] announced that they had begun taping ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman]]'', which follows his work in the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office. The series premiered on A&E on December 2, 2009. Seagal stated that "I’ve decided to work with A&E on this series now because I believe it’s important to show the nation all the positive work being accomplished here in Louisiana—to see the passion and commitment that comes from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office in this post-[[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] environment."

Shortly before the episodes were to be aired, the web and Facebook pages about the series were removed. A&E made no announcements about the sudden suspension of Season 3 or whether there would be a third season. 

It was announced on May 16, 2013, that the third season would air on [[Reelz]] starting in January 2014. Episodes from the first two seasons began airing on June 6, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lost Season of "Steven Seagal Lawman" to Air on Reelz|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2013/05/16/lost-season-of-steven-seagal-lawman-to-air-on-reelz-555505/20130516reelz01/|work=The Futon Critic|date=May 15, 2013}}</ref> Season 3 premiered on January 2, 2014.

===Business ventures===
In 1997, a company called [[Young Living|Young Living Essential Oils]] announced it was "working closely" with Seagal on a line of "therapeutic oil" products. The company claimed that Seagal had also allowed them to "use his Montana ranch as an additional site to grow [the] plants used to distill Young Living's Essential Oils..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/life_scents/oldfiles/seagal.html|title=Steven Seagal Health Line|publisher=[[Young Living]]|year=1997}}</ref> As of 2015, the company does not mention Seagal or any products co-created with him on its official website.

In February 1997, [[Lama]] [[Penor Rinpoche]] from [[Palyul]] monastery announced that Seagal was a [[tulku]], and specifically the [[reincarnation]] of [[Chungdrag Dorje]], a 17th-century [[terton]] (treasure revealer) of the [[Nyingma]], the oldest sect of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dorjeshugden.com/all-articles/features/the-peoples-princess-yabshi-pan-rinzinwangmo/ |title=The People's Princess Yabshi-Pan-Rinzinwangmo |publisher=DorjeShugden.com |date=30 January 2010}}</ref> Seagal's recognition aroused controversy in the [[Buddhism in the United States|American Buddhist community]], with [[Helen Tworkov]] commenting in ''[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|Tricycle]]'' to doubt the extent of Seagal's "spiritual wisdom" and to suggest that Seagal bought his [[Buddhahood]] by donations to Penor's [[Kunzang Palyul Choling]] center. Penor Rinpoche responded to the controversy by saying that Seagal, although acting in violent movies had not actually killed people, and that Seagal was merely ''recognized'', whereas ''enthronement'' as a tulku would require first a "lengthy process of study and practice".<ref>{{cite book|title=Virtual Tibet: Searching for Shangri-La from the Himalayas to Hollywood|first=Orville|last=Schell|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|year=2001|chapter=Tinseltown Tulkus|pages=73–74}}</ref>

===Relationships and family===
Seagal is married and has seven children from four relationships.

In Japan Seagal married his first wife, Miyako Fujitani, the daughter of an aikido instructor. With Fujitani, he had a son, model and actor Kentaro Seagal, and a daughter, writer and actress [[Ayako Fujitani]]. Seagal left Miyako Fujitani to go back to the United States.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eonline.com/On/Holly/Shows/Seagal/facts.html |title=E! TV- "E!

In the United States he married former ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' actress [[Adrienne La Russa]], despite his divorce to Fujitani not yet being finalized. During his marriage to La Russa, Seagal reportedly saw actress and model [[Kelly LeBrock]] in the 1984 [[Gene Wilder]] film ''[[The Woman in Red (1984 film)|Woman in Red]]'' and said that she was "his destiny".<ref name="LLC1993">{{cite book|title=Spy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DdQ9WL9ODdwC|accessdate=11 February 2013|date=1993-07 - 1993-08|publisher=Sussex Publishers, LLC|page=58-|issn=0890-1759}}</ref> He began a relationship with her and she eventually became pregnant with his child. When news of this emerged, Seagal's marriage to La Russa was annulled and he then married LeBrock on 5 September 1987. His three children with LeBrock are daughters Annaliza and Arissa, and son Dominic. In 1994, LeBrock filed divorce papers citing "irreconcilable differences". During this time it emerged that Seagal was having an affair with Arissa Wolf, the family's nanny.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lukeford.net/archives/updates/021118.htm|title=Spiritually Retreat With Steven Seagal|accessdate=2007-01-27|work=Luke Ford}}</ref> Seagal has a daughter with Arissa Wolf, Savannah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.lalate.com/2010/04/13/steven-seagal-wife-and-kelly-lebrock/ |title=Steven Seagal Wife and Kelly LeBrock! |publisher=News.lalate.com |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>
