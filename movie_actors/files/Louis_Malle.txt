'''Louis Marie Malle''' ({{IPA-fr|mal|lang}}; 30 October 1932 &ndash; 23 November 1995) was a French [[film director]], [[screenwriter]], and [[film producer|producer]]. His film, ''[[Le Monde du silence]]'', won the [[Palme d'Or]] and [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award for Best Documentary]] in 1956. He was also nominated multiple times for Academy Awards later in his career.

Malle worked in both [[French cinema]] and [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], and he produced both French and English language films. His most famous films include the crime film ''[[Ascenseur pour l'échafaud]]'' (1958), the WW II drama ''[[Lacombe Lucien]]'' (1974), the romantic crime film ''[[Atlantic City (1980 film)|Atlantic City]]'' (1980), the comedy-drama ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'' (1981), and the autobiographical WW II film ''[[Au revoir, les enfants]]'' (1987).

== Early years in France ==
Malle was born into a wealthy industrialist family in Thumeries, Nord, France, the son of Francoise (Béghin) and Pierre Malle.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=T6fyxWFrsNkC&pg=PA129&dq=Francoise+Beghin+Malle&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xobWVL-5Kc2oyATqkYHwBA&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ]</ref> He initially studied [[political science]] at the [[Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris|Sciences-Po]] before turning to [[film studies]] at [[La Fémis|IDHEC]] instead.

He worked as the co-director and cameraman to [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau|Jacques Cousteau]] on the [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Oscar]] and [[Palme d'Or]]-winning (at the 1956 [[Academy Awards]] and [[Cannes Film Festival]] respectively) documentary ''[[The Silent World]]'' (1956) and assisted [[Robert Bresson]] on ''[[A Man Escaped]]'' (French title: ''Un condamné à mort s'est échappé ou Le vent souffle où il veut'', 1956) before making his first feature, ''[[Elevator to the Gallows|Ascenseur pour l'échafaud]]'' (released in the U.K. as ''Lift to the Scaffold'' and in the U.S. originally as ''Frantic'', later as ''Elevator to the Gallows'') in 1957. A taut thriller featuring an original score by [[Miles Davis]], the film made an international film star of [[Jeanne Moreau]], at the time a leading stage actress of the state [[Comédie-Française]]. Malle was 24 years old.

Malle's ''[[The Lovers (1958 film)|The Lovers]]'' (''Les Amants'', 1958), which also starred Moreau, caused major controversy due to its sexual content, leading to a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case regarding the legal definition of obscenity. In ''[[Jacobellis v. Ohio]]'', a theater owner was fined $2,500 for obscenity. The decision was eventually reversed by the higher court, which found that the film was not obscene and hence constitutionally protected. However, the court could not agree on the definition of "obscene," which caused [[Potter Stewart|Justice Potter Stewart]] to utter his "[[I know it when I see it]]" opinion, perhaps the most famous single line associated with the court.

Malle is sometimes associated with the ''[[nouvelle vague]]'' - though his work does not directly fit in or correspond to the auteurist theories that apply to the work of [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]], [[François Truffaut|Truffaut]], [[Claude Chabrol|Chabrol]], [[Éric Rohmer|Rohmer]], and others, and he had nothing whatsoever to do with ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', he did exemplify many of the characteristics of the movement, including using natural light, and shooting on location. His film ''[[Zazie dans le metro (film)|Zazie dans le métro]]'' ("Zazie in the Metro," 1960, an adaptation of the [[Raymond Queneau]] novel) did inspire Truffaut to write an enthusiastic letter to Malle.

Other films also tackled taboo subjects: ''[[The Fire Within]]'' (''Le Feu follet'', 1963) centres on a man about to commit suicide, ''[[Le souffle au cœur|Murmur of the Heart]]'' (1971) deals with an [[incest]]uous relationship between mother and son and ''[[Lacombe Lucien]]'' (1974), co-written with [[Patrick Modiano]], is about collaboration with the [[Nazi]]s in [[Vichy]] France in [[World War II]]. The second film earned Malle his first (of three) [[Academy Award]] nominations for "Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced."

==Documentary on India==

In 1968 Malle visited India and made a seven part documentary series ''[[Phantom India|L'Inde fantôme: Reflexions sur un voyage]]'' and a [[documentary film]] ''[[Calcutta (1969 film)|Calcutta]]'', which was released in cinemas.<ref name="indmalle01">[http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/dvd/07/45/louis-malle-documentaries.html Peter Hourigan: The Documentaries of Louis Malle Criterion box set]: Review at Senses of Cinema: March 2009</ref> Concentrating on real India, its rituals and festivities, Malle fell afoul of the [[government of India|Indian government]], which disliked his portrayal of the country, in its fascination with the pre-modern, and consequently banned the BBC from filming in India for several years.<ref name="malleind02">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/storyville/louis-malles-india.shtml BBC Storyville] - Nick Fraser 2002</ref> Malle later claimed his documentary on India was his favorite film<ref name="malleind02"/>

==Move to America==

Malle later moved to the United States and continued to direct there. His later films include ''[[Pretty Baby (1978 film)|Pretty Baby]]'' (1978), ''[[Atlantic City (1980 film)|Atlantic City]]'' (1981), ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'' (1981), ''[[Crackers (1984 film)|Crackers]]'' (1984), ''[[Alamo Bay]]'' (1985), ''[[Damage (1992 film)|Damage]]'' (1992) and ''[[Vanya on 42nd Street]]'' (1994, an adaptation of [[Anton Chekhov]]'s play ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'') in English; ''[[Au revoir, les enfants]]'' (1987) and ''[[Milou en Mai]]'' (''May Fools'' in the U.S., 1990) in French. Just as his earlier films such as ''The Lovers'' helped popularize French films in the United States, ''My Dinner with Andre'' was at the forefront of the rise of American independent cinema in the 1980s.

== Personal life ==
Malle was married to Anne-Marie Deschodt from 1965 to 1967.  He had a son, Manuel Cuotemoc (born 1971), with German actress [[Gila von Weitershausen]] and a daughter Justine (born 1974) with Canadian-born French actress [[Alexandra Stewart]].

He married actress [[Candice Bergen]] in 1980.  They had one child, a daughter, Chloe Francoise Malle, on November 8, 1985.

He died from [[lymphoma]] at their home in [[Beverly Hills, California]], at 63 on [[Thanksgiving Day]] November 23, 1995.
