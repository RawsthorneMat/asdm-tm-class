'''Joseph Walton Losey''' (January 14, 1909 – June 22, 1984) was an [[United States|American]] theatre and [[film director]], born in [[Wisconsin]]. After studying in [[Germany]] with [[Bertolt Brecht]], Losey returned to the [[United States]], eventually making his way to [[Hollywood]]. In the 1950s Losey was [[blacklisted]] in the [[United States]] and moved to Europe where he made the remainder of his films, mostly in the [[United Kingdom]]. He died at his home in London on June 22, 1984 aged 75.

== Early life and career ==
Joseph Losey was born on January 14, 1909 in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]],<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news|last=Apple, Jr.|first=R.W.|title=Joseph Losey, Film Director Blacklisted in 1950's, Dies at 75|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/23/obituaries/joseph-losey-film-director-blacklisted-in-1950-s-dies-at-75.html|accessdate=April 3, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 23, 1984}}</ref> where he was a friend of [[Nicholas Ray]] in high school.<ref name=brody>{{cite news|last=Brody|first=Richard|title=DVD of the Week: Joseph Losey’s "Mr. Klein"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/movies/2012/11/dvd-of-the-week-mr-klein.html|accessdate=April 4, 2013|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> He attended [[Dartmouth College]] and [[Harvard University]], beginning as a student of medicine and ending in drama.<ref name=archer>{{cite news|last=Archer|first=Eugene|title=Expatriate Retraces his Steps|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30A12F8395415738DDDAC0994DB405B848AF1D3|accessdate=April 3, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 15, 1964}}</ref>

Losey became a major figure in [[New York City|New York]] political theatre, first directing the controversial failure ''Little Old Boy'' in 1933.<ref>{{IBDB title|id=5475|title=Little Ol' Boy}}</ref> He declined to direct a staged version of ''[[Dodsworth (novel)|Dodsworth]]'' by [[Sinclair Lewis]], which led Lewis to offer him his first work written for the stage, ''Jayhawker''. Losey directed the show, which had a brief run.<ref name=archer/> [[Bosley Crowther]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted that "The play, being increasingly wordy, presents staging problems that Joe Losey's direction does not always solve. It is hard to tell who is responsible for the obscure parts in the story."<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|title=Fred Stone as a Civil War Senator...|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0D14FE385B107A93C4A9178AD95F408385F9|accessdate=April 3, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 6, 1934}}</ref>

In 1935 he visited the [[Soviet Union]] for several months to study the Russian stage. He either accompanied or was accompanied by [[Elizabeth Hawes]], who staged a show of her fashions in [[Moscow]].<ref name=ray/>

In 1936 he directed ''Triple A Plowed Under'' on Broadway, a production of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]'s [[Federal Theatre Project]].<ref name=ray>{{cite book|last=McGilligan|first=Patrick|title=Nicholas Ray: The Glorious Failure of an American Director|year=2011 |publisher=HarperCollins|location=NY|pages=64–5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s-0g_LtOTbUC&pg=PA65&}}</ref> He then directed the second [[Living Newspaper]] presentation, ''Injunction Granted''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Atkinson |first=Brooks |date=July 25, 1936 |title=The Play: WPA Journalism |url= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location= |accessdate= }}</ref>

Losey married Hawes on July 24, 1937.<ref>{{cite news|title=Elizabeth Jester Wed|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50C10FA3D59177A93C6AB178CD85F438385F9 |accessdate=March 31, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=July 24, 1937}}</ref> They had a son, [[Gavrik Losey]], in 1938, but divorced in November 1944.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berch|first=Bettina |title=Radical by Design: The Life and Style of Elizabeth Hawes|year=1988|publisher=Dutton|location=NY|page=103}}</ref>

He arrived in Hollywood just after the [[Second World War]]. His first film, in 1947, was a political allegory ''[[The Boy with Green Hair]]'', starring a young [[Dean Stockwell]] as Peter, a war orphan who is subject to ridicule after he awakens one morning to find his hair mysteriously turned green.

That same year he returned to Broadway and staged the first [[English language]] version of Bertolt Brecht's ''[[Galileo (play)|Galileo]]'' starring [[Charles Laughton]], with music by [[Hanns Eisler]].<ref>{{IBDB title|id=1806|title=Galileo}}, December 7–14, 1947</ref> Of the extravagant production with 66 roles, [[Brooks Atkinson]] wrote: "As produced under Joseph Losey's direction, Mr. Brecht's play diffuses the legend of Galileo across the stage, and values showmanship above the drama."<ref>{{cite news|last=Atkinson|first=Brooks|title=Charles Laughton Opens Experimental Theater Season in Brecht's 'Galileo'|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60916F73A5F1A7A93CAA91789D95F438485F9|accessdate=April 3, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 8, 1947}}</ref> Participants reported that Laughton and Brecht controlled the performance, leaving little for Losey in the role of director.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fuegi|first=John|title=Brecht and Company: Sex, Politics, and the Making of the Modern Drama|year=1994|publisher=Grove Press|location=NY |page=474 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PlTmCuj4K8AC&pg=PA474&}}</ref>

In 1951 the producer of [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1931 classic ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' (Seymour Nebenzal) hired Losey to direct a remake of the film set in Los Angeles instead of Germany. The killer's name in the film was changed from Hans Beckert to Martin W. Harrow. Nebenzal's son Harold was associate producer of the 1951 version.

==Politics and exile==
The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) was interested in Losey because in the 1930s and 40s he had extensive contacts with people on the political left, including radicals and Communists or people who subsequently become such.  He had a long association with [[Hanns Eisler]], long a target of HUAC's interest.<ref name=gardner/>  Losey wrote to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] in support of a resident's visa for the composer, who had many radical associations. They collaborated on a "political cabaret" from 1937 to 1939. Losey invited him to compose music for a short public relations film he had been commissioned to direct for presentation at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], ''Petre Oleum and His Cousins'', which launched Eisler's career in film music.<ref>{{cite book|last=Palmier|first=Jean-Michel|title=Weimar in Exile: The Antifascist Emigration In Europe And America |year=2006 |publisher=Verso |location=NY |pages=532, 802n131 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2UPrsyu3znkC&pg=PA532&}}</ref>

Losey had also worked on the [[Federal Theatre Project]], long a target of HUAC. ''Triple-A Plowed Under'', on which Losey had worked, had been denounced by HUAC's antecedent, the [[Dies Committee]] as Communist propaganda.<ref name=gardner/> His Hollywood collaborators included a long list of other HUAC targets, including [[Dalton Trumbo]] and [[Ring Lardner]].<ref name=gardner/>

Losey's first wife [[Elizabeth Hawes]] worked with wide range of Communists and anti-Communist liberals at the radical newspaper ''[[PM (newspaper)|PM]]'' during their marriage. After it ended in 1944, she wrote about working as a union organizer just after World War II, where "one preferred the Communists to the Red-Baiters".<ref>{{cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Daniel|title=Betty Friedan and the Making of the Feminine Mystique: The American Left, the Cold War and Modern Feminism |year=1998 |pages=129 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=szJCHwWNwp8C&pg=PA129&}}</ref> At some point, probably early in the 1940s, the FBI was maintaining dossiers on both Losey and Hawes. His included charges that he was a [[Stalin]]ist agent as of 1945.<ref name=gardner/>

In 1946 Losey joined the [[Communist Party]]. He later explained to a French interviewer:<ref name=gardner/>
{{quote|I had a feeling that I was being useless in Hollywood, that I'd been cut off from New York activity and I felt that my existence was unjustified. It was a kind of Hollywood guilt that led me into that kind of commitment. And I think that the work that I did on a much freer, more personal and independent basis for the political left in New York, before going to Hollywood, was much more valuable socially.}}

Losey had a long-term contract with [[Dore Schary]] at [[RKO]] when [[Howard Hughes]] purchased the company in 1948 and began purging it of leftists. Losey later explained how Hughes tested employees to determine if they had Communist sympathies:<ref>{{cite book|last=Milne, ed.|first=Tom|title=Losey on Losey|year=1968|publisher=[[Doubleday & Company]]|location=Garden City, NY|page=73}}</ref>  
{{quote|I was offered a film called "I Married a Communist," which I turned down categorically. I later learned that it was a touchstone for establishing who was a "red": you offered "I Married a Communist" to anybody you thought was a Communist, and if they turned it down, they were.}}
Hughes responded by holding Losey to his contract without assigning him any work.<ref name=gardner>{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Colin |title=Joseph Losey|year=2004|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|pages=8–11 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2dekMDmBz5oC&pg=PA8&}}</ref> In mid-1949, Schary persuaded Hughes to release Losey, who soon began working as an independent on ''The Lawless'' for [[Paramount Pictures]].<ref name=gardner/> Soon he was working on a three-picture contract with [[Stanley Kramer]]. Then his name was mentioned by two witnesses before HUAC in the spring of 1951. Losey's attorney suggested arranging a deal with the committee for testimony in secret. Instead Losey abandoned his work editing ''[[The Big Night]]''<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoberman|first=J.|title=An Army of Phantoms: American Movies and the Making of the Cold War|year=2011|publisher=[[New Press]]|location=NY|page=174}}</ref> and left for Europe with his wife Louise a few days later, while HUAC took weeks to try unsuccessfully to serve him with a subpoena compelling his testimony.<ref name=gardner/>

After more than a year working on ''Stranger on the Prowl'' in [[Italy]], Losey returned to the US on October 12, 1952. He found himself unemployable:<ref name=gardner/>
{{quote|I was [in the United States] for about a month and there was no work in theatre, no work in radio, no work in education or advertising, and none in films, in anything. For one brief moment, I was going to do the [[Arthur Miller]] play, ''[[The Crucible]]''. Then they got scared because I had been named. So after a month of finding that there was no possible way in which I could make a living in this country, I left. I didn't come back for twelve years.... I didn't stay away for reasons of fear, it was just that I didn't have any money. I didn't have any work.}}
He returned briefly to [[Rome]] and settled in [[London]] on January 4, 1953.<ref name=gardner/>

==Career in Europe==
He settled in [[UK|Britain]] and there he developed a cult following for genre films that ranged from the [[British Regency|Regency]] melodrama ''[[The Gypsy and the Gentleman]]'' (1958) to the gangster film''[[The Criminal]]'' (1960).<ref name=french>{{cite news|last=French|first=Philip|title=Blacklisted but unbowed|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/may/24/joseph-losey-film-director|accessdate=April 3, 2013|newspaper=Guardian (UK)|date=May 23, 2009}}</ref>

He was credited for his work as director on his first British film, ''[[The Sleeping Tiger]]'', a 1954 [[film noir]] crime thriller, under the pseudonym Victor Hanbury, because the stars of the film, [[Alexis Smith]] and [[Alexander Knox]], feared being blacklisted by [[Hollywood]] in turn if it became known they had worked with him. ''The Intimate Stranger'' (1956) carried a pseudonym as well.<ref name=archer/>

Losey was also originally slated to direct the 1956 [[Hammer Films]] production ''[[X the Unknown]]'', but after a few days' work the star [[Dean Jagger]] refused to work with a supposed [[Communist]] sympathiser and Losey was removed from the project.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Losey was later hired by Hammer Films to direct ''[[The Damned (1963 film)|The Damned]]'', a 1963 British science fiction film based on H.L. Lawrence's novel "The Children of Light".

In the 1960s, Losey began working with playwright [[Harold Pinter]], in what became a long friendship and a successful screenwriting career for Pinter. Losey directed three films based on Pinter's screenplays: ''[[The Servant (1963 film)|The Servant]]'' (1963), ''[[Accident (1967 film)|Accident]]'' (1967) and ''[[The Go-Between (film)|The Go-Between]]'' (1971). ''The Servant'' won three [[British Academy Film Awards]]. ''Accident'' won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury award at the 1967 [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Accident|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2777/year/1967.html|work=Festival Archives|publisher=Festival de Cannes|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}</ref> ''The Go-Between'' won the [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm Award]] at the 1971 [[Cannes Film Festival]], four prizes at the 1972 [[BAFTA]] awards, and 'Best British Screenplay' at the 1972 [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] awards.<ref>"IMDb: Awards for The Go-Between" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067144/awards</ref> Each of the three films examines the politics of sexuality, gender and class in 1960s and 1970s Britain. In ''The Servant'', a manservant facilitates the moral and psychological degradation of his privileged and rich employer. ''Accident'' explores male lust, hypocrisy and ennui among the educated middle class as two Oxford tutors competitively objectify a student against the backdrop of their seemingly idyllic lives. In ''[[The Go-Between]]'', a young middle class boy, the summer guest of an upper-class family, becomes the messenger for an affair between the daughter of his hosts and a working class farmer.

Although Losey's films are generally naturalistic, ''The Servant's'' hybridisation of Losey's signature [[Baroque]] style, [[film noir]], [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] and [[expressionism]] and both ''Accident's'' and ''The Go-Between's'' radical [[cinematography]], use of [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]], [[voice over]] and [[Film score|musical score]] amount to a sophisticated construction of cinematic [[time]] and [[narrative]] perspective that edges this work in the direction of neorealist cinema. All three films are marked by Pinter's sparse, elliptical and enigmatically subtextual dialogue, something Losey often develops a visual correlate for (and occasionally even works against) by means of dense and cluttered mise en scene and peripatetic camera work.

In 1966 Losey directed ''Modesty Blaise'', a comedy spy-fi film produced in the United Kingdom and released worldwide in 1966. Sometimes considered a James Bond [[parody|sendup]], this was loosely based on the popular comic strip ''[[Modesty Blaise]]'' by Peter O'Donnell.

Losey also worked with Pinter on ''The Proust Screenplay'' (1972), an adaptation of ''[[A la recherche du temps perdu]]'' by [[Marcel Proust]]. Losey died before the project's financing could be assembled.

In 1975 Losey realized a long-planned film adaptation of Brecht's ''Galileo'' released as ''[[Life of Galileo]]'' starring [[Chaim Topol|Topol]]. ''Galileo'' was produced as part of the subscription film series of the [[American Film Theatre]], though it was shot in the UK. In the context of that production, Losey also made a half-hour film based on [[Galileo]]'s life.

Losey's ''[[Monsieur Klein]]'' (1976) examined the day in Occupied France when Jews in and around [[Paris]] were arrested for deportation. He said he so completely rejected naturalism in film that in this case he divided his shooting schedule into three "visual categories": Unreality, Reality and Abstract.<ref name=brody/>

In 1979 Losey filmed Mozart's opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', shot in [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"|Villa La Rotonda]] and the [[Veneto]] region of Italy: this [[Don Giovanni (1979 film)|film]] was nominated for several [[César Awards]] in 1980 including Best Director. He demonstrated a facility for working in the [[French language]] and ''[[Monsieur Klein]]'' (1976) gave [[Alain Delon]] as star and producer one of French cinema's earliest chances to highlight the background to the infamous [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]] of French Jews in July 1942.

==Personal life==
In 1964 Losey told the ''[[New York Times]]'': "I'd love to work in America again, but it would have to be just the right thing."<ref name=archer/> He told an interviewer the year before he died that he was not bitter about being blacklisted: "Without it I would have three Cadillacs, two swimming pools and millions of dollars, and I'd be dead. It was terrifying, it was disgusting, but you can get trapped by money and complacency. A good shaking up never did anyone any harm."<ref name=nytobit/>

Dartmouth College, his alma mater, awarded Losey an honorary degree in 1973.<ref name=nytobit/> In 1983, the [[University of Wisconsin]] at Madison did the same.<ref name=nytobit/>

Losey married three times and divorced twice. He had a son, [[Gavrik Losey]], with the fashion designer, author and feminist [[Elizabeth Hawes]]. Gavrik helped out with the production on some of his father's films. Gavrik's two sons are film directors [[Marek Losey]] and [[Luke Losey]]. From 1956 to 1963 Losey was married to British actress [[Dorothy Bromiley]]. On July 16, 1957 they had a son, Joshua Losey, who has become an actor. Losey then married the former Patricia Mohan, who adapted [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]]'s opera libretto for Losey's ''Don Giovanni'' and [[Steaming (play)|Nell Dunn's play]] for ''[[Steaming (1985 film)|Steaming]]''.

He died at his home in London on June 22, 1984 following a brief illness, just four weeks after completing his last film.<ref name=nytobit/>
