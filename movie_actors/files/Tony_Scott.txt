He was the younger brother of film director [[Ridley Scott]]. In November 2010, Tony (and Ridley) Scott received the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] [[Britannia Awards|Britannia Award]] for Worldwide Contribution to Filmed Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Sullivan |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118024291?refCatId=13 |title=BAFTA/LA to honor Scott Free Prods. |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Elsevier Inc.|date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> Tony Scott died on 19 August 2012, committing [[suicide]] by jumping off the [[Vincent Thomas Bridge]] in [[San Pedro, California]].<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2221702/Tony-Scott-autopsy-reveals-taken-anti-depressants-sleeping-pills--confirms-director-WASNT-suffering-cancer.html "Tony Scott had taken anti-depressants and sleeping pills before he jumped off bridge to his death as autopsy confirms director WASN'T suffering from cancer"].

At the age of 16, he appeared in ''[[Boy and Bicycle]]'', a short film marking the directorial debut of his 23-year-old brother [[Ridley Scott|Ridley]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9486824/Tony-Scott.html |title=Tony Scott |work=The Telegraph |date= 20 August 2012|accessdate=20 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

Scott studied art in [[Leeds]] after failing to gain admission to the [[Royal College of Art]] in London at his first attempt. He made a short film in 1969 based on the [[Ambrose Bierce]] story ''One of the Missing''. As Ridley had previously cast him in a film, he reciprocated by giving his brother a role too. "The film cost £1,000", he recalled in April 2012. Whilst at the [[Royal College of Art]], he starred in "Don't Walk", a film by fellow students, Hank Onrust and Richard Stanley: the film credits state it was "made for [[BUNAC]] by MARCA films at the Royal College of Art". He graduated from the [[Royal College of Art]], following in the footsteps of his elder brother Ridley, with the intention of becoming a painter.<ref name="Galloway">{{cite news|last=Galloway|first=Stephen|title=Tony Scott's Unpublished Interview: 'My Family Is Everything to Me'| url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tony-scott-death-ridley-scott-interview-364528|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=25 August 2012|date=22 August 2012}}</ref> His eldest brother Frank had earlier joined the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]].

==Film career==

===Commercials===
It was the success of his elder brother's fledgling television commercial production outfit, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), that subsequently diverted his attention to film. His brother Ridley said, "Tony had wanted to do documentaries at first. I told him, 'Don't go to the BBC, come to me first.' I knew that he had a fondness for cars, so I told him, 'Come work with me and within a year you'll have a Ferrari.' And he did!"<ref>Ridley Scott's comment on The Directors—The Films of Ridley Scott.</ref> Scott said, "I was finishing eight years at art school, and Ridley had opened Ridley Scott Associates and said, 'Come and make commercials and make some money' because I owed money left and right and centre."<ref name="Galloway"/> He directed many television commercials for RSA while also overseeing the company's operation while his brother was developing his feature film career. "My goal was to make films but I got sidetracked into commercials and then I took off. I had 15 years [making them], and it was a blast. We were very prolific, and that was our training ground: You'd shoot 100 days in a year, then we gravitated from that to film," he said.<ref name="Galloway"/>

Scott took time out in 1975 to direct a television adaptation of the [[Henry James]] story ''[[The Author of Beltraffio]]''.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/20/tony-scott?newsfeed=true Tony Scott obituary]. ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 21 August 2012</ref> After the feature film successes of fellow British directors [[Hugh Hudson]], [[Alan Parker]], [[Adrian Lyne]] and his elder brother during the late 1970s, all of whom had graduated from directing advertising commercials, he received initial overtures from Hollywood in 1980. His eldest brother Frank died, aged 45, of skin cancer during the same year.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/hollywood-pays-tribute-to-top-gun-director-tony-scott-following-suicide-leap-8062363.html | title= Hollywood pays tribute to Top Gun director Tony Scott following suicide leap | first1= Tom | last1= Harper |first2= Louise | last2= Jury | date= 20 August 2012 | newspaper= [[Evening Standard]] | accessdate= 5 September 2012 }}</ref>

===Early films===
Scott reflected on his career in 2009:<ref name="RichInterview">{{cite web|last=Rich|first=Katey|title=Interview: Tony Scott|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Tony-Scott-13537.html|work=Cinema Blend|accessdate=20 August 2012|date=12 June 2009}}</ref>
{{Quotation|The '80s was a whole era. We were criticised, we being the Brits coming over, because we were out of advertising—[[Alan Parker]], [[Hugh Hudson]], [[Adrian Lyne]], my brother—we were criticised about style over content. [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] was very bored of the way American films were very traditional and classically done. Jerry was always looking for difference. That's why I did six movies with Jerry. He always applauded the way I wanted to approach things. That period in the '80s was a period when I was constantly being criticised, and my press was horrible. I never read any press after ''The Hunger''.}}
Scott persisted in trying to embark on a feature film career. Among the ideas interesting to him was an adaptation of the [[Anne Rice]] novel ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' then in development.<ref name=empiremag>{{cite news|last=White|first=James|title=Tony Scott Dies|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=34930|accessdate=24 August 2012|newspaper=Empire|date=20 August 2012}}</ref> [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] was already developing the vampire film ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'', for which they brought Scott on in 1982. ''The Hunger'' starred [[David Bowie]] and [[Catherine Deneuve]] and introduced [[Willem Dafoe]] in a small role. ''The Hunger'' had elaborate photography and sumptuous production design, but it failed to find an audience or impress the critics, and had disappointing box office sales<ref name=LAT208 /><ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/20/tony-scott "Tony Scott Obituary"].

In 1985, producers [[Don Simpson]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] approached Scott to direct ''[[Top Gun]]'' on the strength of ''The Hunger'', as well as a commercial he had done for [[Sweden|Swedish]] automaker [[Saab automobile|Saab]] in the early 1980s, where a [[Saab 900]] turbo is shown racing a [[Saab 37 Viggen]] fighter jet. Scott, though reluctant at first, agreed to direct ''Top Gun''. Though the film received mixed critical review, it became one of the highest-grossing films of 1986, taking in more than US$176&nbsp;million,<ref name=LAT208 /> and making a star of its young lead, [[Tom Cruise]].<ref name=bbcobit>{{cite news|title=Obituary: Tony Scott| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19316140|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 August 2012}}</ref>

===Hollywood success===
Following the success of  ''[[Top Gun]]'', Scott found himself on Hollywood's A-list of action directors.<ref name=bbcobit /> He re-teamed with Simpson and Bruckheimer in 1987 to direct [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Brigitte Nielsen]] in the highly anticipated sequel ''[[Beverly Hills Cop II]]''. While not being critically embraced, the film nevertheless became one of the year's highest grossers.<ref name=LAT208 /> His next film, ''[[Revenge (1990 film)|Revenge]]'' (1990), a thriller of adultery and revenge set in [[Mexico]], starred [[Kevin Costner]], [[Madeleine Stowe]] and [[Anthony Quinn]]. Once again directing Tom Cruise, Scott returned to the Simpson-Bruckheimer fold to helm the big-budget racing film ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' (1990). Scott later stated that it was difficult to find the drama in racing cars in circles, so he "stole from all race movies to date ... then tried to build on them."<ref name=WP198>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/authorities-say-top-gun-director-tony-scott-dies-after-jumping-off-los-angeles-county-bridge/2012/08/20/9e5572da-ea7d-11e1-866f-60a00f604425_story.html |title=Authorities say 'Top Gun' director Tony Scott dies after jumping off Los Angeles County bridge |agency=Associated Press|date=19 August 2012 |work=The Washington Post |archivedate=20 August 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6A3Oe4mC5 |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref> Scott's next film was the cult action thriller ''[[The Last Boy Scout]]'' (1991) starring [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Damon Wayans]] and written by [[Shane Black]].

In 1993, Scott directed ''[[True Romance]]'' costing just $13m, from a script by [[Quentin Tarantino]].<ref name=guardianclips>{{cite news|last=Shoard|first=Catherine|title=Tony Scott: a career in clips|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/20/tony-scott-career-clips|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 August 2012|location=London}}</ref> The cast included [[Christian Slater]], [[Patricia Arquette]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Tom Sizemore]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Val Kilmer]] and in bit roles, [[James Gandolfini]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Although it received positive reviews from [[Janet Maslin]] and other critics, it took less than $13m and was considered a box office failure.<ref name=LAT208 /> Scott's next film, ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'' (1995), was a submarine thriller starring [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Denzel Washington]]. His follow-up film, 1996's ''[[The Fan (1996 film)|The Fan]]'', starred [[Robert De Niro]], [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Ellen Barkin]] and [[Benicio del Toro]]. Scott's 1998 film ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]'', a conspiracy thriller, starred [[Will Smith]] and Gene Hackman, and was his highest-grossing film of the decade.<ref name=LAT208 /> His next film, ''[[Spy Game]]'', was released in November 2001. It garnered 63% positive reviews at [[Metacritic]] and made a little over $60m at the US box office. Scott subsequently directed another thriller starring Denzel Washington, ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]]'', released in April 2004.

Scott and his brother Ridley were co-producers of the TV series ''[[Numb3rs]]'',<ref name=WP198/> which aired from 2005 to 2010.

===Unreleased projects===
Scott developed a film adaptation of [[Clifford Irving]]'s novel ''Tom Mix and Pancho Villa'' (1981) for over a decade. In November 2003, he scouted locations in Mexico, and [[Steven Zaillian]] was writing the screenplay. "This is ''[[Lawrence of Arabia]]'' meets ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'', a huge film with trains, cavalry, thousands of soldiers in uniform and on horseback," Scott said.<ref>{{cite news| last1= Fleming| first1=Michael|last2=Bensinger|first2=Ken|title='Pancho' in Mexico mix|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117895873| work= [[Variety (newspaper)|Variety]] |accessdate=25 August 2012|date=17 November 2003}}</ref>

In late 2006, Scott announced a remake of the [[action thriller]] ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'' (1979). "The original ''Warriors'' was New York in the 1970s, and everything went upwards, everything went vertically. And now I'm making it a contemporary thing and doing it in L.A., so everything is horizontal. So my vision of ''The Warriors'' is Los Angeles in 2007 and the gangs, instead of being 30, are going to be 3,000 or 5,000," he said.<ref name="WarriorsRemake">{{cite web|last=Collura|first=Scott|title=Helmer Talks Warriors Remake|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/16/helmer-talks-warriors-remake|work=IGN|accessdate=25 August 2012|date=16 November 2006}}</ref> Scott met with actual gang members for research: "I've met all the heads of all the different gangs, so I've already educated myself.

==Directing style==
Katey Rich of Cinema Blend wrote that Scott had a "trademark frenetic camera style",<ref>{{cite web| last= Rich| first= Katey| title= Remembering Tony Scott, In His Own Words|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Remembering-Tony-Scott-His-Own-Words-32561.html| work= Cinema Blend|accessdate=20 August 2012|date=20 August 2012}}</ref> which Scott spoke about in June 2009, in reference to ''[[The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009 film)|The Taking of Pelham 123]]'':
{{Quote|It's about energy and it's about momentum, and I think the movie's very exciting, and it's not one individual thing. The true excitement comes from the actors—that gives you the true drama—and whatever I can do with the camera, that's icing on the cake. I wanted the movie to grab you. I use four cameras and I maybe do three takes—so the actors love it. Maybe I move it more than I should, but that's the nature of the way I am.<ref name="RichInterview"/> }}

Scott also spoke about his career in general:
{{Quote|What always leads me in terms of my movies are characters. [I tell my production team] 'Go into the real world, cast these people in the real world, and find me role models for my writers.' Then I reverse-engineer. I don't change the structure of the script, but I use my research. That's always been my mantra, and that's what gets me excited, because I get to educate and entertain myself in terms of worlds I could never normally touch, other than the fact that I'm a director. [...] If you look at my body of work, there's always a dark side to my characters. They've always got a skeleton in the closet, they've always got a subtext. I like that. Whether it's Bruce Willis in ''Last Boy Scout'' or Denzel Washington in ''The Taking of Pelham 123''. I think fear, and there's two ways of looking at fear. The most frightening thing I do in my life is getting up and shooting movies. Commercials, movies, every morning I'm bolt upright on one hour two hours sleep, before the alarm clock goes off. That's a good thing. That fear motivates me, and I enjoy that fear. I'm perverse in that way. I do other things. I've rock climbed all my life. Whenever I finish a movie, I do multi-day ascents, I go hang on a wall in [[Yosemite]]. That fear is tangible. That's black and white. I can make this hold or that hold. The other fear is intangible, it's very abstract, and that's more frightening.<ref name="RichInterview"/> }}

Manohla Dargis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Scott was "one of the most influential film directors of the past 25 years, if also one of the most consistently and egregiously underloved by critics" and called him "[o]ne of the pop futurists of the contemporary [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]".<ref name="Dargis">{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=A Director Who Excelled in Excess|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/movies/tony-scott-made-movies-as-a-maximalist.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=25 August 2012|date=20 August 2012}}</ref> She felt that "[t]here was plenty about his work that was problematic and at times offensive, yet it could have terrific pop, vigour, beauty and a near [[Cinéma pur|pure cinema]] quality. These were, more than anything, films by someone who wanted to pull you in hard and never let you go."<ref name="Dargis"/> Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' wrote that "the propulsive, at times borderline preposterous popcorn-thriller storylines; the slice-and-dice editing and the images that somehow managed to glow with grit; the fireball violence, often glimpsed in smeary-techno telephoto shots; the way he had of making actors seem volatile and dynamic and, at the same time, lacking almost any subtext" were qualities of Scott's films that both "excited audiences about his work" and "kept him locked outside the gates of critical respectability."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|title=Was Tony Scott a good director?

Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that after ''Top Gun'', Scott "found his commercial niche as a brash, flashy, sometimes vulgar action painter on celluloid", citing ''Beverly Hills Cop II'', ''Days of Thunder'', ''The Last Boy Scout'', ''True Romance'', and ''The Fan'' as examples.<ref name="McCarthy">{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|title=Todd McCarthy: How Tony Scott Finally Won Me Over|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tony-scott-death-todd-mccarthy-364549|work=The Hollywood Reporter| accessdate=25 August 2012|date=22 August 2012}}</ref> McCarthy concluded that ''Unstoppable'', Scott's final film, was one of his best: Apart from having "its director's fingerprints all over it: the commitment to extreme action, frenetic cutting, stripped-down dialogue", McCarthy found "a social critique embedded in its guts; it was about disconnected working class stiffs living marginal lives on society's sidings, about the barely submerged anger of a neglected underclass", something which "always had been lacking from Tony Scott's work, some connection to the real world rather than just silly flyboy stuff and meaningful glances accompanied by this year's pop music hit."<ref name="McCarthy"/>  Betsy Sharkey of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that Denzel Washington—who starred in ''Crimson Tide'', ''Man on Fire'', ''Déjà Vu'', ''The Taking of Pelham 123'', and ''Unstoppable''—was Scott's [[Wiktionary:muse#English|muse]], and Scott "was at his best when Washington was in the picture. The characters the actor played are the archetype of the kind of men Scott made. At their core, and what guided all the actions that followed, was a fundamental decency. They were flawed men to be sure, some more than others, but men who accorded dignity to anyone who deserved it."<ref>{{cite news| last= Sharkey| first= Betsy|title=Tony Scott, a man of action who brought out the best in his men|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-tony-scott-a-man-of-action-20120824,0,5630934.story|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=25 August 2012| date=24 August 2012}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Scott married three times. His first marriage was to [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA Award]] winning TV production designer [[Gerry Scott|Gerry Boldy]] (1944–2007) in 1967. They were divorced in 1974.<ref name=gerryscott>{{cite news|last=Stafford-Clark|first=Nigel|title=Obituary: Gerry Scott Foulds| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/may/12/broadcasting.guardianobituaries|accessdate=27 August 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=12 May 2007|location=London}}</ref> His second marriage was in 1986 to advertising executive Glynis Sanders.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hough |first=Andrew |last2=Allen |first2=Nick |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9486673/Top-Gun-director-Tony-Scott-dies-after-jumping-from-Los-Angeles-bridge.html |title=Top Gun director Tony Scott dies after jumping from Los Angeles bridge |work=The Telegraph |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2012 |location=London}}</ref> They divorced a year later when his affair with [[Brigitte Nielsen]], whom he met on the set of ''Beverly Hills Cop II'', became public. She was married to [[Sylvester Stallone]] at the time. He subsequently met film and TV actress Donna Wilson, who was 24 years younger, on the set of ''Days of Thunder'' in 1990; they married in 1994.
