In February 2013, the Weinstein Company has confirmed to have purchased the rights of a [[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon#Sequel|Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon sequel]] and is contacting Yen to play the male lead. In March 2013, Hong Kong magazines surfaced photos of [[Harvey Weinstein]] and [[Bob Weinstein]] travelling to Hong Kong specially to meet up with Donnie Yen to persuade him to accept the offer. It was reported that Yen is considering the role and is quoted as saying “The first is that my schedule this year is very packed. The second is that the first film is already such a classic. I am afraid of the pressure, that the original cannot be surpassed.”<ref>{{cite web|author=Channel News Asia|url=http://www.donnieyen.asia/?p=881&lang=en |title= Donnie Yen mulls lead role in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" sequel |publisher=Donnie Yen Asia |date=12 Mar 2013 |accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>

Yen describes himself as a mixed martial artist.<ref name="nytimes1"/> He learned [[Tai Chi]] from a young age, under his mother's tutelage. He then wanted to learn [[taekwondo]] in his teenage years, earning a 6th Dan in the process. At the time, the Beijing wushu team had a scout in the United States, and invited Yen over to Beijing, China, where he began training at the Beijing Sports Institute, the same facility where champion-turned actor [[Jet Li]] trained; this is where the two of them crossed paths for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|last=Valentin |first=Albert |url=http://martialconnection.blogspot.com/2010/09/faces-donnie-yen.html |title=FACES: DONNIE YEN &#124; Martial Connect |publisher=Martialconnection.blogspot.com |date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref>

Upon his return back to the [[United States]], he won gold medals in various wushu competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goldsea.com/Text/index.php?id=6452 |title=Donnie Yen: The Next Martial Arts Icon |publisher= Goldsea Asian American |date=21 September 2012 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}</ref>

Yen later went on to discover and to seek knowledge on other martial arts styles; he would later obtain respectively black and purple belts from [[judo]] and [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]], and went on to study the art of [[parkour]], wrestling, [[Muay Thai]], kickboxing and boxing under various trainers. His exposure to [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) was heightened when he went back to the United States from 2000 to 2003.  While making his Hollywood debut, he also took time off to learn the various martial arts forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flash_point/news/1716512/ten_questions_with_flash_point_star_donnie_yen/Ten |title=Questions with Flash Point Star Donnie Yen |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref> The progress was evident when he returned to Asia, where he implemented his newfound knowledge of MMA showcased in films such as ''[[SPL: Sha Po Lang]]'' (2005) and ''[[Flash Point (film)|Flash Point]]'' (2007).

Near the end of 2007, Yen added a new martial arts system to his arsenal. He was offered the role of [[Wing Chun]] grandmaster and [[Bruce Lee]]'s mentor, [[Yip Man|Ip Man]], in a 2008 [[Ip Man (film)|film named after the grandmaster]]. He worked hard and studied Wing Chun under Ip Man's eldest son, [[Ip Chun]] for 9 months before tackling the role.<ref>{{cite web|author=ShadowWarrior8038 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUs0zi-Omxg |title=Donnie Yen learning Wing Chun from Master Ip Chun |publisher=Youtube |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://wghot.wwwwang.com/content/200910/167376.shtml 甄子丹对《叶问》票房无信心 耍咏春拳赚口碑 |网网网络  ]</ref> Ip Chun has since praised Yen for his effort, and complimented that Yen is a great martial artist and a fast learner, and has managed to grasp the full concept of Wing Chun much faster than anyone else he has taught.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ent.people.com.cn/GB/8222/86596/195994/195995/12017243.html |title=《叶问前传》首映 叶准改口赞甄子丹学咏春很快Ip Chun says Yen learns Wing Chun Fast &#124; 人民网 People's news |work=People's Daily  |accessdate=17 December 2011}}</ref>

==Real fighting experience and prowess==
Donnie Yen was a rebel when he was young, due to the huge expectations and pressures from his parents as his mother is the founder of the Chinese Wushu Research Institute in [[Boston]] and his father was a scholar and a musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingmaster.com/actors/donnie_yen/ |title=Donnie Yen, the last Dragon|publisher=Fighting Master |accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref> Yen joined a Chinatown gang in Boston, MA, in his early years. Donnie Yen was a very curious teenager who seeks to exchange martial arts knowledge with people from different martial arts background, leading to him having profound knowledge in practical martial arts, and having a reputation as a street brawler.

There's one reported occasion that confirms him being an efficient martial artist. According to news reports by Hong Kong news channels in the late 1990s, Donnie Yen was at a [[nightclub]] with his then girlfriend, [[Joey Meng]]. Inside the nightclub, Joey got harassed by a troublesome gang who took an interest in her. Yen warned them of leaving them alone but to no success. As they got out, the gang followed them and proceeded to prevent Yen from intervening by attacking him. This resulted in Yen beating the assailants up in self-defense and getting arrested by the police but was released the next day.
