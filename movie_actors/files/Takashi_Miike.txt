'''Takashi Miike''' {{Nihongo||三池 崇史|Miike Takashi|born August 24, 1960}} is a highly prolific and controversial [[Japan]]ese [[filmmaker]]. He has directed over ninety theatrical, video, and television productions since his debut in 1991. Miike is credited with directing fifteen productions in the years 2001 and 2002 alone. His films range from violent and bizarre to dramatic and family-friendly.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Miike was born in [[Yao, Osaka]], Japan, an area inhabited by the working class and immigrants. His family was originally from [[Kumamoto Prefecture]]. During World War II, his grandfather was stationed in China and Korea, and his father was born in Seoul. His father worked as a welder and his mother as seamstress.<ref>Mes, Tom. ''Agitator: The Cinema of Takashi Miike''. Godalming: FAB Press, 2003. ISBN 1-903254-21-3. p. 15.</ref> Although he claimed to have attended classes only rarely, he graduated from [[Yokohama Vocational School of Broadcast and Film]] (Yokohama Hōsō Eiga Senmon Gakkō) under the guidance of renowned filmmaker [[Shohei Imamura]], the founder and Dean of that institution.<ref>Mes, pp. 16-18.</ref>

===Career===
Miike's first films were television productions, but he also began directing several [[direct-to-video]] [[V-Cinema]] releases. Miike still directs V-Cinema productions intermittently due to the creative freedom afforded by the less stringent [[censorship]] of the medium and the riskier content that the [[film producer|producers]] will allow.

Miike's theatrical debut was the film ''The Third Gangster'' (Daisan no gokudō).<ref>Agitator: The Cinema of Takashi Miike</ref> However it was ''Shinjuku Triad Society'' (1995) that was the first of his theatrical releases to gain public attention. The film showcased his extreme style and his recurring themes, and its success gave him the freedom to work on higher-budgeted pictures. ''Shinjuku Triad Society'' is also the first film in what is labeled his "Black Society Trilogy", which also includes ''Rainy Dog'' (1997) and ''Ley Lines'' (1999). He gained international fame in 2000 when his romantic horror film ''[[Audition (1999 film)|Audition]]'' (1999), his violent [[yakuza film|yakuza epic]] ''[[Dead or Alive (film)|Dead or Alive]]'' (1999), and his controversial adaptation of the manga ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]'' played at international film festivals. He has since gained a strong [[cult following]] in the [[Western world|West]] that is growing with the increase in [[DVD]] releases of his works. His latest film ''[[Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai]]'' premiered In Competition at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="Cannes2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/article/58041.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Official Selection |accessdate=2011-04-15|work=Cannes}}</ref> His 2013 film ''[[Straw Shield]]'' was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="Cannes2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/59652.html |title=2013 Official Selection|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2013|work=Cannes}}</ref>

===Themes of his work===
Miike has garnered international notoriety for depicting shocking scenes of extreme [[violence]] and [[paraphilia|sexual perversions]]. Many of his films contain graphic and lurid bloodshed, often portrayed in an over-the-top, cartoonish manner. Much of his work depicts the activities of [[crime|criminals]] (especially [[yakuza]]) or concern themselves with [[gaikokujin|non-Japanese]] living in Japan. He is known for his [[black comedy|dark sense of humor]] and for pushing the boundaries of censorship as far as they will go.

Despite his notorious reputation, Miike has also directed movies in a range of genres. He has created lighthearted children's films (''[[Zebraman]]'' and ''[[The Great Yokai War]]''), period pieces (''Sabu''), subdued pictures such as the [[road movie]] ''[[The Bird People in China]]'', a teen drama (Andoromedeia), a farcical musical-comedy-horror in ''[[The Happiness of the Katakuris]]'', and even a video game adaptation in ''[[Ace Attorney (film)|Ace Attorney]]''. Other less controversial works include ''[[Ley Lines (1999 film)|Ley Lines]]'' and ''[[Agitator (film)|Agitator]]'', which are character-driven crime dramas.

While Miike often creates films that are less accessible and target arthouse audiences and fans of [[extreme cinema]], such as ''[[Izo]]'' and the "Box" segment in ''[[Three... Extremes]]'', he has created several mainstream and commercial titles such as the [[horror film]] ''[[One Missed Call (2003 film)|One Missed Call]]'' and the [[fantasy]] drama ''[[The Great Yokai War]]''.

Miike claims that ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'' is his favorite movie.<ref>Interview Footage included in special features on American Region 1 DVD of ''Gozu''</ref> He admires film directors [[Akira Kurosawa]],<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/may/05/takeshi-miike-japanese-samurai-classics | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Phil | last=Hoad | title=Takashi Miike: Why I am bringing Japanese classics back to life | date=May 5, 2011}}</ref> [[Hideo Gosha]],<ref name="Guardian"/><ref name="Toei">[https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=268783396469656 Watashi to Toei Interview: Takashi Miike(Japanese)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[David Lynch]],<ref name="SGInterview">[http://suicidegirls.com/words/Takashi+Miike+director+of+Gozu/ SuicideGirls > Interviews > Takashi Miike Director Of Gozu<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[David Cronenberg]],<ref name="SGInterview"/> and [[Paul Verhoeven]].<ref name="SGInterview"/>

===Controversies===
One of his most controversial films was the ultra-violent ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]'' (2001), adapted from a [[manga]] of the same name and starring [[Tadanobu Asano]] as a [[sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] [[yakuza]] enforcer. The extreme violence was initially exploited to promote the film: during its international premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 2001, the audience received "barf bags" emblazoned with the film's logo as a promotional gimmick<ref>http://tiff.net/filmsandschedules/tiffbelllightbox/2011/201104270051105/</ref> (one typically flamboyant [[Splatter film|gory]] killing involves a character slicing a man in half from head to groin, and severing another's face, which then slides down a nearby wall).

However, the [[British Board of Film Classification]] refused to allow the release of the film uncut in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], citing its extreme levels of [[sexual violence]] towards women. In [[Hong Kong]], 15 minutes of footage were cut. In the United States it has been shown uncut ([[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|unrated]]). An uncut DVD was also released in the [[Benelux]].

In 2005, Miike was invited to direct an episode of the [[Masters of Horror]] anthology series. The series, featuring episodes by a range of established horror directors such as [[John Carpenter]], [[Tobe Hooper]] and [[Dario Argento]], was supposed to provide directors with relative creative freedom and relaxed restrictions on violent and sexual content (some violent content was edited from the [[Dario Argento]]-directed episode ''[[Jenifer (Masters of Horror episode)|Jenifer]]''). However, when the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network acquired the rights to the series, the Miike-directed episode ''[[Imprint (Masters of Horror episode)|Imprint]]'' was deemed too disturbing for the network. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cancelled it from the broadcast lineup even after extended negotiations, though it was retained as part of the series' DVD release. [[Mick Garris]], creator and executive producer of the series, described the episode as "amazing, but hard even for me to watch... definitely the most disturbing film I've ever seen".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/19/arts/television/19horr.html | work=The New York Times | title=Horror Film Made for Showtime Will Not Be Shown | first=Dave | last=Kehr | date=January 19, 2006 | accessdate=May 24, 2010}}</ref>

While ''[[Imprint (Masters of Horror episode)|Imprint]]'' has yet to air in the United States, it has aired on Bravo in the UK, on FX in Mexico, South and Central America, the Dominican Republic, France, Israel, Turkey, on [[Nelonen]] in Finland and on [[Rai Tre]] in Italy. Anchor Bay Entertainment, which has handled the DVD releases for the [[Masters of Horror]] series in the US, released ''[[Imprint (Masters of Horror episode)|Imprint]]'' on R1 DVD on September 26, 2006.
