'''Evelyn Nelson''' (November 13, 1899 - June 16, 1923) was an American silent film actress. 

==Biography==
Nelson was born in [[Chloride, Arizona]] to William Henry and Georgia P. Nelson. She had a sister named Pauline D. Nelson who was older by one year.

Nelson's brief film career began with a 1920 comedy short called ''Springtime''. The actress played the role of the daughter to ''The Commissioner'', who was portrayed by [[Oliver Hardy]]. Her screen credits number only fifteen. Nelson was last seen in the western ''Desert Rider'' (1923) in the role of "Carolyn Grey."

In 1923 the actress was found dead in a gas-filled room by her mother, Mrs. Georgia P. Nelson. The two women resided at 6281 De Longpre Avenue in [[Los Angeles, California]]. The body was found after the mother returned from a visit to her son-in-law Charles L. King. The star of [[Hollywood]] comedies had not been seen for days and it was presumed she had been dead for some time.

Nelson left two notes in her room which were found by police. One stated she intended to end her life because she was tired. The other said "I am just about gone and will soon be with my friend Wally." [[Wallace Reid]] was a popular actor of that era who died after a struggle with [[narcotics]] dependency, just a few months before Evelyn. She was 23 years old. A police investigation into her death evidently did not contradict the apparent suicide. {{citation needed|date=February 2010}}
