'''Ann Little''' (February 7, 1891 – May 21, 1984) was an American film actress whose career was most prolific during the [[silent film]] era of the early 1910s through the early 1920s.

==Life and career==
Born '''Mary Brooks''' on a ranch near the town of [[Mount Shasta, California]], she began appearing in a traveling stock theater group after graduating high school. After briefly relocating to [[San Francisco]] in the early 1910s, she made the transition to films; first appearing in one-reel [[Western (genre)|Western]] shorts with actor and director [[Broncho Billy Anderson]]. Her first film appearance was in the 1911 release ''The Indian Maiden's Lesson'' as a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] named 'Red Feather'. Little would often appear as Native American characters in many of her earliest films.

By 1912, Little was appearing regularly in [[Thomas H. Ince]] directed Western-themed serials, often as an "Indian princess" and usually starring opposite [[Francis Ford (actor)|Francis Ford]], [[Grace Cunard]], [[Olive Tell]], [[Jack Conway (filmmaker)|Jack Conway]], [[Ethel Grandin]], early American child actress [[Mildred Harris]] and notable early cowboy star [[Art Acord]] for [[Essanay Studios]]. Between 1911 and 1914, Little would appear in approximately sixty shorts, the overwhelming majority of them Westerns and many of them serials that ran in installments. Other notable co-stars of the era included [[Harold Lockwood]], [[Jane Wolfe]], [[William Worthington (actor)|William Worthington]], [[Tom Chatterton]], and actor/director [[Frank Borzage]].

Although possibly best recalled for her appearances in Westerns, Ann Little showed versatility as an actress by appearing in a number of well received roles in other dramatic genres and even comedies. Most notably among her dramatic roles was the early American cinematic [[American Civil War|Civil War]] serials directed by [[William J. Bauman]] and Thomas Ince. Another notable film of the period was the 1914 Ruth Ann Baldwin penned and [[Allan Dwan]] adapted epic ''Damon and Pythias'', which included a cast of thousands of extras. While signed under contract to [[Universal Studios]], she would make nearly six serials, most of them Western-themed one and two-reel dramas.

By 1917, Little was signed to [[Paramount Pictures]] and often being paired with the highly successful actor [[Wallace Reid]] in a number of popular dramas and comedies, and while allegedly tired of being typecast as an actress of Western serials starred opposite cowboy actor [[Jack Hoxie]] in the popular 1919 serial ''Lightning Bryce''. By the early 1920s however, Little would only take dramatic roles outside of the Western genre. Notable films of the period include the race-car adventure films ''[[The Roaring Road]]'' (1919) and ''[[Excuse My Dust]]'' (1920) with Wallace Reid, ''The Cradle of Courage'' with [[William S. Hart]] and the crime-drama ''The Greatest Menace'' (1923) opposite [[Wilfred Lucas]].

==Later years==
While still at the peak of her public popularity, Ann Little retired from the motion picture industry in the early 1930s. In her later years she managed the [[Chateau Marmont Hotel|Chateau Marmont]] on the [[Sunset Strip]] but rarely spoke of her years in acting.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/2013/0501/Life-at-the-Marmont-6-stories-of-Hollywood-stars-at-the-famous-hotel/Workaholic-Billy-Wilder|journal=The Christian Science Monitor|title=Life at the Marmont': 6 stories of Hollywood stars at the famous hotel|date=May 1, 2013}}</ref>
