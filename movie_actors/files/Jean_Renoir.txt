'''Jean Renoir''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁənwaʁ|lang}}; 15 September 1894 &ndash; 12 February 1979) was a French [[film director]], screenwriter, actor, producer and author. As a film director and actor, he made more than forty films from the [[silent film|silent era]] to the end of the 1960s. His films ''[[Grand Illusion (film)|Grand Illusion]]'' (1937) and ''[[The Rules of the Game]]'' (1939) are often cited by critics as among the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. He was ranked by the [[British Film Institute|BFI]]'s ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' poll of critics in 2002 as the fourth greatest director of all time.<ref>[http://archive.is/tqYVO "The Critics’ Top Ten Directors"], ''Sight & Sound'' poll [2002]</ref> Among numerous honors accrued during his lifetime, he received a Lifetime Achievement [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 1975 for his contribution to the motion picture industry. Renoir was the son of the painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. 

==Early life and early career==
[[File:Gabrielle et Jean, by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, from C2RMF cropped.jpg|right|thumb|The young Renoir with [[Gabrielle Renard]] in a painting by his father [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]].]]

Renoir was born in the [[Montmartre]] district of Paris, France. He was the second son of Aline (née Charigot) Renoir and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], the renowned painter. His elder brother was [[Pierre Renoir]], a French stage and film actor, and his younger brother Claude Renoir (1901–1969) had a brief minor career in the film industry, mostly assisting on a few of Jean's films.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2039967</ref> Renoir was also the uncle of [[Claude Renoir]] (1913–1993), the son of Pierre, a [[cinematography|cinematographer]] who worked with Jean Renoir on several of his films. 

Renoir was largely raised by [[Gabrielle Renard]], his nanny and his mother's cousin, with whom he developed a strong bond. Shortly before his birth, she had come to live with the Renoir family.<ref>''My Life and My Films'', p. 16</ref> She introduced the young boy to the [[Guignol]] puppet shows in Montmartre, which influenced his later film career. He wrote in his 1974 memoirs ''My Life and My Films'', "She taught me to see the face behind the mask and the fraud behind the flourishes. She taught me to detest the cliché."<ref>''My Life and My Films'', pp. 29, 282</ref> Gabrielle was also fascinated by the new [[History of film|motion-picture invention]], and when Renoir was only a few years old she took him to see his first film. 

As a child, Renoir moved to the south of France with his family. He and the rest of the Renoir family were the subjects of many of his father's paintings. His father's financial success ensured that the young Renoir was educated at fashionable [[boarding school]]s, from which, as he later wrote, he frequently ran away.<ref>Renoir, Jean. ''Renoir My Father'', Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1962, pp. 417-419; 425-429</ref>

At the outbreak of World War I, Renoir was serving in the French cavalry. Later, after receiving a bullet in his leg, he served as a reconnaissance pilot.<ref>Durgnat, Raymond. ''Jean Renoir'', Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1974, pp. 27-28</ref> His leg injury left him with a permanent limp, but allowed him to discover the cinema, as he recuperated by watching films with his leg elevated; seeing the works of  [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[D. W. Griffith]] and others.<ref>Renoir, Jean. ''My Life and My Films'', New York: Atheneum, 1974, pp. 40-43</ref><ref>''Renoir My Father'', pp. 417-19.</ref> After the war, Renoir followed his father's suggestion and tried his hand at making [[ceramic]]s, but he soon set that aside to make films. He was particularly inspired by [[Erich von Stroheim]]'s work.<ref>''My Life and My Films'', pp. 47-48.</ref><ref>"Memories" by Jean Renoir, reprinted from ''Le Point,'' XVIII, December 1938 in Bazin, Andre. ''Jean Renoir'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973, pp. 151-152</ref>

In 1924, Renoir directed ''Une Vie Sans Joie'' or ''Catherine,'' the first of his nine silent films, most of which starred his first wife, [[Catherine Hessling]]. She was also his father's last model.<ref>Durgnat, p. 29. The name of the film was ''Une Vie Sans Joie'' or ''Catherine''.</ref>  At this stage, his films did not produce a return. Renoir gradually sold paintings inherited from his father to finance them.<ref>''My Life and My Films'', pp. 81-85</ref>

==International success in the 1930s==
During the 1930s Renoir enjoyed great success as a filmmaker.  In 1931 he directed his first [[sound film]]s, ''[[On purge bébé]]'' (''Baby's Laxative'')<ref>Durgnat, p. 64</ref> and ''[[La Chienne]]'' (''The Bitch'').<ref>Durgnat, p. 68</ref> The following year he made ''[[Boudu Saved From Drowning]]'' (''Boudu sauvé des eaux''), a farcical sendup of the pretensions of a middle-class bookseller and his family, who meet with comic, and ultimately disastrous, results when they attempt to reform a vagrant played by [[Michel Simon]].<ref>Durgnat, pp. 85-87</ref>

By the middle of the decade, Renoir was associated with the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]]. Several of his films, such as ''[[The Crime of Monsieur Lange]]'' (''Le Crime de Monsieur Lange'', 1935), ''[[Life Belongs to Us]]'' (1936) and ''[[La Marseillaise (film)|La Marseillaise]]'' (1938), reflect the movement's politics.<ref>''My Life and My Films'', pp. 124-127</ref><ref>Durgnat, pp. 108-131</ref>

In 1937 he made what became one of his best-known films, ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'', starring [[Erich von Stroheim]] and [[Jean Gabin]]. A film on the theme of brotherhood, relating a series of escape attempts by French [[POW]]s during [[World War I]], it was enormously successful. It was banned in Germany, and later in Italy, after having won the "Best Artistic Ensemble" award at the [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref>Bazin, Andre. ''Jean Renoir'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973, pp. 56-66</ref> It was the first foreign language film to receive a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].

He followed it with ''[[La Bête Humaine (film)|The Human Beast]]'' (''La Bête Humaine'') (1938), a [[film noir]] [[tragedy]] based on the novel by [[Émile Zola]] and starring [[Simone Simon]] and [[Jean Gabin]], this also was a cinematic success.<ref>Durgnat, pp. 172-184</ref>

In 1939, able to co-finance his own films,<ref>Durgnat, p. 185.</ref> Renoir made ''[[The Rules of the Game]]'' (''La Règle du Jeu''), a [[satire]] on contemporary French society with an ensemble cast.<ref>Gilliatt, Penelope. ''Jean Renoir: Essays, Conversations, Reviews'', New York: McGraw Hill Book Company, 1975, p. 59</ref> Renoir played the character Octave, who acts as a sort of master of ceremonies in the film.<ref>Renoir, Jean. ''An Interview: Jean Renoir'', Copenhagen: Green Integer Books, 1998, p. 67</ref> The film was his greatest commercial failure,<ref>Volk, Carol. ''Renoir on Renoir: Interviews, Essays and Remarks'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, p. 236</ref> met with derision by Parisian audiences at its premiere. He extensively reedited the work, but without success.<ref>Durgnat, pp. 189-190</ref>

A few weeks after the outbreak of World War II, the film was banned by the government. The ban was lifted briefly in 1940, but after the fall of France that June, it was banned again.<ref name="Durgnat, page 191">Durgnant, 191</ref>  Subsequently the original negative of the film was destroyed in an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing raid.<ref name="Durgnat, page 191"/> It was not until the 1950s that French film enthusiasts Jean Gaborit and Jacques Durand, with Renoir's cooperation, reconstructed a near-complete print of the film.<ref>Faulkner, Christopher, ''Jean Renoir, a guide to references and resources'', Boston, Massachusetts: G.K. Hall & Company, 1979, p. 34</ref><ref>Gilliatt, p. 60</ref>  Since screenings and reappraisals since the 1960s, ''The Rules of the Game'' has frequently appeared near the top of critics' polls of [[Films considered the greatest ever|the best films ever made]].<ref>[http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/critics.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Wayback |date=20070826201343 |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/specials/take/one/full_list.php3?category=10 |title="Take One: The First Annual Village Voice Film Critics' Poll"}}.

==Hollywood years==
A week after the disastrous premiere of ''The Rules of the Game'' in July 1939, Renoir went to Rome with [[Carl Koch (director)|Karl Koch]] and Dido Freire, subsequently his second wife, to work on the script for a film version of ''[[Tosca]]''.<ref name="Durgnat, page 213">Durgnat, p. 213.</ref><ref>David Thompson and Lorraine LoBianco (ed.) ''Jean Renoir: Letters'', London: Faber & Faber, 1994, p. 61</ref> He abandoned the project to return to France in August 1939, and make himself available for military service.<ref>''Jean Renoir: Letters'', pp. 61, 64</ref> At the age of 45, he became a lieutenant in the French Army Film Service. He was sent  back to Italy, to teach film at the [[Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia]] in Rome, and resume work on ''[[Tosca]]''.<ref name="Durgnat, page 213"/><ref name="Films pages 175-176">''My Life and My Films'', pp. 175-176</ref><ref>''Jean Renoir: Letters'', pp. 62-65.</ref> The [[French government]] hoped this cultural exchange would help maintain friendly relations with Italy, which had not yet entered the war.<ref name="Durgnat, page 213">Durgnat, p. 213</ref><ref name="Films pages 175-176"/><ref>Thompson and LoBianco, p. 65</ref> 
As war approached, however, Renoir returned to France.<ref name="Durgnat, page 213"/><ref>''My Life and My Films'', p. 177</ref> After Germany invaded France in May 1940, he fled to the United States with Dido Freire.<ref>Durgnat, p. 222.</ref><ref>Thompson and LoBianco, p. 87</ref>

In [[Hollywood]], Renoir had difficulty finding projects that suited him.<ref>Volk, pp. 10-30</ref> His first American film, ''[[Swamp Water]]'' (1941), was a drama starring [[Dana Andrews]] and [[Walter Brennan]]. In 1943, he co-produced and directed an anti-[[Nazi]] film set in France, ''[[This Land Is Mine (film)|This Land Is Mine]]'', starring [[Maureen O'Hara]] and [[Charles Laughton]].<ref>Durgnat, pp. 234-236.</ref><ref>Thompson and LoBianco, p. 183</ref> Two years later, he made ''[[The Southerner (1945 film)|The Southerner]]'', a film about [[Texas]] [[sharecropping|sharecroppers]] that is often regarded as his best American film. He was nominated  for an [[Academy Award for Directing]] for this work.<ref>Durgnat, p. 244</ref><ref>Bazin, p. 103</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1244403102038 |title=Session Timeout - Academy Awards® Database - AMPAS |publisher=Awardsdatabase.oscars.org |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref>

In 1945 he made ''[[The Diary of a Chambermaid (1946 film)|Diary of a Chambermaid]]'', an adaptation of the [[Octave Mirbeau]] novel, ''Le Journal d'une femme de chambre'', starring [[Paulette Goddard]] and [[Burgess Meredith]].<ref>Thompson and LoBianco, pp. 165-169.</ref><ref>Durgnat, p. 252.</ref> His ''[[The Woman on the Beach]]'' (1947), starring [[Joan Bennett]] and [[Robert Ryan]], was heavily reshot and reedited after it fared poorly among preview audiences in California.<ref>Durgnat, p. 261.</ref> Both films were poorly received; they were the last films Renoir made in America.<ref>Durgnat, p. 259.</ref><ref>Volk, p. 24.</ref><ref>''My Life and My Films'', p. 247</ref> At this time, Renoir became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.<ref>Thompson and LoBianco, pp. 207, 270</ref>

==Post-Hollywood career==
In 1949 Renoir traveled to India and made ''[[The River (1951 film)|The River]]'', his first color film.<ref>Durgnat, pp. 273-274</ref> Based on the novel of the same name by [[Rumer Godden]], the film is both a meditation on human beings' relationship with nature and a [[coming of age]] story of three young girls in [[colonial India]].<ref>Durgnat, pp. 273, 275-276</ref> The film won the International Prize at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1951.<ref>Durgnat, p. 284</ref>

After returning to work in Europe, Renoir made a trilogy of [[Technicolor]] [[musical comedy|musical comedies]] on the subjects of theater, politics and commerce: ''[[The Golden Coach|Le Carrosse d'or]]'' (''The Golden Coach'') (1953) with [[Anna Magnani]]; ''[[French Cancan]]'' (1954) with [[Jean Gabin]] and [[María Félix]]; and ''[[Eléna et les hommes]]'' (''Elena and Her Men'', 1956) with [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Jean Marais]].<ref>Durgnat, p. 400</ref> During the same period Renoir produced [[Clifford Odets]]' play ''[[The Big Knife]]'' in Paris. He also wrote his own play, ''[[Orvet]]'', and produced it in Paris featuring [[Leslie Caron]].<ref>Faulkner, pp. 33-34</ref><ref>''My Life and My Films'', pp. 274-275</ref>

In 1959 Renoir made his next films with techniques adapted from live television.<ref>Renoir, Jean. ''Ecrits 1926-1971'', Paris: Pierre Belfond, 1974, pp. 286-289</ref> ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (''Picnic on the Grass''), starring Paul Meurisse and [[Catherine Rouvel]], was filmed on the grounds of Pierre-Auguste Renoir's home in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]], and ''[[Le Testament du docteur Cordelier]]'' (''The Testament of Doctor Cordelier''), starring [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], was made in the streets of Paris and its suburbs.<ref>''My Life and My Films'', p. 277</ref><ref>''Ecrits 1926-1971'', pp. 292-294</ref>

In 1962 Renoir made what was to be his penultimate film, ''[[Le Caporal épinglé]]'' (''The Elusive Corporal'') with [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]] and [[Claude Brasseur]].<ref>Bazin, p. 300-301</ref> Set among French POWs during their internment in labor camps by the Nazis during World War II, the film explores the twin human needs for freedom, on the one hand, and emotional and economic security, on the other.<ref>Durgnat, pp. 357-367.</ref><ref>Bazin, pp. 301-4</ref>

In 1962, Renoir published a loving memoir of his father, ''[[Renoir, My Father]]'', in which he described the profound influence his father had on him and his work.<ref>Durgnat, pp. 368-372</ref> As funds for his film projects were becoming harder to obtain, Renoir continued to write screenplays for income. He published a novel, ''[[The Notebooks of Captain Georges]]'', in 1966.<ref>Durgnat, p. 373</ref><ref>Faulkner, pp. 37-38</ref> ''Captain Georges'' is the nostalgic account of a wealthy young man's sentimental education and love for a [[peasant]] girl, a theme also explored earlier in his films ''[[The Diary of a Chambermaid (1946 film)|Diary of a Chambermaid]]'' and ''[[Picnic on the Grass]]''.<ref>Thompson and LoBianco, p. 455, 463</ref>

==Last years==
Renoir made his last film in 1969, ''[[The Little Theatre of Jean Renoir|Le Petit théâtre de Jean Renoir]]'' (''The Little Theatre of Jean Renoir'').<ref>Bazin, p. 306</ref> The film is a series of four short films made in a variety of styles. It is, in many ways, one of his most challenging, avant-garde and unconventional works.<ref>''My Life and My Films'', pp. 277-278.</ref><ref>Rohmer, Eric. "''Notes sur Le Petit théâtre de Jean Renoir''", in ''Cinema 79'' No. 244, April 1979, pp. 20-24</ref>

Unable to obtain financing for his films and suffering declining health, Renoir spent his last years receiving friends at his home in Beverly Hills, and writing novels and his memoirs.<ref>Thompson and LoBianco, pp. 509-553</ref>

In 1973 Renoir was preparing a production of his stage play, ''[[Carola]],'' with [[Leslie Caron]] and [[Mel Ferrer]] when he fell ill and was unable to direct. The producer [[Norman Lloyd (actor)|Norman Lloyd]], a friend and actor in ''The Southerner'', took over the direction of the play. It was broadcast in the series program ''Hollywood Television Theater'' on WNET, Channel 13, New York on February 3, 1973.<ref name="Faulkner, page 40">Faulkner, p. 40</ref>

Renoir published his memoirs, ''[[My Life and My Films]]'', in 1974.

He concluded his memoirs with the words he had often spoken as a child, "Wait for me, Gabrielle."<ref>''My Life and My Films'', p. 282</ref>

In 1975 Renoir received a lifetime [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his contribution to the motion picture industry. That same year a retrospective of his work was shown at the [[BFI Southbank|National Film Theatre]] in London.<ref>Faulkner, pp. 40-41</ref> Also in 1975, the government of France elevated him to the rank of commander in the [[Légion d'honneur]].<ref name="Interview page 18">''An Interview: Jean Renoir'', p. 18</ref>

Jean Renoir died in [[Beverly Hills, California]] on February 12, 1979.
