{{Main|Suresh Gopi filmography}}

===1986–1991===
He returned to acting in the mid-1980s with [[Sathyan Anthikkad]]'s ''[[T.P. Balagopalan M.A.]]'' (1986), where he played a prospective groom in a small scene. He went on to play [[supporting actor|supporting]] and [[villain]] roles. Some other roles of his include Balan in ''[[Nandi Veendum Varika]]'' (1986), Kumar in ''[[Rajavinte Makan]]'' (1986), Vinod in ''[[January Oru Orma]]'' (1987), Shekaran Kutty in ''[[Irupatham Noottandu]]'' (1987), Suresh in ''[[New Delhi (1987 film)|New Delhi]]'' (1987), Harry in ''[[Oru CBI Diary Kurippu]]'' (1988), Unni in ''[[1921 (Malayalam film)|1921]]'' (1988), and Aromal Chekavar in ''[[Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha]]'' (1989). He played the comic role of Inspector "Minnal" Prathapan in ''[[Manu Uncle]]'' (1988) and of Dr. Narendran in [[Padmarajan]]'s ''[[Innale]]'' (1989).

He played Sethumadhavan in [[Siddique (director)|Siddique]]-[[Lal (actor)|Lal]]'s blockbuster ''[[In Harihar Nagar]]'' (1990). Another role was of Christopher Luke in [[Viji Thampi]]'s ''[[Nagarangalil Chennu Raparkam]]'' (1990). The film that helped him get noticed as a serious police officer was the satirical comedy ''[[Aanaval Mothiram]]'' (1990), where he played Sub-Inspector Nandakumar and co-starred with [[Sreenivasan (actor)|Sreenivasan]].

===1992–1999===
The films that made Suresh Gopi a bankable lead actor were ''[[Thalastaanam]]'' (1992), ''[[Ekalavyan (film)|Ekalavyan]]'' (1993), ''Mafia'' (1993) and ''[[Commissioner (film)|Commissioner]]'' (1994), all by [[Shaji Kailas]] and scripted by [[Ranji Panicker]]. All of them were police dramas and had, more or less, similar themes. He became immensely popular with his role as Bharathchandran IPS in the successful movie ''Commissioner''. Renji Panicker's dialogues employed by Suresh Gopi in English became quite popular with the masses.

During this period, most of his films were dubbed and simultaneously released in Telugu, which made him popular in [[Andhra Pradesh]].

During the early to mid-1990s, he also played characters of substance in films such as [[Jayaraj]]'s ''[[Paithrukam]]'' (1993), Fazil's ''[[Manichithrathazhu]]'' which was a blockbuster hit, [[Sathyan Anthikkad]]'s ''Samooham'' (1993) and [[Sibi Malayil]]'s ''Sindoora Rekha'' (1995).

The success of his cop roles led to more films of such nature, where he either played police officers or other tough characters in films such as ''[[City Police (film)|City Police]], ''[[The City (1994 film)|The City]], ''Rudraksham'' (1994), ''[[Kashmeeram]]'' (1994), and ''Mahatma'' (1996). He was called the 'Angry Young Man' of Mollywood, similar to the title given to [[Amitabh Bachchan]] in Bollywood.

In 1997, with Jayaraj's ''[[Kaliyattam]]'' (1997), an adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'', Suresh Gopi won the [[National Film Award for Best Actor]] for playing Kannan Perumalayan.  

In the late 1990s, Suresh Gopi was noted for playing in [[Joshiy|Joshi]]'s films such as ''[[Lelam]]'' (1998), ''Vazhunnor'' (1999) and ''[[Pathram]]'' (1999), again the former and the latter, scripted by [[Ranji Panicker]]. He played [[Nasrani]] characters Chackochi and Kuttappai in ''Lelam'' and ''Vazhunnor'' respectively, as these two films became blockbuster successes in box office. Another notable role was that of journalist Nandagopal in ''Pathram'' where he co-starred with [[Manju Warrier]]. Suresh Gopi, [[Jayaram]], and Manju Warrier teamed up in Sibi Malayil's ''[[Summer in Bethlahem]]'' (1998).

=== 2000–2009 ===
He started off 2000 with ''[[Millennium Stars]]'' directed by [[Jayaraj]]. The movie made a loss in ticket sales and severely affected the careers of all the stars involved. But he had a success later the same year in ''[[Thenkasipattanam]]''. After 2000, when his films were doing fairly well, he decided to stop acting in movies depicting violence, a decision he would later regret. It was also rumoured that he was giving up his acting career for pursuing a political career. He acted in off-beat movies and accepted only soft roles from 2001 to 2005. With his movies failing to make an impact, he had just one release each in 2002 and 2003. In 2005, he decided to return to action movies. [[Ranji Panicker]], scriptwriter of his most successful movie, ''[[Commissioner (film)|Commissioner]]'', directed the sequel ''[[Bharathchandran I.P.S.]]'' portraying him as the police commissioner. This was followed by a number of movies in the same genre, in which he played the typical police officer or detective. Some of them were successful, like ''[[The Tiger (2005 film)|The Tiger]]'', ''[[Chinthamani Kolacase]]'' directed by [[Shaji Kailas]], ''[[Nadiya Kollappetta Rathri]]'' directed by K. Madhu and ''[[Detective (2007 film)|Detective]]''. All the others, such as ''[[Time (2007 film)|Time]]'', ''Aayudham'', ''Thavalam'', ''Rashtram'', ''Pathaka'', ''Bullet'' and ''Smart City'', were commercially unsuccessful. In between he attempted to do a different role with negative shades in ''[[Lanka (2006 film)|Lanka]]'' which, did not perform well at the box office and ignited a controversy for an unaesthetic kissing scene with his female co-star, [[Mamta Mohandas]]. In 2006 he reunited with his favourite director Shaji Kailas for the movie ''[[Time (2006 film)|Time]]'', which had huge expectations but did not perform well at the box office. It was dubbed into Telugu as ''Police Ante Veedera'' and Hindi as ''On Duty'', but failed to fetch better results.

Before coming to the film world, he had displayed great interest in the field of literature; his favourite authors are [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] and [[Shakespeare]]. He is famous for his philanthropic efforts.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

In 2008 Suresh Gopi appeared in multi-starrer ''[[Twenty:20 (film)|Twenty: 20]]'' produced by [[Association of Malayalam Movie Artists|AMMA]]. Again, he acted with [[Mohanlal]] in ''[[Pakal Nakshatrangal]]'', an off-beat movie directed by Rajiv Nath.

===2010–present===
In 2010 he appeared with [[Mohanlal]], [[Dileep (actor)|Dileep]] and [[Sarath Kumar]] for another multi-starrer ''[[Christian Brothers (film)|Christian Brothers]]''.In 2011 Suresh Gopi acted in the critically lauded film [[Melvilasom]].In 2012 he acted in ''[[The King & the Commissioner]]'' with [[Mammootty]] .The movie received mixed reviews from the critics.
