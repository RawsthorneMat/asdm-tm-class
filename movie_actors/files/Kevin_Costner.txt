'''Kevin Michael Costner''' (born January 15, 1955) is an American actor, film director, producer, musician, and singer.

He has won two [[Academy Awards]], three [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and one [[Emmy Award]], and has been nominated for three BAFTA ([[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]) Awards. Costner's notable roles include [[Eliot Ness]] in ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'', Crash Davis in ''[[Bull Durham]]'', [[Shoeless Joe (novel)#Characters|Ray Kinsella]] in ''[[Field of Dreams]]'', Lt. John J. Dunbar in ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', [[Jim Garrison]] in ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', [[Robin Hood]] in ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'', Frank Farmer in ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' and [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Jonathan Kent]] in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''. Less well-liked were the science fiction-post-apocalyptic epics ''[[Waterworld]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' (1997), the latter starring, directed and produced by Costner, although both went on to garner significant [[cult followings]].

He won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie]], the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film]], and the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie]] for his role as [[Devil Anse Hatfield]] in ''[[Hatfields & McCoys (miniseries)|Hatfields & McCoys]]'' (2012) and starred in and produced ''[[Black or White (film)|Black or White]]'' (2014).

==Early life==
Costner was born in [[Lynwood, California]] and grew up in [[Compton, California]]. He is the youngest of three boys (the middle of whom died at birth). His mother, Sharon Rae (née Tedrick), was a [[Social security|welfare]] worker, and his father, William Costner, was an [[electrician]] and later utilities [[Senior management|executive]] at [[Southern California Edison]].<ref name="autobiog">Todd Keith, Kevin Costner: The Unauthorized Biography, Ikonprint Publishers: Southwark, London (1991)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pc/Kevin_Costner.html|title=The religion of Kevin Costner, actor and film director|work=adherents.com}}</ref> Costner's patrilineal heritage originates with [[German American|German]] immigrants to [[North Carolina]] in the 1700s;<ref name=tca>Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2001</ref> he also has [[English American|English]], [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Scottish American|Scottish]], [[Welsh American|Welsh]], and other German, ancestry.<ref name="ref2">{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Harper|title=Costner's Waltz with the West ...

Spending his teenage years in various parts of California as his father's career progressed,<ref name=tca/> Costner has described this as a period when he "lost a lot of confidence", having to make new friends often.<ref name=tca/> Costner lived in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], then in [[Visalia, California|Visalia]] ([[Tulare County]]), attending [[Mt. Whitney High School]], and then [[Ventura, California|Ventura]], graduating from Villa Park High School in 1973. He went on to earn a BA in marketing and finance from [[California State University, Fullerton]] (CSUF) in 1978.<ref name=tca/> While at CSUF, he was a fraternity brother in [[Delta Chi]].

==Post-graduation==
Costner became interested in acting while in his last year of college,<ref name=tca/> and on graduation married Cindy Silva. The couple honeymooned in [[Puerto Vallarta]] and on the return plane journey had a chance encounter with actor and fellow passenger [[Richard Burton]], who had purchased all the seats around him for solitude. Burton agreed to speak to Costner after he finished his book. Costner, who had been taking acting classes, but had not told his wife about his desire to be an actor, watched Burton closely and approached when Burton gestured. Costner told Burton that he would prefer that his life was not filled with the type of drama that had followed Burton and asked if he would have to tolerate that if he became an actor. Burton replied, "You have green eyes. I have green eyes. I think you'll be fine." After landing, Burton's limousine pulled up to the curb where Costner and Cindy were waiting for a taxi, where Burton wished Costner luck. Costner would never see Burton again, but credits Burton with partially contributing to his career.<ref name="autobiog"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080703/PEOPLE/994132453 |title=Kevin Costner: 'I'll never make a sequel.' |author=[[Roger Ebert]] |publisher=[[Sun-Times]] |date=July 3, 2008}}</ref>

Having agreed to undertake a job as a marketing executive on return, Costner began taking acting lessons five nights a week, with the support of his wife.<ref name=tca/> His marketing job lasted 30 days. He took work which allowed him to develop his acting skills via tuition, including working on fishing boats, as a truck driver, and giving tours of stars' Hollywood homes to support the couple while he also made the audition rounds.<ref name="autobiog"/>

==Career==

===Acting===
[[File:Kevin Costner 2003.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Costner at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
Costner allegedly made his film debut in the film ''[[Sizzle Beach, U.S.A.]]''. Although a biography claims it was actually filmed in the winter of 1978–79, the film was not released until 1986. Costner made a very brief appearance in the [[Ron Howard]] film ''[[Night Shift (film)|Night Shift]]'' (1982). He is listed in the credits as 'Frat Boy No.&nbsp;1' and appears at the climax of a frat-style, blow-out party in the New York City morgue, when the music is suddenly stopped by a frantic Henry Winkler. Costner can be seen holding a beer and looking surprised at the sudden halt of celebration.

He appeared in a commercial for the [[Apple Lisa]] and ''[[Table for Five]]'' in 1983, and, the same year, had a small role in the nuclear holocaust film ''[[Testament (film)|Testament]]''. Later, he was cast in ''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]'' and filmed several scenes that were planned as flashbacks, but they were removed from the final cut.<ref name=tca/> His role was that of Alex, the friend who committed suicide, the event that brings the rest of the cast together. All that is seen of him are his hair and his slashed wrists as the [[undertaker|mortician]] dresses his [[Cadaver|corpse]] in the movie's opening scenes.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085244/trivia|title=The Big Chill (1983)|work=IMDb}}</ref> Costner was a friend of director [[Lawrence Kasdan]], who promised the actor a role in a future project.<ref name=tca/> That became ''[[Silverado (film)|Silverado]]'' (1985) and a breakout role for Costner.<ref name=tca/> He also starred that year in the smaller films ''[[Fandango (1985 film)|Fandango]]'' and ''[[American Flyers]]'' and appeared alongside [[Kiefer Sutherland]] in a one-hour long special episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazing Stories; The Mission|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0511124/|accessdate=May 17, 2013}}</ref>

Full-blown movie star status for Costner arrived in 1987, when he starred as federal agent [[Eliot Ness]] in ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' and in the leading role of the thriller ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]''.<ref name=tca/> He solidified his A-list status in the baseball-themed films ''[[Bull Durham]]'' (1988) and ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989).<ref name=tca/>
Costner's next success came with the epic ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990).<ref name=tca/> He directed and starred in the film and served as one of its producers.<ref name=tca/> The film was nominated for 12 [[Academy Awards]] and won seven, including two for him personally ([[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]]).<ref name=tca/> The same year saw the release of ''[[Revenge (1990 film)|Revenge]]'', in which he starred along with [[Anthony Quinn]] and [[Madeleine Stowe]], directed by [[Tony Scott]] (Costner had wanted to direct it himself).

He followed this with ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'' (1991), the [[Oliver Stone]]-directed ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991), ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992), and [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[A Perfect World]]'' (1993), all of which provided box office or critical acclaim.<ref name=tca/>
He then took the title role in the biopic ''[[Wyatt Earp (film)|Wyatt Earp]]'' (1994), directed by Kasdan. It received mixed reviews and flopped{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} at the box office. ''[[The War (1994 film)|The War]]'', also made in 1994, seemed to gain little attention. The science fiction-[[post-apocalyptic]] epics ''[[Waterworld]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' (1997), the latter of which Costner also directed, were both commercial disappointments and both largely regarded by critics as artistic failures.<ref name=tca/> However, ''The Postman'' results were worse than ''Waterworld'' and ended up "winning" five [[Golden Raspberry Awards]], including Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Director for Costner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1998 |title=18th Annual Golden Raspeberry Awards |author=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=November 2, 2010}}</ref>
Costner then starred in the golf comedy ''[[Tin Cup]]'' (1996) for [[Ron Shelton]], who had previously directed him in ''Bull Durham''.<ref name=tca/> He developed the film ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' and was set to play the lead role of the President, but ultimately decided to concentrate on finishing ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' instead. He personally offered the project to [[Harrison Ford]]. In 1999, he starred in ''[[Message in a Bottle (film)|Message in a Bottle]] '' with Robin Wright-Penn. This was based on a novel of the same name By Nicholas Sparks.

[[File:Kevin Costner DF-SD-05-08959 crop.jpg|thumb|Costner visiting [[Andrews Air Force Base]] in July 2003.]]
His career revived somewhat in 2000 with ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'', in which he portrayed a top adviser to [[John F. Kennedy]]. The western ''[[Open Range]]'', which he directed and starred in, received critical acclaim in 2003, and was a surprise success commercially. He received some of his best reviews for his supporting role as retired professional baseball player Denny Davies in ''[[The Upside of Anger]]'', for which he received a nomination from the [[Broadcast Film Critics Association]] and won the [[San Francisco Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. After that, Costner starred in ''[[The Guardian (2006 film)|The Guardian]]'' and in ''[[Mr. Brooks]]'', in which he portrayed a [[serial killer]]. In 2008, Costner starred in ''[[Swing Vote (2008 film)|Swing Vote]]''. Costner was honored on September 6, 2006 when his hand and foot prints were set in concrete in front of [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] alongside those of other celebrated actors and entertainers. In 2010, he appeared in ''[[The Company Men]]'' alongside [[Ben Affleck]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and [[Chris Cooper]]. It debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], and received good reviews. It was released in cinemas worldwide in January 2011. The film was considered to be an Oscar contender, but did not get a nomination.

Costner announced that he would be returning to the director's chair for the first time in seven years in 2011 with ''A Little War of Our Own''. The film is about a local sheriff who must keep his town from erupting into violence during [[World War II]]. The other lead role is that of a German [[U-boat]] captain. The screenplay is by Dan Gordon, who co-wrote another sheriff movie for Costner, ''[[Wyatt Earp]]'' (1994). In January 2012, Costner had to admit funding did not come through, and that he still hopes to make it in 2013.
He was also about to team up again with director Kevin Reynolds in ''Learning Italian''. Costner would play a [[CIA]] agent stationed in a coastal Italian town in order to keep an eye on a [[KGB]] operative. However, the movie did not get past pre-production phase because Costner and Reynolds could not raise the money required.

He also appears, as a special cameo, in ''[[Funny or Die]]'''s "Field of Dreams 2: Lockout". Costner portrayed [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Jonathan Kent]] in the rebooted [[Superman in film#Reboot (2012)|Superman film]], ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', directed by [[Zack Snyder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/128994-kevin-costner-confirmed-for-superman|title=Kevin Costner Confirmed for Superman!|work=SuperHeroHype}}</ref> Costner was going to have a role in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Django Unchained]]'',<ref>{{cite web |last=Kit |first=Borys |date=July 18, 2011 |title=Kevin Costner to Train Slaves in 'Django Unchained' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/kevin-costner-train-slaves-django-212503 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60IUT8uPC |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |accessdate=July 19, 2011}}</ref> but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts.

Costner starred in the three-part miniseries ''[[Hatfields & McCoys (miniseries)|Hatfields and McCoys]]'', which premiered on May 28, 2012 on the [[History (TV channel)|History Channel]]. It immediately broke a record by pulling 13.9&nbsp;million viewers. The miniseries tells the true American story of a legendary family feud – one that spanned decades and nearly launched a war between [[Kentucky]] and [[West Virginia]]. The role earned Costner a 2012 [[Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pennington|first=Gail|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/television/gail-pennington/homeland-wins-big-hamm-loses-again-at-emmys/article_3db182bc-05de-11e2-b471-001a4bcf6878.html|title='Homeland' wins big; Hamm loses again at Emmys|publisher=''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' via website|date=September 24, 2012|accessdate=September 24, 2012}}</ref> He also won the Golden Globe for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.

In 2014, Costner appeared in the spy movie ''[[Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit]]'', as Thomas Harper, a mentor for the series' title character. The same year, he starred in the thriller ''[[3 Days to Kill]]'' and the drama ''[[Draft Day]]'' and produced and starred in ''[[Black or White (film)|Black or White]]''.<ref>[http://WWW.pbs.Org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/actor-kevin-costner/?show=23896 Kevin Costner interview (1/2-hour)], [[Tavis Smiley]], [[PBS]], February 3, 2015.

===Country music===
{{Main|Kevin Costner & Modern West}}
[[File:KevinCostnerJuly10.jpg|thumb|upright|Costner on stage in July 2010]]
Costner is the singer in [[Kevin Costner & Modern West]], a [[country rock]] band which he founded with the encouragement of his wife Christine. They began a worldwide tour in October 2007, which included shows in [[Istanbul]] and Rome. The group also performed at NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races at Daytona International Speedway and Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, NC.

The band released a country album, ''[[Untold Truths]]'', on November 11, 2008 on [[Universal South Records]]. The album peaked at No.&nbsp;61 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] and No.&nbsp;35 on the [[Top Heatseekers]] chart. Three singles ("Superman 14", "Long Hot Night" and "Backyard") have been released to radio, although none have charted. The single "Superman 14" has been made into a live music video.

In 2009, they went on tour with [[opening act]] [[The Alternate Routes]]. In August, at the [[Big Valley Jamboree]] in Camrose, [[Alberta]], Costner and the band were scheduled next on stage when a severe thunderstorm struck, collapsing the stage and stands on the main stage. One person was reported dead and forty injured.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/08/02/world/AP-CN-Canada-Stage-Collapse.html?_r=1 |title=1 Dead, 40 Injured in Canada Stage Collapse |publisher=[[Associated Press|AP]] via ''The New York Times'' |date=August 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 2, 2009}}</ref> Later, an auction was held to raise money for the two young sons of the woman killed.

==Other ventures==

===Baseball===
Several of Costner's films have included a baseball theme. They include ''Chasing Dreams'', ''[[Bull Durham]]'', ''[[Field of Dreams]]'', ''[[For Love of the Game (film)|For Love of the Game]]'' and ''[[The Upside of Anger]]'', in which his character is a former pro baseball player.

He has a home in [[Austin]] and sometimes appears at [[Texas Longhorns baseball]] practices and games. Costner is a close friend of Longhorns baseball coach [[Augie Garrido]] from Garrido's days coaching at [[Cal State Fullerton]], the actor's alma mater. He cast Garrido to play the role of the Yankee manager in ''For Love of the Game''. He tries to attend every [[College World Series]] game that [[CSUF Titans]] plays in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Costner walked-on for a try-out, but did not make the team early in his time at the university.

Costner was a partial owner of the [[Zion, Illinois]]-based [[Lake County Fielders]] [[Independent league baseball|independent baseball team]] in the [[North American League (baseball)|North American League]]. The Fielders name was an homage to ''Field of Dreams'', with the logo showing a ballplayer standing amid a field of corn.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rotenbirk|first=Lori|title=Major League Hopes Pinned on the Minors|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/us/05zion.html?ref=us|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 5, 2009|page=A23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Zion, IL 2010 Northern League Expansion Team Named the Lake County Fielders|url=http://www.fieldersbaseball.com/zion-il-2010-northern-league-expansion-team-named-lake-county-fielders|work=Lake County Fielders web site|accessdate=July 28, 2013|date=October 5, 2009}}</ref>

===Business interests===
In July 2004, Costner fired Francis and Carla Caneva, who managed the Midnight Star casino in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]]. A judge subsequently ordered Costner to pay a percentage of $6.1&nbsp;million to buy out the Canevas as his business partners. In October 2006, Costner asked the [[South Dakota Supreme Court]] to re-examine the ruling, as an accountant hired by the actor had determined the market value of the casino to be $3.1&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5405212.stm Costner appeals in casino wrangle], BBC</ref>

On June 6, 2004 Costner opened  "Tatanka: The Story of the Bison" one mile south of [[Deadwood, South Dakota]] on [[U.S. Route 85]], for what Kevin Costner hopes will be an educational and emotional place for people to learn about America's westward expansion. Promoters stated in a news release that the $5 million attraction has a new, 3,800-square-foot interactive interpretive center featuring exhibit, retail, and food and beverage areas, as well as offices and a small orientation theater. The visitor center features graphics, photographs and text describing how bison came to North America and how American Indian tribes used the animals for food, clothing, shelter and many other needs. Other displays show how the American westward expansion threatened the buffalo populations and how the bison herds have since recovered under managed care to number about 400,000.
The centerpiece is a bronze sculpture depicting a buffalo jump commonly used by Plains Indians to kill and process large numbers of animals on which they depended for survival. Hill City artist Peggy Detmers created 14 bronze bison in the act of running from their pursuers and three bronze Lakota riders on horseback. Three of the massive bison are posed in midair, cascading over the face of a cliff. Costner commissioned the work in 1994 from Detmers. The five-fourths-scale bronzes, each weighing between 2,500 and 8,000 pounds, were cast at Eagle Bronze Foundry in Lander, Wyo.
Another aspect is an 1845 Lakota encampment. The encampment will feature living Lakota interpreters of history, dressed in period attire and settled among their teepees.<ref>Rapid City Journal, June 6, 2004</ref>

In 1995, Costner began developing [[oil separation]] machines based on a patent he purchased from the [[US government]]. The machines developed by the company were of little commercial interest until the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], when [[BP]] took six of the machines from a company in which Costner owned an interest, Ocean Therapy Solutions, for testing in late May 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/if-you-build-it/?dbk | work=The New York Times | title=If You Build It ... | first=Liz | last=Robbins | date=May 19, 2010}}</ref> On June 16, 2010 BP entered into a lease with Ocean Therapy Solutions for 32 of the oil-water separation devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reefrelieffounders.com/drilling/2010/06/11/examiner-kevin-costner-sells-32-oil-spill-machines-to-bp-to-recycle-6-million-gallons-of-water-a-day-photos|title=Examiner: Kevin Costner sells 32 oil spill machines to BP to recycle 6 million gallons of water a day (photos)}}</ref> Although Spyron Contoguris and [[Stephen Baldwin]] previously sold their interests in Ocean Therapy Solutions in mid-June to another investor in the company, they filed a lawsuit in Louisiana District Court claiming $10.64&nbsp;million for securities fraud and misrepresentation. The suit claimed that Costner kept a meeting with BP secret from them, and the secret meeting resulted in an $18&nbsp;million down payment on a $52&nbsp;million purchase and that after the down payment but before any announcement another investor used part of the downpayment to buy out their shares, thus excluding them from their share of the profits from the total sale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news-briefs.ew.com/2010/12/23/stephen-baldwin-kevin-costner-lawsuit-bp/?hpt=T2|title=Stephen Baldwin spills lawsuit on Kevin Costner|author=Kate Ward}}</ref> The suit claimed that, despite public statements by Costner, Ocean Therapy Solutions, BP and others to the contrary, Baldwin and Contogouris were told that BP was still testing the machines and had not yet committed to lease the machines from Ocean Therapy Solutions and that the other investor in Ocean Therapy Solutions purchased their shares for $1.4&nbsp;million to Baldwin and $500,000, to Contogouris.<ref>Detroit Free Press, Friday, December 24, 2010, page 3C</ref>
In June 2012, a federal jury in Louisiana deliberated for less than 2 hours before completely rejecting Baldwin's and Contogouris' claims in the multi-million dollar oil clean-up case, and the court ordered Baldwin and Contogouris to reimburse Costner and the other defendants in the case for their costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kevin_Costner&action=edit&section=8&editintro=Template:BLP_editintro|title=Kevin Costner|accessdate=June 18, 2012}}</ref>

===Philanthropy===
