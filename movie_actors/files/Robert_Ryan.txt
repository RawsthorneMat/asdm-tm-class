'''Robert Bushnell Ryan''' (November 11, 1909{{spaced ndash}}July 11, 1973) was an American actor who often played hardened cops and ruthless villains.

==Early life and career==
Ryan was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the first child of Timothy Ryan and his wife Mabel Bushnell Ryan.<ref name="franklin jarlett">{{cite book|last=Jarlett|first=Franklin|title=Robert Ryan: A Biography and Critical Filmography|year=1997|publisher=McFarland Classics|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}</ref>{{rp|p.4}} He graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1932, having held the school's heavyweight boxing title all four years of his attendance. After graduation, the 6′&nbsp;4" Ryan found employment as a [[Fireman (steam engine)|stoker]] on a ship, a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] worker, and a ranch hand in [[Montana]].

Ryan attempted to make a career in show business as a [[playwright]], but was forced to start acting in order to support himself. He studied acting in [[Hollywood]] and appeared on stage and in small film parts during the early 1940s, beginning with ''[[The Ghost Breakers]]'' and ''[[Queen of the Mob]]'', both for [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1940.

In January 1944, after securing a contract guarantee from [[RKO Radio Pictures]], Ryan enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] and served as a [[drill instructor]] at [[Camp Pendleton]], located between [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]] and [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]] in Southern California.  At Camp Pendleton, he befriended writer and future director [[Richard Brooks]], whose novel, ''The Brick Foxhole'', he greatly admired. He also took up painting.

Ryan's breakthrough film role was as an [[anti-Semitic]] killer in ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'' (1947), a [[film noir]] based on Brooks's novel. The role won Ryan his sole career [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination, for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. From then on, Ryan's specialty was tough/tender roles, finding particular expression in the films of directors such as [[Nicholas Ray]], [[Robert Wise]] and [[Sam Fuller]]. In Ray's ''[[On Dangerous Ground]]'' (1951) he portrayed a burnt-out city cop finding redemption while solving a rural murder. In Wise's ''[[The Set-Up (1949 film)|The Set-Up]]'' (1949), he played an over-the-hill boxer who is brutally punished for refusing to take a dive. Other important films were [[Anthony Mann]]'s western ''[[The Naked Spur]]'', Sam Fuller's uproarious Japanese set gangland thriller ''[[House of Bamboo]]'', ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'', and the socially conscious heist movie ''[[Odds Against Tomorrow]]''. He also appeared in several all-star war films, including ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962) and ''[[Battle of the Bulge (film)|Battle of the Bulge]]'' (1965), and ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]''. He also played [[John the Baptist]] in [[MGM]]'s Technicolor epic ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'' (1961) and was the villainous Claggart in [[Peter Ustinov]]'s adaptation of ''[[Billy Budd (film)|Billy Budd]]'' (1962).

In his later years, Ryan continued playing significant roles in major films. Among the most notable were ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'', ''[[The Professionals (1966 film)|The Professionals]]'' (1966) and [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s highly influential brutal western ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). In his final screen appearance, as Larry Slade in the [[American Film Theatre]]'s [[The Iceman Cometh (1973 film)|1973 film]] of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s [[The Iceman Cometh]], Ryan, who died before the film's premiere, won the [[Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor]],<ref>[http://www.kcfcc.org/1970s.html KCFCC Award Winners 1970-1979].

Less than two years before, Ryan had tackled O'Neill's next - and penultimate -  play onstage, portraying [[Long Day's Journey Into Night#Characters|James Tyrone]] in [[Arvin Brown]]'s critically acclaimed [[Off-Broadway]] production of ''[[Long Day's Journey Into Night]]''.<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=%22%22Robert+Ryan%22+%22Long+Day's%22+%22Wharf%22+intitle:The+intitle:New+intitle:Yorker&num=10 "Off Broadway"].

The latter production was one of the first developed by the Plumstead Playhouse (later the Plumstead Theatre Company), a [[Long Island]]-based repertory company founded by Ryan, [[Martha Scott]] and [[Henry Fonda]];<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a6JQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u1wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5673,1649757&dq "Repertory Formed By Noted Actors"].

Ryan also played the title characters in Shakespeare's ''[[Coriolanus]]'' (1954, Off-Broadway) and ''[[Othello]]'' (1967, in [[Nottingham]], [[England]]).<ref name=UPI-AP>UPI-AP.

Ryan made his belated small screen debut in 1955 as [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the ''[[Screen Director's Playhouse]]'' adaptation of [[Christopher Morley]]'s story, "Lincoln's Doctor's Dog." As he explained to reporters, despite financial considerations, Ryan preferred to steer clear of any TV series commitment:
<blockquote>The only money in TV is in the series, and I want to stay out of those. Sure, I might make a million or so in a series, but I'd wind up being 'Sidewinder Sam' for the rest of my life.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CfkxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u-MFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5201,690558&dq=robert-ryan+lincoln's-doctor's-dog&hl=en "Notes From Hollywood"]. ''The Ottawa Citizen''. December 3, 1955. Retrieved 2013-03-15.</ref></blockquote>
Ryan would remain true to these convictions, appearing in many television series, but always as a guest star. Notable appearances include his portrayal of Franklin Hoppy-Hopp in the 1964 episode "Who Chopped Down the Cherry Tree?" on the [[NBC]] [[medical drama]] about [[psychiatry]], ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]''. Similarly, he guest starred as Lloyd Osment in the 1964 episode "Better Than a Dead Lion" in the ABC psychiatric series, ''[[Breaking Point (1963 TV series)|Breaking Point]]''. In 1964, Ryan appeared with [[Warren Oates]] in the episode "No Comment" of [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s short-lived drama about newspapers, ''[[The Reporter (TV series)|The Reporter]]'', starring [[Harry Guardino]] in the title role of [[journalist]] Danny Taylor. Ryan appeared three times (1962–1964) on the western ''[[Wagon Train]]'', four times (1956–1959) on CBS's ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater]]'' and twice (1959 and 1961) on the ''Zane Grey'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Frontier Justice (TV series)|Frontier Justice]]''. Among Ryan's many appearances on the dramatic [[anthology series]] of TV's [[Golden Age of Television|golden age]], perhaps most notable are his starring roles in ''[[Playhouse 90]]'''s production of [[The Great Gatsby]], opposite [[Jeanne Crain]], and in the ''Buick-Electra Playhouse'' adaptation of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s "[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (short story collection)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]," written by [[A.E. Hotchner]], directed by [[John Frankenheimer]], and co-starring [[Ann Todd]], [[Mary Astor]], and [[Janice Rule]].

Although Ryan never appeared in any production of Gene Roddenberry's "Star Trek", Ryan was originally considered for the role of Commodore Matt Decker in the Fall 1967 episode "[[The Doomsday Machine (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Doomsday Machine]] ".  Episode author Norman Spinrad had written the script with actor Robert Ryan in mind to play Commodore Decker, but Ryan was unavailable, owing to prior commitments.  That role subsequently went to William Windom.

==Politics==
Ryan was a [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who tirelessly supported [[civil rights]] issues. Despite his military service, he also came to share the [[pacifist]] views of his wife Jessica, who was a [[Quaker]].

In the late 1940s, as the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) intensified its anti-communist attacks on [[Hollywood]], he joined the short-lived [[Committee for the First Amendment]]. Throughout the 1950s, he donated money and services to civic and religious organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[American Friends Service Committee]], and [[United World Federalists]]. In September 1959, he and [[Steve Allen]] became founding co-chairs of [[Peace Action|The Committee for a SANE Nuclear Policy]]'s Hollywood chapter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/128119/Robert-Ryan/biography |title=Robert Ryan Biography |author= |year=2010 |work=New York Times }}</ref>

By the mid-1960s, Ryan's political activities included efforts to fight racial discrimination. He served in the cultural division of the Committee to Defend [[Martin Luther King]] and, with [[Bill Cosby]], [[Robert Culp]], [[Sidney Poitier]], and other actors, helped organize the short-lived Artists Help All Blacks.<ref name="franklin jarlett" />{{rp|p.132}}

Ryan's film work often ran counter to the political causes he embraced. He was a pacifist who starred in war movies, westerns, and violent thrillers. He was an opponent of [[McCarthyism]] who played a nefarious [[Communist]] agent in ''[[I Married a Communist (film)|I Married a Communist]]''. In socially progressive films such as ''[[Crossfire (film)|Crossfire]]'', ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'', ''[[Executive Action (film)|Executive Action]]'' and ''[[Odds Against Tomorrow]]'', he played bigoted villains. Ryan was often vocal about this dichotomy. At a screening of ''[[Odds Against Tomorrow]]'', he appeared before the press to discuss "the problems of an actor like me playing the kind of character that in real life he finds totally despicable."<ref>Philip K. Scheuer, ''Los Angeles Times,'' 1 October 1959, B13.</ref>

==Personal life==
On March 11, 1939, he married Jessica Cadwalader. They had two sons—Cheyney, a [[research fellow]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] and a Professor of Philosophy and Law at the [[University of Oregon]],  his oldest son, Walker T, a bluesman—and one daughter, Lisa. They lived in the [[Manhattan]] [[Housing cooperative|co-op]] [[The Dakota]] at 72nd and [[Central Park West]] and eventually [[Death of John Lennon|sublet the apartment]] to [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]].{{cn|date=April 2015}}

A small group of parents decided to create a school where their children could flourish as thinkers, as artists, as athletes, and most of all, as human beings.

In the fall of 1951, a progressive school by the name of Oakwood was opened in Jessica and Robert Ryan's backyard. Three years later, those pioneering parents, including the Ryans, Sidney Harmon and Elizabeth Schappert, Wendy and Ross Cabeen, and Charles and Emilie Haas bought and built the elementary school campus on Moorpark Street in Los Angeles.

Robert and Jessica remained married until her death from cancer in 1972. He died from [[lung cancer]] in [[New York City]] the following year at age 63.
