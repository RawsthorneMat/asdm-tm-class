'''Jean Arthur''' (October 17, 1900 – June 19, 1991) was an American actress and a major film star of the 1930s and 1940s.

Arthur had feature roles in three [[Frank Capra]] films: ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936), ''[[You Can't Take It With You (film)|You Can't Take It With You]]'' (1938), and ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), films that championed the "everyday heroine". Arthur was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in 1944 for her performance in ''[[The More the Merrier]]'' (1943). James Harvey wrote in his recounting of the era, "No one was more closely identified with the [[screwball comedy]] than Jean Arthur. So much was she part of it, so much was her star personality defined by it, that the screwball style itself seems almost unimaginable without her."<ref>Harvey 1987, p. 351.</ref> She has been called "the quintessential comedic leading lady".<ref>[[Robert Osborne|Osborne, Robert]]. "Dedication at 17-film salute to Jean Arthur." ''[[Turner Classic Movies]] (broadcast)'', January 2007.</ref>

Her last film performance was the memorable, and distinctly non-comedic, rancher's wife in [[George Stevens]]' ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' in 1953. To the public, Arthur was known as a reclusive woman. News magazine ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' observed in a 1940 article: "Next to [[Greta Garbo|Garbo]], Jean Arthur is Hollywood's reigning mystery woman."<ref>Oller 1997, p. 1.</ref> As well as recoiling from interviews, she avoided photographers and refused to become a part of any kind of publicity.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 2.</ref>

==Early life==
Arthur was born '''Gladys Georgianna Greene''' in [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh, New York]] to [[Protestant]] parents, Johanna Augusta Nelson and Hubert Sidney Greene. Her maternal grandparents were immigrants from [[Norway]]<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/arthur.htm "Genealogy: Jean Arthur."] ''Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com,'' August 14, 2010.</ref> who settled in the American West; she also had distant ancestors from [[England]]. She had three older brothers: Donald Hubert (1891), Robert B. (1892) and Albert Sidney (1894).<ref>1900 US Census Plattsburgh, New York and 1910 US Census, Cumberland, Maine.</ref> She lived off and on in [[Westbrook, Maine]], from 1908 to 1915 while her father worked at Lamson Studios in [[Portland, Maine]], as a photographer. The product of a nomadic childhood, Arthur also lived at times in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]; [[Schenectady, New York]]; [[Saranac Lake, New York]]; and, during a portion of her high school years, in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood&nbsp;– at 573 West 159th Street&nbsp;– of upper [[Manhattan]]. The family's relocation to New York City occurred in 1915, where Arthur dropped out of high school in her junior year due to a "change in family circumstances".<ref name="Oller 1997, p. 34">Oller 1997, p. 34.</ref>

Presaging many of her later film roles, she worked as a stenographer on Bond Street in lower [[Manhattan]] during [[World War I]]. Both her father (at age 55, claiming to be 45) and siblings enlisted in the war, after which her brother Albert died as a result of injuries sustained in battle.

==Film career==

===Silent film career===
{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=right|width=25%|quote="It would have been better business if I cried in front of the producers. It isn't a bad idea to get angry and chew up the scenery. I've had to learn to be a different person since I've been out here. Anybody that sticks it out in Hollywood for four years is bound to change in self-defense... Oh, I'm hard-boiled now. I don't expect anything. But it took me a long time to get over hoping, and believing, people's promises. That's the worst of this business, everyone is such a good promisor."<ref>Oller 1997, p. 46.</ref>|source=—Arthur commenting on her unsuccessful film career in 1928.}}
Discovered by [[Fox Film|Fox Film Studios]] while she was doing commercial modeling in New York City in the early 1920s, Arthur landed a one-year contract and debuted in the [[silent film]] ''[[Cameo Kirby]]'' (1923), directed by [[John Ford]]. She reputedly took her stage name from two of her greatest heroes, [[Joan of Arc]] (Jeanne d'Arc) and [[King Arthur]]. The studio was at the time looking for new American sweethearts with sufficient sex appeal to interest the [[Jazz Age]] audiences. Arthur was remodeled as such a personality, a [[flapper]].<ref>Oller 1997, p. 40.</ref> Following the small role in ''Cameo Kirby'', she received her first female lead role in ''The Temple of Venus'' (1923), a plotless tale about a group of dancing nymphs. Dissatisfied with her lack of acting talent, the film's director [[Henry Otto]] replaced Arthur with actress [[Mary Philbin]] during the third day of shooting. Arthur agreed with the director: "There wasn't a spark from within. I was acting like a mechanical doll personality. I thought I was disgraced for life."<ref>Oller 1997, p. 41.</ref> She was planning on leaving the California film industry for good, but reluctantly stayed due to her contract, and appeared in comedy shorts instead. Despite lacking the required talent, Arthur liked acting, which she perceived as an "outlet". To acquire some fame, she registered herself as a photo player in the Los Angeles city directory, as well as appearing in a promotional film for a new Encino nightclub, but to no avail.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 42.</ref>

Change came when one day she showed up at the lot of Action Pictures, which produced [[B movie|B westerns]], and impressed its owner Lester F. Scott, Jr., with her presence. He decided to take a chance on a complete unknown, and she was cast in over twenty westerns in a two-year period. Only receiving $25 a picture, Arthur suffered from difficult working conditions: "The films were generally shot on location, often in the desert near Los Angeles, under a scorching sun that caused throats to parch and make-up to run. Running water was nowhere to be found, and even outhouses were a luxury not always present. The extras on these films were often real cowboys, tough men who were used to roughing it and who had little use for those who were not."<ref>Oller 1997, p. 43.</ref> The films were moderately successful in second-rate Midwestern theaters, though Arthur received no official attention. Aside from appearing in films for Action Pictures between 1924 and 1926, she appeared in some independent westerns including ''The Drug Store Cowboy'' (1925), and westerns for [[Poverty Row]], as well as having an uncredited bit part in [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Seven Chances]]'' (1925).

[[File:Jean Arthur - Smith.JPG|thumb|Publicity photo, c. 1939]]
In 1927, Arthur attracted more attention when she appeared opposite [[Mae Busch]] and [[Charles Delaney]] as a gold digging chorus girl in ''[[Husband Hunters]]''. Subsequently, she was romanced by actor [[Monty Banks]] in ''Horse Shoes'' (1927), both a commercial and critical success. She was cast on Banks' insistence, and received a salary of $700.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 45.</ref> Next, director [[Richard Wallace (director)|Richard Wallace]] ignored Fox's wishes to cast a more experienced actress by assigning Arthur to the female lead in ''The Poor Nut'' (1927), a college comedy which gave her wide exposure to audiences. A reviewer for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' did not spare the actress in his review: "With everyone in Hollywood bragging about the tremendous overflow of charming young women all battering upon the directorial doors leading to an appearance in pictures, it seems strange that from all these should have been selected two flat specimens such as Jean Arthur and [[Jane Winton]]. Neither of the girls has screen presence. Even under the kindliest treatment from the camera they are far from attractive and in one or two side shots almost impossible."<ref>Oller 1997, pp. 45–46.</ref> Fed up with the direction that her career was taking, Arthur expressed her desire for a big break in an interview at the time. She was skeptical when signed to a small role in ''[[Warming Up (1928 film)|Warming Up]]'' (1928), a film produced for a big studio, [[Famous Players-Lasky]], and starring [[Richard Dix]]. Promoted as the studio's first [[sound film]], it received wide media attention, and Arthur earned praise for her portrayal of a club owner's daughter. ''Variety'' opined, "Dix and Arthur are splendid in spite of the wretched material", while ''[[Screenland]]'' wrote that Arthur "is one of the most charming young kissees who ever officiated in a Dix film. Jean is winsome; she neither looks nor acts like the regular movie heroine. She's a nice girl&nbsp;– but she has her moments."<ref>Oller 1997, p. 47.</ref> The success of ''Warming Up'' resulted in Arthur being signed to a three-year contract with the studio, soon to be known as [[Paramount Pictures]], and receiving $150 a week.

===Transition to sound film===
With the rise of the [[talkies]] in the late 1920s, Arthur was among the many silent screen actors of Paramount Pictures initially unwilling to adapt to sound films.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 51.</ref> Upon realizing that the craze for sound films was not a phase, she met with sound coach Roy Pomeroy. It was her distinctive, throaty voice&nbsp;– in addition to some stage training on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the early 1930s&nbsp;– that eventually helped make her a star in the talkies. However, it initially prevented directors from casting her in films.<ref name="fivtyeight" /> In her early talkies, this "throaty" voice is still missing, and it remains unclear whether it has not yet emerged or whether she hid it.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 52.</ref> Her all-talking film debut was ''[[The Canary Murder Case (film)|The Canary Murder Case]]'' (1929), in which she co-starred opposite [[William Powell]] and [[Louise Brooks]]. Arthur only impressed a few with the film and later claimed that at the time she was a "very poor actress ... awfully anxious to improve, but ... inexperienced so far as genuine training was concerned."<ref>Oller 1997, p. 53.</ref>

[[Image:Jean Arthur in Only Angels Have Wings trailer.JPG|200px|left|thumb|''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (1939)]]
In the early years of talking pictures, Paramount was known for contracting Broadway actors with experienced vocals and impressive background references. Arthur was not among these actors, and she struggled for recognition in the film industry. Her personal involvement with rising Paramount executive [[David O. Selznick]]&nbsp;– despite his relationship with [[Irene Mayer Selznick]]&nbsp;– proved substantial; she was put on the map and became selected as one of the [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]] in 1929. Following a silent B-western called ''[[Stairs of Sand]]'' (1929), she received some positive notices when she played the female lead in the lavish production of ''[[The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu]]'' (1929).<ref name="fivtyeight">Oller 1997, p. 58.</ref> Arthur was given more publicity assignments, which she carried out, even though she immediately disliked posing for photographers and giving interviews.<ref name="fivtyeight"/>

Through Selznick, Arthur received her "best role to date" opposite famous sex symbol [[Clara Bow]] in the early sound film ''[[The Saturday Night Kid]]'' (1929).<ref>Oller 1997, p. 60.</ref> Of the two female leads, Arthur was thought to have "the better part", and director Edward Sutherland claimed that "Arthur was so good that we had to cut and cut to keep her from stealing the picture" from Bow.<ref name="runninwild">Stenn 1988, p. 178.</ref> While some argued that Bow resented Arthur for having the "better part",<ref name="sixtyone">Oller 1997, p. 61.</ref> Bow encouraged Arthur to make the most of the production.<ref name="runninwild"/> Arthur later praised her working experience with Bow: "[Bow] was so generous, no snootiness or anything. She was wonderful to me."<ref>Stenn 1988, p. 179.</ref> The film was a moderate success, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the film would have been "merely commonplace, were it not for Jean Arthur, who plays the catty sister with a great deal of skill."<ref name="sixtyone"/>

Following a role in ''Halfway to Heaven'' (1929) opposite popular actor [[Charles Rogers (actor)|Charles Rogers]] (of which ''Variety'' opined that her career could be heading somewhere if she acquired more sex appeal),<ref name="sixtyone" /> Selznick assigned her to play [[William Powell]]'s wife in ''Street of Chance'' (1930). She did not impress the film's director [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]], who advised the actress to move back to New York because she would not make it in Hollywood.<ref name="sixtyone"/> By 1930, her relationship with Selznick had ended, causing her career at Paramount to slip.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 62.</ref> Following a string of "lifeless ingenue roles" in mediocre films, she debuted on stage in December 1930 with a supporting role in [[Pasadena Playhouse]]'s ten-day run production of ''Spring Song''. Back in Hollywood, Arthur saw her career deteriorating, and she dyed her hair blonde in an attempt to boost her image and avoid comparison with more successful actress [[Mary Brian]].<ref name="sixtyfour">Oller 1997, p. 64.</ref> Her effort did not pay off: when her three-year contract at Paramount expired in mid-1931, she was given her release with an announcement from Paramount that the decision was due to financial setbacks caused by the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="sixtyfour"/>

===Broadway and Columbia Pictures===

In late 1931, Arthur returned to New York City, where a Broadway agent cast Arthur in an adaptation of ''[[Lysistrata]]'', which opened at the Riviera Theater on January 24, 1932. A few months later, she made her Broadway debut in ''Foreign Affairs'' opposite [[Dorothy Gish]] and [[Osgood Perkins]]. Even though the play did not fare well and closed after twenty-three performances, critics were impressed by her work on stage.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 69.</ref> She next won the female lead in ''The Man Who Reclaimed His Head'', which opened on September 8, 1932, at the Broadhurst Theatre to mostly mixed notices for Arthur, and negative reviews for the play caused the production to be halted quickly.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 70.</ref> Arthur returned to California for the holidays, and appeared in the [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] film ''[[The Past of Mary Holmes]]'' (1933), her first film in two years.

Back on Broadway, Arthur continued to appear in small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, continued to praise her in their reviews. It has been argued that in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time.<ref name="seventyone">Oller 1997, p. 71.</ref> On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:<blockquote>I don't think Hollywood is the place to be yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director encouraged me and I learned how to be myself. [..] I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.<ref name="seventyone" /></blockquote>

[[File:Jean Arthur - 1942.JPG|thumb|left|In ''The Talk of the Town'' (1942)]]
''The Curtain Rises'', which ran from October to December 1933, was Arthur's first Broadway play in which she was the center of attention.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 72.</ref> With an improved résumé, she returned to Hollywood in late 1933, and turned down several contract offers until she was asked to meet with an executive from [[Columbia Pictures]].<ref name="seventythree">Oller 1997, p. 73.</ref> Arthur agreed to star in a film, ''Whirlpool'' (1934), and during production she was offered a long-term contract that promised financial stability for both her and her parents.<ref name="seventythree" /> Even though hesitant to give up her stage career, Arthur signed the five-year contract on February 14, 1934.<ref name="Oller 1997, p. 34"/>

In 1935, at age 34, Arthur starred opposite [[Edward G. Robinson]] in the gangster farce ''[[The Whole Town's Talking]]'', also directed by Ford, and her popularity began to rise. It was the first time Arthur portrayed a hard-boiled working girl with a heart of gold, the type of role she would be associated with for the rest of her career.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 81.</ref> She enjoyed the acting experience and working opposite Robinson, who remarked in his biography that it was a "delight to work with and know" Arthur.<ref name="eightytwo">Oller 1997, p. 82.</ref> By the time of the film's release, her hair, naturally brunette throughout the silent film portion of her career, was bleached blonde and would stay that way. She was known for maneuvering to be photographed and filmed almost exclusively from the left; Arthur felt that her left was her best side, and worked hard to keep it in the fore. Director [[Frank Capra]] recalled producer [[Harry Cohn]]'s description of Jean Arthur's imbalanced profile: "half of it's angel, and the other half horse."<ref name="Capra p. 184">Capra 1971, p. 184.</ref> Her next few films, ''[[Party Wire]]'' (1935), ''[[Public Hero No. 1]]'' (1935) and ''[[If You Could Only Cook]]'' (1935), did not match the success of ''The Whole Town's Talking'', but they all brought the actress positive reviews.<ref name="eightytwo" /> In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', critic Andre Sennwald praised Arthur's performance in ''Public Hero No. 1'', writing that she "is as refreshing a change from the routine it-girl as [[Joseph Calleia]] is in his own department."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2383/Public-Hero-No-1/articles.html |title=Read TCM's article on Public Hero No. 1 |accessdate=2012-11-16|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> Another critic wrote of her performance in ''If You Could Only Cook'' that "[she is] outstanding as she effortlessly slips from charming comedienne to beautiful romantic."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/78966/If-You-Could-Only-Cook/articles.html |title=Read TCM's article on If You Could Only Cook |accessdate=2012-11-16|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> With her now apparent rise to fame, Arthur was able to extract several contractual concessions from Harry Cohn, such as script and director approval and the right to make films for other studios.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 83.</ref>

The turning point in Arthur's career came when she was chosen by Frank Capra to star in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]''. Capra had spotted her in a daily rush<ref name="Capra p. 184"/> from the film ''Whirlpool'' in 1934<ref>Oller 1997, p. 84.</ref> and convinced Cohn to have [[Columbia Studios]] sign her for his next film as a tough newspaperwoman who falls in love with a country bumpkin millionaire. Even though several colleagues later recalled that Arthur was troubled by extreme stage fright during production, ''Mr. Deeds'' was critically acclaimed and propelled her to international stardom.<ref>Oller 1997, p. 85-86.</ref> In 1936 alone, she earned $119,000, more than the President of the United States and baseball player [[Lou Gehrig]].<ref>Oller 1997, p. 89.</ref> With fame also came media attention, something Arthur greatly disliked. She did not attend any social gatherings, such as formal parties in Hollywood, and acted difficult when having to work with an interviewer. She was named the American [[Greta Garbo]] - who was also known for her reclusive life - and magazine ''Movie Classic'' wrote of her in 1937: "With Garbo talking right out loud in interviews, receiving the press and even welcoming an occasional chance to say her say in the public prints, the palm for elusiveness among screen stars now goes to Jean Arthur."<ref>Oller 1997, p. 92.</ref>

Arthur's next film was ''[[The Ex-Mrs. Bradford]]'' (1936), on loan to [[RKO Pictures]], in which she starred opposite [[William Powell]] on his insistence,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2551/The-Ex-Mrs-Bradford/notes.html |title=Notes for The Ex-Mrs. Bradford |accessdate=2012-11-19|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}</ref> and hoped to take a long vacation afterwards. Cohn, however, rushed her into two more productions, ''[[Adventure in Manhattan]]'' (1936) and ''[[More Than a Secretary]]'' (1936). Neither film attracted much attention.<ref name="ninetythree">Oller 1997, p. 93.</ref> Next, again without pause, she was re-teamed with Cooper, playing [[Calamity Jane]] in [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Plainsman]]'' (1936) on another loan, this time for [[Paramount Pictures]]. Arthur, who was De Mille's second choice after [[Mae West]], described Calamity Jane as her favorite role thus far.<ref name="ninetythree" /> Afterwards, she appeared as a working girl, her typical role, in [[Mitchell Leisen]]'s screwball comedy, ''[[Easy Living (1937 film)|Easy Living]]'' (1937), with [[Ray Milland]]. She followed this with another screwball comedy, Capra's ''[[You Can't Take It With You]]'', which teamed her with [[James Stewart]].

So strong was her box office appeal by now that she was one of four finalists for the role of [[Scarlett O'Hara]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939). The film's producer, [[David O. Selznick]], had briefly romanced Arthur in the late 1920s when they both were with [[Paramount Pictures]]. Arthur re-united with director Frank Capra and Stewart for ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939), with Arthur cast once again as a working woman, this time one who teaches the naive Mr. Smith the ways of Washington, D.C.

Arthur continued to star in films such as [[Howard Hawks]]' ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'' (also 1939), with love interest [[Cary Grant]], ''[[The Talk of the Town (1942 film)|The Talk of the Town]]'' (1942), directed by [[George Stevens]] (also with Grant), and again for Stevens as a government clerk in ''[[The More the Merrier]]'' (1943), for which Arthur was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] (losing to [[Jennifer Jones (actor)|Jennifer Jones]] for ''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]''). As a result of being in dispute with studio boss [[Harry Cohn]], her fee for ''The Talk of the Town'' (1942) was only $50,000, while her male co-stars Grant and [[Ronald Colman]] received upwards of $100,000 each. Arthur remained Columbia's top star until the mid-1940s, when she left the studio, and [[Rita Hayworth]] took over as the studio's biggest name. Stevens famously called her "one of the greatest comediennes the screen has ever seen", while Capra credited her as "my favorite actress."<ref>Capra 1971, pp. 184–185.</ref>

===Later career===
[[Image:Jean Arthur in Shane.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Alan Ladd and Jean Arthur in ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953)]]
Arthur retired when her contract with [[Columbia Pictures]] expired in 1944. She reportedly ran through the studio's streets, shouting "I'm free, I'm free!" For the next several years, she turned down virtually all film offers, the two exceptions being [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[A Foreign Affair]]'' (1948), in which she played a congresswoman and rival of [[Marlene Dietrich]], and as a homesteader's wife in the classic Western ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), which turned out to be the biggest box-office hit of her career. The latter was her final film, and the only color film in which she appeared.<ref>Anthony, Elizabeth. [http://www.reelclassics.com/Actresses/Arthur/arthur2.htm "Jean Arthur at Screen Classics."] ''Reelclassics.com,'' July 21, 2010. Retrieved: August 14, 2010.</ref>

Arthur's post-retirement work in theater was intermittent, somewhat curtailed by her unease and discomfort about working in public.<ref>[http://tcmdb.com/participant/participant.jsp?participantId=6045 "TCM Movie Database: Jean Arthur."] ''Tcmdb.com,'' August 14, 2010.</ref> Capra claimed she vomited in her dressing room between scenes, yet emerged each time to perform a flawless take. According to John Oller's biography, ''Jean Arthur: The Actress Nobody Knew'' (1997), Arthur developed a kind of [[stage fright]] punctuated with bouts of [[psychosomatic illness]]es. A prime example was in 1945, when she was cast in the lead of the [[Garson Kanin]] play, ''[[Born Yesterday]]''. Her nerves and insecurity got the better of her and she left the production before it reached Broadway, opening the door for a then-unknown [[Judy Holliday]] to take the part.

She did score a major triumph on Broadway in 1950, starring in an adaptation of ''[[Peter Pan (1950 musical)|Peter Pan]]'' playing the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up when she was almost 50. She tackled the role of her namesake, [[Joan of Arc]], in a 1954 stage production of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', but she left the play after a [[nervous breakdown]] and battles with director [[Harold Clurman]].

==Retirement==

After ''Shane'' and the Broadway play ''Joan of Arc'', Arthur went into retirement for 12 years.  In 1965, she returned to show business in an episode of ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.   In 1966, the extremely reclusive Arthur took on the role of Patricia Marshall, an [[Lawyer|attorney]], on her own television sitcom, ''[[The Jean Arthur Show]]'', which was canceled mid-season by [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] after only 12 episodes. [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]] played her son, attorney Paul Marshall.

In 1967, Arthur was coaxed back to Broadway to appear as a midwestern [[spinster]] who falls in with a group of [[hippie]]s in the play ''[[The Freaking Out of Stephanie Blake]]''.  In his book ''The Season ''[[William Goldman]] reconstructed the disastrous production, which eventually closed during previews when Arthur refused to go on.

Arthur next decided to teach drama, first at [[Vassar College]] and then the [[North Carolina School of the Arts]]. While teaching at Vassar, she stopped a rather stridently overacted scene performance and directed the students' attention to a large tree growing outside the window of the performance space, advising the students on the art of naturalistic acting: "I wish people knew how to be people as well as that tree knows how to be a tree."

Her students at Vassar included the young [[Meryl Streep]]. Arthur recognized Streep's talent and potential very early on and after watching her performance in a Vassar play, Arthur said it was "like watching a movie star."

While living in North Carolina, Arthur made front-page news by being arrested and jailed for [[trespassing]] on a neighbor's property to console a dog she felt was being mistreated. An animal lover her entire life, Arthur said she trusted them more than people. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Arthur turned down the role of the female missionary in ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1973), the unsuccessful musical remake of the 1937 Frank Capra film of the same name. Then, in 1975, the Broadway play ''[[First Monday in October]]'', about the first woman to be a [[Supreme Court]] justice, was written especially with Arthur in mind, but once again she succumbed to extreme stage fright and quit the production shortly into its out-of-town run after leaving the [[Cleveland Play House]]. The play went on with [[Jane Alexander]] playing the role intended for Arthur.<ref>[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=3791 "First Monday in October."] ''ibdb.com.'' Retrieved: January 5, 2012.</ref>

After the ''First Monday in October'' incident, Arthur then retired for good, retreating to her oceanside home in [[Carmel, California]], steadfastly refusing interviews until her resistance was broken down by the author of a book about Capra. Arthur once famously said that she would rather have her throat slit than do an interview.<ref>Parish 2002, p. 92.</ref>

==Legacy==
Upon her death, film reviewer [[Charles Champlin]] wrote the following in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'':
{{quote|To at least one teenager in a small town (though I’m sure we were a multitude), Jean Arthur suggested strongly that the ideal woman could be&nbsp;– ought to be&nbsp;– judged by her spirit as well as her beauty … The notion of the woman as a friend and confidante, as well as someone you courted and were nuts about, someone whose true beauty was internal rather than external, became a full-blown possibility as we watched Jean Arthur.<ref name="Champlin">Champlin, Charles. [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-21/entertainment/ca-941_1_jean-arthur "An Appreciation – Jean Arthur's Legacy of Indelible Performances – Movies: The actress, who died Wednesday at 90, brought a striking beauty, a unique voice and spirit to the roles that established her fame."] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', June 20, 1991. Retrieved: September 3, 2009.</ref>}}
