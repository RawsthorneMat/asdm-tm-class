'''Friedrich Wilhelm "F. W." Murnau''' (born '''Friedrich Wilhelm Plumpe'''; December 28, 1888{{spaced ndash}}March 11, 1931) was a German film director.  Murnau was greatly influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] plays he had seen at the age of 12, and became a friend of director [[Max Reinhardt]]. During [[World War I]] he served as a company commander at the eastern front and was in the [[Luftstreitkräfte|German air force]], surviving several crashes without any severe injuries.

Arguably Murnau's best known work is his 1922 film ''[[Nosferatu]]'', an adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. Although not a commercial success due to copyright issues with Stoker's novel, the film was considered a masterpiece of Expressionist artwork. He was also known for his work with the 1924 film ''[[The Last Laugh]]'' and his [[Faust (1926 film)|interpretation]] of [[Goethe's Faust]] (1926). He later immigrated to [[Hollywood]] in 1926, where he joined the [[20th Century Fox|Fox Studio]] and made three films, including ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans|Sunrise]]'' (1927), ''[[4 Devils]]'' (1928) and ''[[City Girl (1930 film)|City Girl]]'' (1930).

In 1931 Murnau travelled to [[Bora Bora]] to make the film ''[[Tabu (1931 film)|Tabu]]'' with [[documentary film]] pioneer [[Robert J. Flaherty]], who left after artistic disputes with Murnau, who had to finish the movie on his own. A week prior to the opening of the film ''Tabu'', Murnau died in a [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] hospital from injuries he had received in an automobile accident that occurred along the Pacific Coast Highway near Rincon Beach, south of Santa Barbara.

Of the 21 films Murnau directed, 8 have been completely [[Lost film|lost]], leaving 12 surviving in their entirety. One reel of his feature ''[[Marizza|Marizza, genannt die Schmuggler-Madonna]]'' survives.

==Early years==
Murnau was born in [[Bielefeld]], [[Province of Westphalia]], and grew up in [[Kassel]] from the time he was seven.<ref name = "TCM">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/person/137578%7c50585/F-W-Murnau/|title=F.W. Murnau|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]]}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}</ref> He had two brothers, Bernhard and Robert, and two stepsisters, Ida and Anna. Murnau's mother Otilie Volbracht was the second wife of his father Heinrich Plumpe, the owner of a cloth-factory in the north-western part of Germany. Their villa was often turned into a stage for little plays, directed by Murnau, who already read books of [[Schopenhauer]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Shakespeare]] and [[Ibsen]] plays at the age of 12.<ref name = "Internet Trash">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050324003532/http://internettrash.com/users/murnau/murneng.htm|title=Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|publisher=internettrash.com}} Archived from March 24, 2005.</ref><ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=Vv3ZAAAAMAAJ&q=Ottilie+Volbracht+Heinrich+Plumpe&dq=Ottilie+Volbracht+Heinrich+Plumpe&hl=en]</ref> He took the name "Murnau" from the town of [[Murnau am Staffelsee]]. The 6'11" (210&nbsp;cm) director was said to have an icy, imperious disposition and an obsession with film.<ref>F.W. Murnau. Eisner, Lotte H. (1964). Le Terrain Vague. ASIN: B0029LAF1M</ref> He was openly gay.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jan/26/culture.features2 | title=A bloody disgrace | publisher=Guardian | date=26 January 2001 | accessdate=19 June 2014 | author=Atkinson, Michael}}</ref>

Murnau studied [[philology]] at the University in [[Berlin]] and later art-history and literature in [[Heidelberg]], where director [[Max Reinhardt]] saw him at a students' performance and decided to invite him to his actor-school. He soon became a friend of [[Franz Marc]], [[Else Lasker-Schüler]] and [[Hans Ehrenbaum-Degele]]. In [[World War I]] Murnau served as a company commander at the eastern front.<ref name = "Internet Trash"/> Murnau joined the [[Luftstreitkräfte|German air force]] in northern France two years later and survived eight crashes without severe injuries. He landed in [[Switzerland]] where he was interned and won a prize for the best production-concept.

==Career==
After World War I ended, Murnau returned to Germany where he soon established his own film studio with actor [[Conrad Veidt]]. His first feature-length film, The Boy in Blue, a drama inspired by the famous Thomas Gainsborough painting, was released in 1919. He explored the popular theme of dual personalities, much like [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], in 1920's ''[[The Head of Janus|Der Janus-Kopf]]'' starring Veidt and [[Bela Lugosi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/f-w-murnau--20717047?page=1|title=F.

[[File:F W Murnau 01.jpg|thumb|left|F.W. Murnau shooting a film in 1920.]]
Murnau's most famous film is ''[[Nosferatu]]'', a 1922 adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' for which Stoker's widow sued for [[copyright infringement]]. Murnau lost the lawsuit and all prints of the film were ordered to be destroyed, but bootleg prints survived. [[Count Orlok|The vampire]], played by German stage actor [[Max Schreck]], resembled a rat which was known to carry the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. The origins of the word are from Stoker's novel, where it is used by the [[Romanian people|Romanian]] townsfolk to refer to [[Count Dracula]] and presumably, other [[undead]].

Nearly as important as ''Nosferatu'' in Murnau's filmography was ''[[The Last Laugh]]'' ("Der Letzte Mann", German "The Last Man") (1924), written by [[Carl Mayer]] (a very prominent figure of the ''[[Kammerspielfilm]]'' movement) and starring [[Emil Jannings]]. The film introduced the subjective point of view camera, where the camera "sees" from the eyes of a character and uses visual style to convey a character's psychological state. It also anticipated the [[cinéma vérité]] movement in its subject matter. The film also used the "[[unchained camera technique]]", a mix of tracking shots, [[pan shot|pans]], tilts, and dolly moves.  Also, unlike the majority of Murnau's other works, ''The Last Laugh'' is considered a ''Kammerspielfilm'' with Expressionist elements. Unlike expressionist films, ''Kammerspielfilme'' are categorized by their [[chamber play]] influence, involving a lack of intricate set designs and story lines / themes regarding social injustice towards the [[working class]]es.

Murnau's last German film was the big budget ''[[Faust (1926 film)|Faust]]'' (1926) with [[Gösta Ekman (senior)|Gösta Ekman]] as the [[Faust|title character]], [[Emil Jannings]] as [[Mephistopheles|Mephisto]] and [[Camilla Horn]] as Gretchen. Murnau's film draws on older traditions of the legendary tale of [[Faust]] as well as on [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s [[Goethe's Faust|classic version]]. The film is well known for a sequence in which the giant, winged figure of Mephisto hovers over a town sowing the seeds of plague.

''Nosferatu'' (music by [[Hans Erdmann]]) and ''Faust'' (music by [[Werner R. Heymann]]) were two of the first films to feature original [[film score]]s.

==Hollywood==
[[File:Matisse Murnau Tahiti 1930.jpg|thumb|''F.W. Murnau'' with [[Henri Matisse]] at [[Tahiti]] in 1930.]]
Murnau immigrated to [[Hollywood]] in 1926, where he joined the [[20th Century Fox|Fox Studio]] and made ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' (1927), a movie often cited by film scholars as one of the greatest films of all time.<ref>[http://us.share.geocities.com/toddmagos/polls22.htm http://us.share.geocities.com/toddmagos/polls22.htm]{{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=AnomieBOT}} MASTER LIST<!-- bot-generated title -->]{{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=AnomieBOT}} at us.share.geocities.com</ref> Released in the Fox [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] [[sound-on-film]] system (music and sound effects only), ''Sunrise'' was not a financial success, but received several [[Academy award|Oscars]] at the very first [[Academy Awards]] ceremony in 1929. In winning the [[Academy Award for Unique and Artistic Production]] it shared what is now the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] award with the movie ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]''.

Murnau's next two films, the (now lost) ''[[4 Devils]]'' (1928) and ''[[City Girl (1930 film)|City Girl]]'' (1930), were modified to adapt to the new era of [[sound film]] and were not well received. Their poor receptions disillusioned Murnau, and he quit Fox to journey for a while in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].<ref name = "TCM"/>

Together with [[documentary film]] pioneer [[Robert J. Flaherty]], Murnau travelled to [[Bora Bora]] to make the film ''[[Tabu (1931 film)|Tabu]]'' in 1931. Flaherty left after artistic disputes with Murnau who had to finish the movie on his own. The movie was censored in the [[United States]] for images of bare-breasted [[Polynesia]]n women.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The film was originally shot  by cinematographer [[Floyd Crosby]] as half-talkie, half-silent, before being fully restored as a silent film — Murnau's preferred medium.

==Death==

A week prior to the opening of the film ''Tabu'', Murnau drove up the coast from [[Los Angeles, California]] in a hired Rolls Royce. The young driver, a 14-year-old Filippino servant,<ref name = "Bio on Nosferatumovie.com">[http://www.nosferatumovie.com/murnau.html Friederich Wilhelm Murnau]. Nosferatumovie.com. Accessed from August 8, 2012.</ref> crashed the car against an electric pole.

Murnau was entombed in Southwest Cemetery in [[Stahnsdorf]] (Südwest-Kirchhof Stahnsdorf) near [[Berlin]]. Only 11&nbsp;people attended the funeral. Among them were [[Robert J. Flaherty]], [[Emil Jannings]], [[Greta Garbo]]  and [[Fritz Lang]], who delivered the eulogy. Garbo also commissioned a [[death mask]] of Murnau, which she kept on her desk during her years in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eisner|first=Lotte H. |title=Murnau|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02425-0|page=222|accessdate=13 July 2010}}</ref>

==Derivative works==
In 2000, director [[E. Elias Merhige]] released ''[[Shadow of the Vampire]]'', a fictionalization of the making of ''Nosferatu''. Murnau is portrayed by [[John Malkovich]]. In the film, Murnau is so dedicated to making the film genuine that he actually hires a real [[vampire]] ([[Willem Dafoe]]) to play Count Orlok.
