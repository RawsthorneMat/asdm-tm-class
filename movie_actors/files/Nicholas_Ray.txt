'''Nicholas Ray''' (August 7, 1911 – June 16, 1979) was an American [[film director]] best known for the movie ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]].''

Ray is also appreciated by a smaller audience of [[cinephilia|cinephiles]] for a large number of [[fictional film|narrative]] [[feature film|features]] produced between 1947 and 1963 including ''[[Bigger Than Life]]'', ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', ''[[They Live by Night]]'', and ''[[In a Lonely Place]]'', as well as an [[experimental film|experimental]] work produced throughout the 1970s titled ''[[We Can't Go Home Again]]'', which was unfinished at the time of Ray's death from [[lung cancer]]. Ray's [[composition (visual arts)|compositions]] within the [[CinemaScope]] frame and use of [[color]] are particularly well-regarded. Ray was an important influence on the [[French New Wave]], with [[Jean-Luc Godard]] famously writing in a review of ''[[Bitter Victory]]'', "cinema is Nicholas Ray."

==Early life and career==
He was born '''Raymond Nicholas Kienzle''' in [[Galesville, Wisconsin]], the son of Carla Maria Carolina Sophie (Singenberger) and Raymond Joseph Kienzle.<ref>http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6896636</ref> He grew up in [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]; his grandparents were German.<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nicholas-Ray-Glorious-American-Director/dp/0060731389/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1384142980&sr=1-1&keywords=nicholas+ray Nicholas Ray:The Glorious Failure of an American Director] Page 3, Published 2012.</ref> A popular but erratic student prone to delinquency and [[alcohol abuse]], Ray spent much of his adolescence with his older sister in [[Chicago, Illinois]], where he immersed himself in the [[Al Capone]]-era nightlife and attended Waller High School. Upon his return to La Crosse in his senior year of high school, he emerged as a talented orator (winning a contest at local radio station WKBH that included a modest scholarship to "any university in the world") and gravitated toward hanging around a local stock theater. With strong grades in English & [[public speaking]] and failures in [[Latin]], [[physics]], and [[geometry]], he graduated at the bottom (ranked 152nd in a class of 153) of his class at La Crosse Central High School in 1929. He studied drama at La Crosse State Teachers College (now the [[University of Wisconsin–La Crosse]]) for two years before earning the requisite grades to matriculate at the [[University of Chicago]] in the fall of 1931. Although he only spent one semester at the institution due to excessive drinking and poor grades, Ray managed to cultivate relationships with [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and dramatist [[Thornton Wilder]], then a professor.
Ray received a [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin Fellowship]] from Wright to study under him as an apprentice.<ref name="essential cinema">{{cite book

Ray directed his first and only [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, the [[Duke Ellington]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Beggar's Holiday]]'', in 1946. One year later, he directed his first film, ''[[They Live by Night]]''. It wasn't released for two years because of the chaotic conditions surrounding [[Howard Hughes]]' takeover of [[RKO Pictures]]. An almost impressionistic take on [[film noir]], it was notable for its extreme empathy for society’s young outsiders (a recurring motif in Ray's films). Its subject matter, two young lovers running from the law, had an influence on the sporadically popular movie subgenre often called "love on the run". (Other examples are ''[[Gun Crazy]]'', ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'', and  [[Robert Altman]]’s 1974 retelling of the novel used for''They Live by Night'', ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]''.)

The ''[[New York Times]]'' gave the film a positive review (despite calling Ray's trademark sympathetic eye to rebels and criminals "misguided") and acclaimed Ray for "good, realistic production and sharp direction...Mr. Ray has an eye for action details. His staging of the robbery of a bank, all seen by the lad in the pick-up car, makes a fine clip of agitating film. And his sensitive juxtaposing of his actors against highways, tourist camps and bleak motels makes for a vivid comprehension of an intimate personal drama in hopeless flight."<ref>Crowther, Bosley. "They Live by Night" New York Times November 4, 1949</ref>

Ray made several more contributions to film noir, most notably the 1950 [[Humphrey Bogart]] movie ''[[In a Lonely Place]]'', about a troubled screenwriter, and ''[[On Dangerous Ground]]'', a police thriller.

Other minor noir films he directed in this period were ''[[Born to Be Bad (1950 film)|Born to Be Bad]]'' and ''[[A Woman's Secret]]''.

Ray's most productive and successful period was the 1950s. In the mid-fifties he made the two films for which he is best remembered: ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954)  and ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955). The former was a [[Western (genre)|Western]] starring [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Mercedes McCambridge]] in action roles of the kind customarily played by men. Highly eccentric in its time, it was much loved by [[French people|French]] critics.  ([[François Truffaut]] called it "the beauty and the beast" of the western). In 1955, Ray directed ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', starring [[James Dean]] in what proved to be his most famous role. When ''Rebel'' was released, soon after Dean's early death in an automobile crash, it had a revolutionary impact on movie-making and youth culture, virtually giving birth to the contemporary concept of the American teenager. Looking past its social and pop-culture significance, ''Rebel Without a Cause'' is the purest example of Ray’s cinematic style and vision, with an expressionistic use of colour, dramatic use of [[architecture]],  and an [[empathy]] for social misfits.

''Rebel Without a Cause'' was Ray's biggest commercial success, and marked a breakthrough in the careers of child actors [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Sal Mineo]]. Ray engaged in a tempestuous "spiritual marriage" with Dean, and awakened the latent [[homosexuality]] of Mineo, through his role as Plato, who would become the first gay teenager to appear on film. During filming it was rumored that Ray began a short-lived affair with Wood, who at age 16 was 27 years his junior. This created a tense atmosphere between Ray and [[Dennis Hopper]], who was also involved with Wood at the time, but they were reconciled later.

In 1956, Ray directed the [[melodrama]] ''[[Bigger Than Life]]'' starring [[James Mason]] as a small-town school teacher driven insane by the misuse of a new wonder-drug, [[Cortisone]]. In 1957, he directed ''[[The True Story of Jesse James]]'', which was supposed to have featured Dean but starred [[Robert Wagner]] instead.<ref name="nysun">{{cite news

==Later life==
Biographers state that Ray—who began to experiment with men during his stint at the University of Chicago— was [[Bisexuality|bisexual]];<ref name="essential cinema"/> he himself denied this in 1977, but stated that everyone has occasional fantasies or daydreams about same-sex relations.<ref>''Profile of Nicholas Ray'', 1977 TV interview on [[Criterion Collection]] DVD of ''[[Bigger Than Life]]''.</ref>

A [[drug abuse|heavy user of drugs]] and [[alcoholism|alcohol]], Ray found himself increasingly shut out of the [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] film industry in the early 1960s, though he kept on working. ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'' (1961) is now recognized as a classic. After collapsing on the set of ''[[55 Days at Peking]]'' (1963), he did not direct again until the mid-1970s.

In 1970 at a [[Grateful Dead]] concert at the [[Fillmore East]], Ray ran into Dennis Hopper, who asked Ray to join him at his ranch in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he was editing his new film, ''[[The Last Movie]]''. Hopper helped Ray secure a position at Harpur College of Arts and Sciences at [[Binghamton University]] in upstate New York.<ref name="live fast"/> From 1971 to 1973, Ray taught filmmaking where he and his students produced ''[[We Can't Go Home Again]]'', an autobiographical film employing multiple superimpositions. In the spring of 1972, Ray was asked to show some footage from the film at a conference. The audience was shocked to see footage of Ray and his students smoking [[marijuana]] together.<ref name="live fast"/> An early version of the film was shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1973, but Ray, never satisfied with the project, continued editing it until his death in 1979.

The extemporaneous, improvisational nature of the film placed Ray in conflict with colleagues such as [[Ken Jacobs]] and Larry Gottheim in the university's [[New American Cinema]]-oriented film department, and his contract was not renewed in the spring of 1973. With the help of old friends, he would eventually secure teaching positions at the [[Lee Strasberg Institute]] and [[New York University]], where he mentored graduate student [[Jim Jarmusch]].<ref name="live fast"/>

Shortly before his death he collaborated on the direction of ''[[Lightning Over Water]]'' (also known as ''Nick’s Film'') with [[Germany|German]] director [[Wim Wenders]]. He died of [[lung cancer]] on June 16, 1979 in [[New York City]] after a two-year illness.<ref name="live fast"/> Ray died the same week as [[John Wayne]], the star of ''[[Flying Leathernecks]]'', a film Ray directed (Wayne had died on June 11).

==Personal life==
Ray was married to:

*Jean Evans (born Jean Abrams), journalist, married 1936, divorced 1940. They had one son, Anthony (aka Tony, born 1937).
*[[Gloria Grahame]], actress, whom he married in 1948. They separated in 1950 and divorced in 1952 after the director discovered Grahame in bed with his son, Tony, who was then 13 years old.<ref name="live fast">{{cite book

Grahame and Nicholas Ray had one son, Timothy Ray. 
*Betty Utley, dancer, married 1958, divorced 1964; two daughters, Nica and Julie.
*Susan Schwartz, married 1969 until his death in 1979.

==Influence==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}

In the decades after his professional peak, Ray continues to influence directors to this day. In particular, certain [[French New Wave]] directors and critics held Ray in high regard:

* [[Jean-Luc Godard]] was a huge admirer of Ray and famously said in his review of ''Bitter Victory'': "There was theatre ([[D. W. Griffith|Griffith]]), poetry ([[F. W. Murnau|Murnau]]), painting ([[Roberto Rossellini|Rossellini]]), dance ([[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]), music ([[Jean Renoir|Renoir]]). Henceforth there is cinema. And the cinema is Nicholas Ray." In addition, Godard's films abound in multiple references to Nicholas Ray's films. In Godard's film, ''[[Contempt (film)|Contempt]]'', the character played by [[Michel Piccoli]] claims to have written Ray's ''Bigger Than Life'' and in ''[[La Chinoise]]'', a young Maoist defends the politics of ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' to his anti-American colleagues.

* [[François Truffaut]] wrote essays about Ray (who is featured prominently in his book ''The Films in My Life''). He asserts that ''[[They Live by Night]]'' (1949) is Ray's best movie, but gives special attention to his films ''Bigger Than Life'' (1956) and ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954).

* [[Martin Scorsese]] is a fan of Ray's, particularly his expressionistic use of color in ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954), ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955) and ''Bigger Than Life'' (1956). He used clips from two of them in his documentary ''[[A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies]]''.

* Director [[Curtis Hanson]] is featured on a documentary for the DVD release of ''[[In A Lonely Place]]'', giving his analysis of the film. The film was one of many influences on his direction of ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' (1997).

* [[Wim Wenders]] is another European admirer of Ray's and has paid homage to him in many movies. Many of his films are indebted to Ray, from the title of his science fiction film ''[[Until the End of the World]]'' (which were the last spoken words in Ray’s biblical epic ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'') to the casting of [[Dennis Hopper]] (who starred in ''Rebel Without a Cause'') and the expressionistic use of colour in his own film ''[[The American Friend]]''. He even gave Ray a cameo in this film. He also co-directed Ray's final film, the experimental documentary ''[[Lightning Over Water]]'', and edited it after Ray's death. The film is a touching portrait of the final days of Nicholas Ray's life.
