When Apatow was twelve years old, his parents divorced. Robert went to live with his maternal grandparents, and Mia went to live with her mother. As a child, Apatow lived mainly with his father, and visited his mother on weekends. Apatow’s mother spent a summer working at a comedy club, which is where Judd was first exposed to live [[stand-up comedy]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Judd Apatow 30-year career timeline: from stand-up comedy to his "Knocked Up" spin-off |date=2011-10-19 |url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2011/10/judd-apatow-career-timeline |work=IFC.com |accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>

== Career ==

=== Early work ===
Apatow began performing stand-up comedy at age seventeen, during his senior year of high school.<ref name="nytimes" /> In the September 1985 issue of ''Laugh Factory Magazine'', he is listed as an Associate Editor. After graduating from high school in 1985, he moved to Los Angeles and enrolled in the screenwriting program at [[University of Southern California]].<ref name="nytimes" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cinema.usc.edu/alumni/notable.cfm |title=Sampling of Notable USC Alumni Working in Cinema/Television/Interactive |publisher=USC School of Cinematic Arts |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref> While at USC, he organized and hosted a number of on-campus "Comedy Night" events, featuring headliners such as ''Saturday Night Live'' performer [[Kevin Nealon]]. Apatow introduced the acts at these events with short standup routines of his own. He also began volunteering at (and later producing) benefit concerts for HBO's [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] and performing and seeing standup at [[the Improv]] in Hollywood.<ref name="nytimes" /> Apatow dropped out of college during his sophomore year and later moved into an apartment with comedian [[Adam Sandler]], whom he met at the Improv.<ref name="nytimes" /> He competed in the Johnnie Walker Comedy Search in 1989.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news |last=Abramowitz |first=Rachel |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-apatow13may13,1,1056915.story |title=The king of Geeks |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2007-05-13 |accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref>

Shortly thereafter, Apatow was introduced by manager Jimmy Miller to [[Garry Shandling]] which resulted in Apatow being hired as a writer for the [[Grammy Awards]] that year, which Shandling hosted.<ref name="Daily Variety">{{cite news |last=Newman |first=Melinda |url= |title=Man most likely to inspire |work=[[Daily Variety]] |date=2012-10-29 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> In 1992, Apatow appeared on [[Home Box Office|HBO's]] ''15th Annual Young Comedians Special'' <ref name="wild">{{cite news | last = Michaels | first = Chad | title = Judd Apatow Interview | publisher = Wild About Movies | date = 2007-05-23 | url = http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/interviews/Judd-Apatow-Interview.php | accessdate = 2007-06-04 }}</ref> and shortly afterwards went on to co-create and executive produce ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'' for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. Apatow had met Stiller outside of an [[Elvis Costello]] concert in 1990, and they became friends.  Despite critical acclaim and an [[Emmy Award]] for Apatow and the rest of the writing staff, Fox canceled the show in 1993.<ref name="Vanity Fair">{{cite news |last=Marcus |first=Bennett |url= http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2012/11/judd-apatow-ben-stiller-show-comedy |title=

Apatow went on to join HBO’s ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' in 1993 as a writer and consulting producer, and he later served as a co-executive producer and director of an episode during the show’s final season in 1998.<ref name="latimes" /> Apatow credits Shandling as his mentor for influencing him to write comedy that is more character-driven.<ref name="latimes" /> Apatow earned six [[Emmy]] nominations for his work on Larry Sanders. During this same time, Apatow also worked as a consulting producer and staff writer for the animated show ''[[The Critic]]'', starring [[Jon Lovitz]].<ref name="IFC">{{cite news |last=Locker |first=Melissa |url= http://www.ifc.com/fix/2010/12/12-days-of-judd-apatow-day-5-t |title=12 Days of Judd Apatow: Day 5 "The Critic" |work= IFC |date=2010-12-21 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref>

In 1995, Apatow co-wrote (with Steve Brill) the feature film ''[[Heavyweights]]''. Around the same time, Apatow was hired to re-write the script for the movie ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', which was released in 1996 to mixed reviews.<ref name="variety">{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Anne |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117964732.html?categoryid=2508&cs=1 |title=Hot Apatow new king of comedy |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2007-05-11 |accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> It was during the pre-production of the film that Apatow met his future wife, actress [[Leslie Mann]].<ref name=actors/> Apatow also did uncredited re-writes on two other [[Jim Carrey]] films: ''[[Liar, Liar]]'' and ''[[Bruce Almighty]]''.<ref name="E!

His next script was entitled ''Making Amends'', which had [[Owen Wilson]] attached to star as a man in [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] who decides to apologize to everyone he has ever hurt. However, the film was never made.<ref name="variety" /> Apatow did an uncredited rewrite of the 1998 [[Adam Sandler]] comedy film ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' and was featured in four tracks on Sandler's 1996 comedy album "[[What the Hell Happened to Me?]]."<ref name="variety" />{{failed verification|date=November 2010}} In 1999, Apatow created ''Sick In The Head'', a multi-camera sitcom pilot starring [[David Krumholtz]] as a psychiatrist on his first day on the job, [[Amy Poehler]] as a suicidal patient,  and [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Krumholtz’s slacker roommate. The cast also included [[Kevin McDonald]], [[Austin Pendleton]], and [[Andrea Martin]].<ref name="Splitsider">{{cite news |last=Evans |first=Bradford |url= http://splitsider.com/2011/05/the-lost-projects-of-judd-apatow/ |title= The Lost Projects of Judd Apatow |work= Splitsider |date=2011-05-12 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref> The show was not picked up by Fox, which freed up Apatow to serve as an executive producer of the award-winning series ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', which debuted in 1999.  He also wrote and directed several episodes of the series.  After its cancellation, Apatow was the executive producer and creator of the series ''[[Undeclared]]'', which reused [[Seth Rogen]] in the main cast and other ''Freaks and Geeks'' cast members in recurring roles. Although both shows were quickly canceled, [[USA Today]] media critic Susan Wloszczyna called the shows "two of the most acclaimed TV series to ever last only one season."<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news |last=Wloszczyna |first=Susan |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-05-06-judd-apatow_N.htm |title=For Apatow, opportunity knocks |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2007-06-04 |date=2007-05-06}}</ref>

In 2001, Apatow created ''North Hollywood'', a pilot about struggling actors that featured [[Jason Segel]], [[Kevin Hart (actor)|Kevin Hart]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Phil Hendrie]], and [[Judge Reinhold]] (playing himself). The pilot was not picked up by Fox. The following year, Apatow co-wrote (with [[Brent Forrester]]) a Fox pilot titled ''Life On Parole'', starring ''[[Office Space]]''’s [[David Herman]] as a dissatisfied [[parole officer]] whose roommate happens to be one of his parolees; it was not picked up.  Apatow has screened and introduced them at "The Other Network", a festival of un-aired TV pilots produced by [[Un-Cabaret]].<ref name="Splitsider" />

In 2004, Apatow [[film producer|produced]] the feature film comedy ''[[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy]]'', starring [[Will Ferrell]] and directed by [[Adam McKay]].<ref name=actors/> The film was a box office success. Apatow co-produced the 2013 sequel, ''[[Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues]]''.<ref name="Los Angeles Times">{{cite news |last=Day |first=Patrick |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2012/03/anchorman-2-will-ferrell-ron-burgundy-conan.html |title='Anchorman 2': Will Ferrell drops sequel news on 'Conan' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2012-11-25 |date=2012-03-29}}</ref>
[[File:Judd Apatow.jpg|thumbnail|Apatow, in 2007]]
Apatow made his feature directorial debut in 2005 with the hit ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', which he also co-wrote with the film's star, [[Steve Carell]], for [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]. The film opened at No. 1 and grossed more than $175 million globally.<ref name="variety" /> The comedy also garnered numerous awards and nominations, including being named one of [[American Film Institute|AFI]]'s Top Movies of the Year, as well as taking home Best Comedy Movie at the 11th annual Critics' Choice Awards.<ref>{{cite web |title=AFI Announces Their Selection of 2005's Best Movies|publisher=About.com |date=2006-08-18 |url=http://movies.about.com/od/awards/a/afi12005121105.htm |accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'' also earned Apatow a nomination for Best Original Screenplay from the [[Writers Guild of America]] and received four [[MTV Movie Award]] nominations, including a win for Carell for Best Comedic Performance.<ref>{{cite news |last=Buckalew |first=Brett |title=No Longer a Feature Film ''Virgin'' |publisher=Filmstew.com |date=2006-08-18 |url=http://www.filmstew.com/showArticle.aspx?ContentID=14646 |accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref>

His film ''[[Knocked Up]]'' was released in June 2007 to wide critical acclaim. Apatow wrote the initial draft of the film on the set of ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby|Talladega Nights]]''.<ref name="latimes" /> In addition to being a critical success, the film was also a commercial hit, continuing Apatow's newfound mainstream success.

In August 2007, Apatow produced the film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', which was written by [[Seth Rogen]] and his writing partner [[Evan Goldberg]]. A concept Rogen and Goldberg had created as teens, Apatow convinced Rogen to write the film as a vehicle for himself in 2000. Rogen and Goldberg finished writing the film, but were unable to find a studio interested in producing it. Apatow then enlisted Rogen and Goldberg to write ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'', a [[Drug culture|stoner]] action movie that he felt would be more commercial. After the success of ''Anchorman'' and ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'', Apatow was still unable to sell both ''Superbad'' and ''Pineapple Express''; it was only after he produced the commercial hit ''[[Talladega Nights]]'' that [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] decided to produce both.<ref name="variety" /> At this point, Rogen was unable to play the lead for ''Superbad'', as he had grown too old to play the part of Seth. Subsequently, he was cast in a supporting role as a police officer and friend [[Jonah Hill]] took his role as the high school student. Apatow credits Rogen for influencing him to make his work more "outrageously dirty."<ref name="latimes" /> In August 2007, ''Superbad'' opened at No. 1 in the box office to critical acclaim, taking in $33 million in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite news |last=Coyle |first=Jake |title=How Did 'Superbad' Top the Box Office? |work=Breitbart |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 21, 2007 |url=http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8R5D6080}}</ref> Industry insiders claimed Apatow was now a brand unto himself, creating movies geared toward older audiences, who would watch his movies even when the films delved into the teen genre.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dergarabedian |first=Paul |title=Paul Dergarabedian Watch: Paul D.

Apatow has worked with a group of actors on an ongoing basis, including [[Steve Carell]], [[Paul Rudd]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Jonah Hill]], and [[Jason Segel]], and also tends to work with his close friends.<ref name="latimes" /> He has frequently worked with producers [[Shauna Robertson]] and Barry Mendel.<ref name="variety" /> He reunited with [[Jason Segel]] and [[Amy Poehler]] for the 2001 Fox sitcom pilot, ''North Hollywood''.

=== 2007–2015 ===
Apatow served as producer and co-writer along with director [[Jake Kasdan]] for the biopic spoof ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story|Walk Hard]]'' starring [[John C. Reilly]], [[Kristen Wiig]] and [[Jenna Fischer]], which was released in December 2007. While the film received positive reviews, it did poorly commercially. In 2008, he served as producer for ''[[Drillbit Taylor]]'' starring Owen Wilson and his wife [[Leslie Mann]] and written by Seth Rogen, which opened in March and earned negative reviews. For the rest of 2008, Apatow produced the comedy films ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]'' starring [[Jason Segel]] and [[Kristen Bell]]; ''[[Step Brothers (film)|Step Brothers]]'', which reunites ''Talladega Nights'' co-stars [[Will Ferrell]] and [[John C. Reilly]]; and ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'' starring Seth Rogen and [[James Franco]], both of whom originally starred on ''Freaks and Geeks''. In addition, he served as co-writer for the [[Adam Sandler]] comedy film ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'', which Sandler and [[Robert Smigel]] also co-wrote.

In 2009, Apatow served as producer for the biblical comedy film ''[[Year One (film)|Year One]]'', starring [[Jack Black]] and [[Michael Cera]], and directed by [[Harold Ramis]]; the film was not well received. He also released his third directorial feature on July 31 that same year, titled ''[[Funny People]]''. Apatow wrote the film, which starred [[Adam Sandler]] and [[Seth Rogen]] as a pair of standup comedians, one of whom has a terminal illness.

Apatow produced ''[[Begin Again (film)|Begin Again]]'', starring [[Keira Knightley]] who plays a singer-songwriter who is discovered by a struggling record label executive (played by [[Mark Ruffalo]]) and collaborates with him to produce an album recorded in public locations all over New York City.

=== Debate ===
In 2007 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine noted that [former Apatow associate] [[Mike White (scriptwriter)|Mike White]] ... was "disenchanted" by Apatow's later films, "objecting to the treatment of women and gay men in Apatow's recent movies", saying of ''Knocked Up'', "At some point it starts feeling like comedy of the bullies, rather than the bullied."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/05/mike_white_calls_out_judd_apat.html |title=Mike White Calls Out Judd Apatow |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2007-05-07 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref> In a highly publicized ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' interview, lead actress [[Katherine Heigl]] admitted that though she enjoyed working with Apatow, she had a hard time enjoying ''Knocked Up'' herself, calling the movie, "a little sexist," claiming that the film "paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight." In response to accusations of sexism, Apatow told an interviewer that the characters in the film ''Knocked Up'' "are sexist at times… but it's really about immature people who are afraid of women and relationships and learn to grow up."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2007/12/marketing_genius_judd_apatow_t.html |title=Marketing Genius Judd Apatow Turns Katherine Heigl's 'Knocked Up' Slam Into a Sales Pitch |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2007-12-06 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>

[[Kristen Wiig]], in a speech presenting Apatow with the Herb Sargent Award for Comedy Excellence in February 2012 said that he was an "incredible collaborator and supporter"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laughspin.com/2012/02/20/watch-kristen-wiig-introduce-judd-apatow-and-then-watch-judd-apatows-comedy-award-acceptance-speech/ |title=Watch Kristen Wiig introduce Judd Apatow and Judd Apatow's comedy award speech|work=LaughSpin |date=2012-02-12 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}</ref> and in a 2011 interview with ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', filmmaker [[Lena Dunham]], who has collaborated often with Apatow said of his work, "''Knocked Up'' is really about love. ... His movies are about people trying to get closer to themselves. He's the perfect match for a story about being 25, because that's all 25-year-olds are interested in. The other problems they encounter—money issues, conflicts at work—don't matter."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elle.com/pop-culture/celebrities/comedys-unlikely-feminist-3 |title=Judd Apatow, Comedy's Unlikely Feminist |work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}</ref>

Other writers, such as [[ThinkProgress]]' Alyssa Rosenberg, praise Apatow for his "wonderfully refreshing" approach to women and comedy, quoting Apatow as saying "I got bored of penises. I said, 'enough of that.' No, I just like immaturity, I like to show people struggle and try to figure out who they are. I'm a guy and so it leaned guy for a while. But one of the projects I’m most proud of is ''Freaks and Geeks'', which is about a woman in high school struggling to figure out which group she wants to belong to, so for me, it goes back and forth. ..."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/04/09/459940/judd-apatow-is-the-cure-for-the-common-lee-aronsohn/?mobile=nc|title=Judd Apatow Is the Cure for the Common Lee Aronsohn |publisher=[[ThinkProgress]] |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}</ref>
