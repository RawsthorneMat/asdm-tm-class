From 2011 to 2013, Dern starred as Amy Jellicoe in HBO's ''[[Enlightened]]''. For this role, she won the 2011 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actress in a Television Series Musical or Comedy.

In 2014 Dern made a return to film work, appearing in ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'', ''[[When the Game Stands Tall]]'', ''[[99 Homes]]'', and ''[[Wild (film)|Wild]]'', the latter for which she received her second [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Academy Award]] nomination.

==Early life==
Dern was born in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], the daughter of actors [[Bruce Dern]] and [[Diane Ladd]], and great-granddaughter of former [[Utah]] governor and [[Secretary of War]], [[George Dern]]. The [[poet]], [[writer]], and [[Librarian of Congress]] [[Archibald MacLeish]] was her great-great-uncle. Laura Dern's film debut was a cameo in her mother's film ''[[White Lightning (1973 film)|White Lightning]]'' (1973). She also made a brief appearance in ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), one of Ladd's signature roles. Her mother objected to her 13-year-old daughter's presence on the set of ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains]]'', but Dern sued for and received [[Emancipation of minors|emancipation]]. In 1982, she became the youngest-ever winner of [[Miss Golden Globe]].

==Career==
Dern began working with acting coach [[Sandra Seacat]] in 1984. Dern would later attribute Seacat with a dramatic transformation in her life and work.<ref>Jamie Painter Young: "Profile: Defining Moments," ''Back Stage West'', November 22–28, 2001, pp. 6-7. "Dern: Through studying and through being raised on movie sets, I was surrounded by a lot of people who believed that the more tortured the person, the greater the artist. I always had a hard time understanding that, but thought, I guess that's the way it is... Luckily through life and the gift of the acting teacher who's changed my life in so many ways since 1984--her name is Sandra Seacat--I learned there's another opinion, which is: the better the person, the better the artist. The more true you are to who you are and the more honest you are as an individual, the more honest you can be as an actor, and I'm really liking that.  BSW: Do you still study acting?  Dern: I still study with Sandra and I love studying."</ref> Speaking with ''[[Backstage Magazine|Back Stage West]]'' again in 2004, Dern would expand upon her earlier comments;<ref>Jenelle Riley: [http://barksmatt.tripod.com/backstage.html "Living Out Loud,"] ''Back Stage West'', August 16, 2004 (scroll all the way down - Dern's next-to-last comment)</ref> most recently, Dern thanked Seacat in her acceptance speech for Best Actress in a Television Series at the [[69th Golden Globe Awards|69th Annual Golden Globe Awards]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xnpue5_golden-globes-actress-tv-series-comedy-or-musical-laura-dern_shortfilms|title=Laura Dern's 2012 Golden Globes acceptance speech for Best Actress |publisher=Dailymotion.com |date=2012-01-16 |accessdate=2012-09-06}}</ref>

Between 1985 and 1990, Dern gained critical acclaim for roles in ''[[Mask (film)|Mask]]'', ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', and ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]''. Dern's starring role in ''Blue Velvet'' was a breakthrough though her next notable film, ''Wild at Heart'', took almost four years to be released. Dern's affiliation with [[David Lynch]] has continued with her role in ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]''. In 1992, Dern and her mother became the first mother and daughter to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for acting in the same film in ''[[Rambling Rose (film)|Rambling Rose]]'' although, unlike in ''Wild at Heart'', they did not play mother and daughter in the film. Dern starred as Dr. Ellie Sattler in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1993 blockbuster ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. That same year, [[Clint Eastwood]] enlisted the actress for his film ''[[A Perfect World]]''. She also starred as Ruth in the 1996 [[satire]] ''[[Citizen Ruth]]'', the directorial debut of [[Alexander Payne]]. Dern's mother makes a cameo appearance, playing Dern's character's mother, with Dern's character screaming a torrent of abuse at her. In 1997, Dern was featured in [[Widespread Panic]]'s music video for their song, "Aunt Avis", which was directed by Dern's then boyfriend and future fiancé, [[Billy Bob Thornton]]. In 1998, Dern co-starred in [[Jodie Foster| Jodie Foster's]] film ''The Baby Dance''. While dating Thornton in 1999, she was cast as his love interest in his film ''[[Daddy and Them]]'', which also includes [[Diane Ladd]]. Dern also appeared in [[Joe Johnston]]'s film ''[[October Sky]]''.

[[Robert Altman]] called upon Dern's talents to play a [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]]-loving Aunt in his Texas-based comedy ''[[Dr. T & the Women]]'' in 2000. She co-starred in ''Within These Walls'' and [[Arthur Miller's]] ''[[Focus (2001 film)|Focus]]''. She had a minor role in ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'', and was a supporting actor in the film ''[[I Am Sam]]''.

Dern was part of the ensemble dramedy ''[[Happy Endings (film)|Happy Endings]]'' in 2005, and she appeared in the 2006 film ''[[The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio]]''. In 2006, David Lynch and Dern reunited for ''Inland Empire'' and, also in 2006, Dern had a supporting role in ''[[Lonely Hearts (2006 film)|Lonely Hearts]]''. [[Mike White (scriptwriter)|Mike White]], known for writing ''[[School of Rock]]'' and ''[[The Good Girl]]'', hired Dern for his directorial debut in 2007, the comedy titled ''[[Year of the Dog (film)|Year of the Dog]]'' and starring [[Molly Shannon]], [[John C. Reilly]], and [[Peter Sarsgaard]]. In 2008 Dern starred in ''[[Recount (film)|Recount]]'' for which she won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Series, Miniseries or Television Film]].

She guest-starred on ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', was a voice on ''[[King of the Hill]]'', and was a [[lesbian]] who coaxes [[Ellen DeGeneres]] out of the closet in the famous 1997 "[[The Puppy Episode]]" of the television series ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''. On the April 24, 2007 airing of [[The Ellen DeGeneres Show|DeGeneres's talk show]], Dern revealed she did not work for more than a year following her appearance in that episode because of resulting backlash, but nevertheless called it an "extraordinary experience and opportunity."<ref>{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Ellen and Laura Dern reunite after kiss|date=2007-04-23|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18279014/|accessdate=2008-11-20}}</ref>
