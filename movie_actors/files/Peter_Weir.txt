'''Peter Lindsay Weir''', [[Order of Australia|AM]] ({{IPAc-en|w|ɪər}}; born 21 August 1944) is an Australian film director. He played a leading role in the [[Australian New Wave]] cinema (1970-1990) with his films such as the mystery drama ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' (1975), the mystery drama-thriller ''[[The Last Wave]]'' (1977) and the historical drama ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'' (1981). The climax of Weir's early career was the $6 million multi-national production ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'' (1983), starring [[Mel Gibson]], playing opposite the well-known American actress [[Sigourney Weaver]] as the female lead. 

After the success of ''The Year of Living Dangerously'', Weir directed a diverse group of [[Cinema of the United States|American]] and international films—many of them major box office hits—including the [[Academy Award]] nominated films such as the thriller ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985), the drama ''[[Dead Poets Society]]'' (1989), the romantic comedy ''[[Green Card (film)|Green Card]]'' (1990), the social science fiction comedy-drama ''[[The Truman Show]]'' (1998) and the epic historical drama film ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World|Master and Commander]]'' (2003), which starred [[Russell Crowe]].

==Early life and career==
Weir was born in Sydney, the son of Peggy (née Barnsley) and Lindsay Weir, a real estate agent.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/1/Peter-Weir.html Peter Weir Biography (1944–)]</ref> Weir attended [[The Scots College]] and [[Vaucluse High School|Vaucluse Boys' High School]] before studying arts and law at the [[University of Sydney]]. His interest in film was sparked by his meeting with fellow students, including [[Phillip Noyce]] and the future members of the Sydney filmmaking collective [[Ubu Films]]. After leaving university in the mid-1960s he joined Sydney television station [[ATN-7]], where he worked as a production assistant on the groundbreaking satirical comedy program ''[[The Mavis Bramston Show]]''. During this period, using station facilities, he made his first two experimental short films, ''Count Vim's Last Exercise'' and ''The Life and Flight of Reverend Buckshotte''.

Weir then took up a position with the [[Commonwealth Film Unit]] (later renamed [[Film Australia]]), for which he made several documentaries, including a short documentary about an underprivileged outer Sydney suburb, ''Whatever Happened to Green Valley'', in which residents were invited to make their own film segments. Another notable film in this period was the short rock music performance film ''Three Directions In Australian Pop Music'' (1972), which featured in-concert colour footage of three of the most significant Melbourne rock acts of the period, [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]], [[The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band]] and [[Wendy Saddington]]. He also directed one section of the three-part, three-director feature film ''Three To Go'' (1970), which won an [[Australian Film Institute|AFI award]].

After leaving the CFU, Weir made his first major independent film, the short feature ''[[Homesdale]]'' (1971), an offbeat [[black comedy]] which co-starred rising young actress [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] and musician and comedian [[Grahame Bond]], who came to fame in 1972 as the star of ''[[The Aunty Jack Show]]''; Weir also played a small role, but this was to be his last significant screen appearance. ''Homesdale'' and Weir's two aforementioned CFU shorts have been released on DVD. Weir's first full-length feature film was the underground cult classic, ''[[The Cars That Ate Paris]]'' (1974), a low-budget black comedy about the inhabitants of a small country town who deliberately cause fatal car crashes and live off the proceeds. It was a minor success in cinemas but proved very popular on the then-thriving [[drive-in]] circuit.

Weir's major breakthrough in Australia and internationally was the lush, atmospheric period mystery ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' (1975), made with substantial backing from the state-funded [[South Australian Film Corporation]] and filmed on location in South Australia and rural Victoria. Based on the novel by [[Joan Lindsay]], the film relates the purportedly "true" story of a group of students from an exclusive girls' school who mysteriously vanish from a school picnic on Valentine's Day 1900. Widely credited as a key work in the "Australian film renaissance" of the mid-1970s, ''Picnic'' was the first Australian film of its era to gain both critical praise and be given substantial international theatrical releases. It also helped launch the career of internationally renowned Australian cinematographer [[Russell Boyd]]. It was widely acclaimed by critics, many of whom praised it as a welcome antidote to the so-called "ocker film" genre, typified by ''[[The Adventures of Barry McKenzie]]'' and ''[[Alvin Purple]]''.

Weir's next film, ''[[The Last Wave]]'' (1977) was a supernatural thriller about a man who begins to experience terrifying visions of an impending natural disaster. It starred the American actor [[Richard Chamberlain]], who was well-known to Australian and world audiences as the eponymous physician in the popular ''[[Dr. Kildare]]'' TV series, and would later star in the Australian-set major series ''[[The Thorn Birds (TV miniseries)|The Thorn Birds]]''.  ''The Last Wave'' was a pensive, ambivalent work that expanded on themes from ''Picnic'', exploring the interactions between the native [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] and European cultures. It co-starred the aboriginal actor [[David Gulpilil]], whose performance won the Golden Ibex (Oscar equivalent) at the Tehran International Festival in 1977, but it was only a moderate commercial success at the time.

Between ''The Last Wave'' and his next feature, Weir wrote and directed the offbeat low-budget telemovie ''[[The Plumber]]'' (1979).<ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/new/the-dreadful-ten-camillas-top-ten-forgotten-australian-horrors/ The Plumber]</ref> It starred Australian actors [[Judy Morris]] and [[Ivar Kants]] and was filmed in just three weeks.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079727/trivia IMDb – ''The Plumber'' (1979) (TV) – Trivia]</ref> Inspired by a real-life experience told to him by friends, it is a black comedy about a woman whose life is disrupted by a subtly menacing plumber. Weir scored a major Australian hit and further international praise with his next film, the historical adventure-drama ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'' (1981). Scripted by the Australian playwright [[David Williamson]], it is regarded as classic [[Cinema of Australia|Australian cinema]]. ''Gallipoli'' was instrumental in making [[Mel Gibson]] (''[[Mad Max]]'') into a major star, although his co-star [[Mark Lee (actor)|Mark Lee]], who also received high praise for his role, has made relatively few screen appearances since.

The climax of Weir's early career was the $6 million multi-national production ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'' (1983), again starring Mel Gibson, playing opposite top Hollywood female lead [[Sigourney Weaver]] in a story about journalistic loyalty, idealism, love and ambition in the turmoil of [[Sukarno]]'s [[Indonesia]] of 1965. It was an adaptation of the novel by [[Christopher Koch]], which was based in part on the experiences of Koch's journalist brother Philip, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s Jakarta correspondent and one of the few western journalists in the city during the 1965 attempted coup. The film also won [[Linda Hunt]] (who played a man in the film) an Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. The film was produced by [[Hal and Jim McElroy|Jim McElroy]], who with his brother [[Hal and Jim McElroy|Hal McElroy]] had also (co-)produced Weir's first three films, ''The Cars That Ate Paris'', ''Picnic at Hanging Rock'' and ''The Last Wave''.

On 14 June 1982, Weir was appointed a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM) for his service to the film industry.<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=883051&search_type=quick&showInd=true It's an Honour] – Member of the Order of Australia</ref> He resides in Sydney with his wife Wendy Stites. They have been married since 1966.

==Filmmaking in the United States==
Weir's first [[Cinema of the United States|American film]] was the successful thriller ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' (1985), the first of two films he made with [[Harrison Ford]], about a boy who sees the murder of an undercover police officer and has to be hidden away in his [[Amish]] community to protect him. Child star [[Lukas Haas]] received wide praise for his debut film performance; ''[[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]]'' also earned Weir his first [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination as [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and was his first of several films to be nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], it later won 2 for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] & [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]].

It was followed by the darker, less commercial ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), [[Paul Schrader]]'s adaptation of [[Paul Theroux]]'s novel, with Ford playing a man obsessively pursuing his dream to start a new life in the Central American jungle with his family. These dramatic parts provided Harrison Ford with important opportunities to break the typecasting of his career-making roles in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series. Both films showed off his ability to play more subtle and substantial characters and he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his work in ''Witness'', the only Academy Awards recognition in his career. ''The Mosquito Coast'' is also notable for an impressive performance by the young [[River Phoenix]].

Weir's next film, ''[[Dead Poets Society]]'', was a major international success, with Weir again receiving credit for expanding the acting range of its Hollywood star. [[Robin Williams]] was mainly known for his anarchic stand-up comedy and his popular TV role as the wisecracking alien in ''[[Mork & Mindy]]''; in this film he played an inspirational teacher in a dramatic story about conformity and rebellion at an exclusive New England [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] in the 1950s. The film was nominated for four Oscars, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Weir, it later won for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]] and launched the acting careers of young actors [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Robert Sean Leonard]]. It became a major box-office hit and is one of Weir's best-known films for mainstream audiences.

Weir's first romantic comedy ''[[Green Card (film)|Green Card]]'' (1990) was another casting risk. Weir chose French screen icon [[Gérard Depardieu]] in the lead—Depardieu's first English-language role—and paired him with American actress [[Andie MacDowell]]. ''Green Card'' was a box-office hit but was regarded as less of a critical success, although it helped Depardieu's path to international fame, and Weir received an Oscar nomination for his original screenplay.

''[[Fearless (1993 film)|Fearless]]'' (1993) returned to darker themes and starred [[Jeff Bridges]] as a man who believes he has become invincible after surviving a catastrophic air crash. Though well reviewed, particularly the performances of Bridges and [[Rosie Perez]]—who received an Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]]—the film was less commercially successful than Weir's two preceding films. It was entered into the [[44th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1994/02_programm_1994/02_Programm_1994.html |title=Berlinale: 1994 Programme |accessdate=12 June 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

After five years, Weir returned to direct his biggest success to date, ''[[The Truman Show]]'' (1998), a fantasy-[[satire]] of the media's control of life. ''[[The Truman Show]]'' was both a box office and a critical success, receiving positive reviews and numerous awards, including three Academy Award nominations: [[Andrew Niccol]] for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|Best Original Screenplay]], [[Ed Harris]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]], and Weir himself for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].

In 2003 Weir returned to period drama with ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'', starring [[Russell Crowe]]. A screen adaptation from various episodes in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s blockbuster adventure series set during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it was well received by critics, but only mildly successful with mainstream audiences. Despite another nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[List of accolades received by Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World|winning two Oscars]]—for frequent collaborator [[Russell Boyd]]'s cinematography and for sound effects editing—the film's box office success was moderate ($93 million at the North American Box Office). The film grossed slightly better overseas, gleaning an additional $114 million.

Weir wrote and directed his next film, ''[[The Way Back]]'' (2010),<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117994186.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 Peter Weir find his 'Way Back': Australian helmer to write, direct fact-based film – Variety.]</ref> which, as another historical epic, was well received critically but was not a financial success.

==Unfinished projects==
*In 1979, [[John Calley]] of Warner Bros offered Weir ''[[Salem's Lot]]'' but he turned it down.<ref name="stratton">David Stratton, ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus & Robertson, 1980 p81</ref>
*In 1980, he worked on an adaptation of ''[[The Thorn Birds]]'' but pulled out of the project.<ref name="stratton"/>
*In 1993, Weir spoke about making an adaptation of [[Thomas Keneally]]'s novel ''[[The Playmaker]]'', focusing on the theatre profession in Australia at the turn of the 20th century,<ref>[http://www.peterweircave.com/articles/articleb.html Interview With Peter Weir: Fearless<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but this did not see production. 
*In the 1990s, Weir was considered as a director for the film adaptation of [[Toni Morrison]]'s novel ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'', but he was ruled out in favor of [[Jonathan Demme]] at an early stage, allegedly due to conflicts over the casting of star/producer [[Oprah Winfrey]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285239_2,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=Brawl Over 'Beloved'}}</ref>
*In the mid-2000s, according to [[The Internet Movie Database]], Weir was attached as director of several other projects. He was to direct a film adaptation of [[William Gibson]]'s 2003 novel ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]''. He was also attached to a film adaptation of [[Gregory David Roberts]]' book ''[[Shantaram (novel)|Shantaram]]'', starring [[Johnny Depp]]; he left the project, which later folded in 2009. He was also planning to direct two other films: ''War Magician'' and ''[[Shadow Divers]]''.
