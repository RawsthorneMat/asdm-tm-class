==Career==
===Films===
While playing in [[Los Angeles]] on a touring [[box lacrosse]] team in 1937, he impressed [[Joe E. Brown]] with his [[athleticism]].

He played a substantial role as John Crow in ''[[Santee (film)|Santee]]'' (1973), starring [[Glenn Ford]].  One of his last roles was a wise white-haired chief in ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'' (1973).

===Television===
[[File:Lone Ranger and Tonto 1956.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|alt= Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger and Jay Silverheels as Tonto.|[[Clayton Moore]] as [[the Lone Ranger]] and Jay Silverheels as [[Tonto]]. Moore is riding Silver, while Silverheels is riding Scout.]]
Silverheels achieved his greatest fame as Tonto on ''The Lone Ranger''. The fictional story line maintains that a small group of [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], except for The Lone Ranger, were massacred. The Lone Ranger and Tonto then ride throughout the West to assist those challenged by the lawless element. Their expenses and bullets are provided through a silver mine owned by The Lone Ranger, who also names his horse "Silver".<ref>Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), p. 103</ref> Being irreplaceable in his role, Silverheels appeared in film sequels:  ''The Lone Ranger'' (1956) and ''The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold'' (1958).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.walkoffame.com/jay-silverheels |title=  In addition to starring in ''The Lone Ranger'' television series from 1949 to 1957, Silverheels appeared in the films ''The Lone Ranger'' and ''The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold''.|publisher=Walkoffame.com|accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}</ref>

When ''The Lone Ranger'' television series ended, Silverheels found himself firmly typecast as an American Indian. On January 6, 1960, he portrayed an Indian fireman trying to extinguish a forest fire in the episode "Leap of Life" in the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series, ''[[Rescue 8]]'', starring [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]] and [[Lang Jeffries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074043/|title=Leap of Life, ''Rescue 8'', January 6, 1960|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref>

Eventually, he went to work as a salesman to supplement his acting income.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.amoeba.com/blog/2010/11/eric-s-blog/jay-silverheels-happy-american-indian-heritage-month.html |title= with his career no longer sufficient to support his family, he began working as a salesman.|publisher=Amoeba.com |accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}</ref> He also began to publish poetry inspired by his youth on the Six Nations Indian Reserve and recited his work on television. In 1966, he guest-starred as John Tallgrass in the short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] comedy/western series ''[[The Rounders (TV series)|The Rounders]]'', with [[Ron Hayes]], [[Patrick Wayne]], and [[Chill Wills]].

Despite the typecasting, Silverheels in later years often poked fun at his character. In 1969, he appeared as Tonto without The Lone Ranger in a comedy sketch on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I6_x4ZjPvY  |title= Silverheels as "Tonto" in Jimmy Carson's Late Night Show (film)|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}</ref> The sketch was featured on the 1973 record album ''Here's Johnny:  Magic Moments From The Tonight Show''. "My name is Tonto. I hail from Toronto and I speak [[Esperanto]]." In 1970, he appeared in a commercial for Chevrolet as an Indian chief who rescues two lost hunters who ignored his advice in that year's [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevy Blazer]]. The [[William Tell Overture]] is heard in the background. 

Silverheels hilariously spoofed his Tonto character in a famous [[Stan Freberg]] Jeno's Pizza Rolls TV commercial opposite [[Clayton Moore]], and in ''[[The Phynx]]'', opposite [[John Hart (actor)|John Hart]], both having played The Lone Ranger in the original television series.

He appeared in three episodes of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Daniel Boone (TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'', starring [[Fess Parker]] as the real life frontiersman.

His later appearances included an episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', as an Indian who befriends the Bradys in the [[Grand Canyon]], and in an episode of the short-lived ''[[Dusty's Trail]]'', starring [[Bob Denver]] of ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''.

In the early 1960s, Silverheels supported the Indian Actors Workshop,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0884988.html|title= Silverheels was a spokesperson for Indian actors and in 1963 founded the Indian Actors Workshop.|publisher=Infoplease.com|accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}</ref> where American Indian actors refined their skills<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.famouscanadians.net/name/s/silverheelsjay.php |title=  He founded the Indian Actors' Workshop in 1966 with Will Sampson and offered free classes for Native Americans|publisher=Famouscanadians.net |accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}</ref> in [[Echo Park, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.celebhost.net/claytonmoore/jay.html |title=  He formed the Indian Actors Workshop in Echo Park in the late 1960s |publisher=Celebhost.net|accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}</ref> Today the workshop is firmly established.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jessicacrabtree.com/journal1/tag/jay-silverheels |title=  He later founded the Indian Actors Workshop, which he devoted enormous amounts of time and resources to. It still exists today.|publisher=Jessicacrabtree.com|accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Silverheels raised, bred and raced Standardbred horses in his spare time. Once, when asked about possibly running Tonto's famous [[Paint horse]] Scout in a race, Jay laughed off the idea: "Heck, ''I'' can outrun Scout!"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.tv.com/people/jay-silverheels/ |title= In the 70's he became a harness racing driver and bred horses.|publisher=Tv.com|accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}</ref>

Married in 1945, Silverheels was the father of three girls and a boy.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.filmreference.com/film/77/Jay-Silverheels.html |title= married, wife's name: Mary; children: Marilyn, Pamela, Karen, Jay Anthony|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}</ref>

==Death==
Silverheels suffered a stroke in 1976.<ref name="Cheryl Petten"/> The following year Moore rode a paint horse in Silverheels' honour.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Jay Silverheels died on March 5, 1980 from complications of a stroke at age sixty-seven in [[Calabasas, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.theloneranger.tv/tonto |title= Jay Silverheels suffered a stroke in 1974 and passed away on March 5, 1980 after several years of ill health|publisher=Theloneranger.tv |accessdate = 2011-11-21 }}</ref> He was cremated at [[Chapel of the Pines Crematory]], and his ashes were returned to the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario.<ref name="Cheryl Petten">{{cite web | title = Jay Silverheels: TV star paves way for Indian actors | author = Cheryl Petten | accessdate = 2015-03-08 | url= http://www.ammsa.com/sites/default/files/html-pages/old-site/buffalospirit/2004/footprints-JSilverheels.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150308055806/http://www.ammsa.com/sites/default/files/html-pages/old-site/buffalospirit/2004/footprints-JSilverheels.html | archivedate= 2015-03-08}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1993, Silverheels was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. He was named to the Western New York Entertainment Hall of Fame, and his portrait hangs in [[Buffalo, New York]]'s Shea's Buffalo Theatre. He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6538 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].   [[First Americans in the Arts]] honored Jay Silverheels with their Life Achievement Award.

In 1997, Silverheels was inducted, under the name Harry "Tonto" Smith, into the [[Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame]] in the Veteran Player category in recognition of his lacrosse career during the 1930s.
