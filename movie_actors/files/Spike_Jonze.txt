Jonze attended the [[San Francisco Art Institute]] in San Francisco, California.

[[File:SpikeJonze1SecondFilm.jpg|right|thumb|Jonze holding a producer credit for ''[[The 1 Second Film]]''.]]

Jonze has many alter egos, including Richard Koufey (alternately spelled Coufey or Couffe), the leader of the Torrance Community Dance Group, an urban troupe that performs in public spaces. The Koufey persona appeared when Jonze, in character, filmed himself dancing to [[Fatboy Slim]]'s "[[The Rockafeller Skank]]" as it played on a boom box in a public area.<ref name="Rockafeller Skank Audition">{{cite news|title=Rockafeller Skank (Spike Jonze Audition Demo Version)|author=[[Fatboy Slim]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=October 15, 2009|accessdate=March 24, 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89vjPKNEe1o}}</ref> Jonze showed the video to Slim, who appears briefly in the video around the 3:57 mark.<ref name="TheWorkofDirectorSpikeJonze">{{cite video | people = Landay, Vincent (Producer) Brown, Richard (Producer) | date = 2003 | title = The Work of Director Spike Jonze | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386124/ | medium = DVD | publisher = Palm Pictures | location = New York City | time = Side A, Commentry Track of Praise You spoken by Normal Cook (Fatboy Slim)}}</ref> Jonze then assembled a group of dancers to perform to Slim's "[[Praise You]]" outside a [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood, California]] movie theater and taped the performance. The resulting clip was a huge success, and "Koufey" and his troupe were invited to New York City to perform the song for the 1999 [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. The video received awards for Best Direction, Breakthrough, and Best Choreography, which Jonze accepted, still in character. Jonze made a [[mockumentary]] about the experience called ''[[Torrance Rises]]''.<ref name="imdb"/>

He has a speaking part along with [[Dave Eggers]] in the [[Beck]] song "The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton" from his 2006 album, ''[[The Information]]''. He appears in the "Exoskeleton" part.<ref name="moleskine">{{cite web|url=http://www.moleskine.com/events/detour/artists/spike_jonze.php |title=Spike Jonze-Moleskine |publisher=Moleskine.com |accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref>

Since 2007, he has been the creative director at [[VBS.tv]], an online television network supplied by ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' and funded by MTV.<ref name="vbs">{{cite web|title=Vice Music Chooses The Orchard|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/13/idUS170034+13-Jan-2009+BW20090113|work=Reuters|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=September 9, 2012|author=Business Wire|date=13 January 2009}}</ref>

Spike Jonze was part of the Detour-Moleskine project in New York in 2007.<ref name="moleskine" /> The project invites authors to compile and illustrate [[Moleskine]] notebooks to provide an intimate insight into the artists' creative process.

In 2008 he co-produced a new video for the Chocolate Skateboards "Easy Steady", direct by Ty Evans and Federico Vitetta in [[Milan]], featuring the song "Felicità" by [[Bugo]].<ref>{{cite av media|url=http://vimeo.com/18736819|title=Chocolate "Easy Steady"|work=Vimeo|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}</ref>

Jonze directed ''[[Where the Wild Things Are (film)|Where the Wild Things Are]]'',<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=23713 "Spike Jonze On Where The Wild Things Are"], ''Empire Online'' Fovember 19, 2008</ref> which opened in the United States on October 16, 2009. It was arguably his most anticipated film to date, the product of an almost decade long collaboration with author [[Maurice Sendak]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06jonze-t.html?scp=1&sq=jonze%20sendak&st=cse|title=Bringing 'Where the Wild Things Are' to the Screen|author=Saki Knafo|publisher=New York Times|date=September 6, 2009}}</ref> The film received generally favorable reviews, and appeared on many critics' end-of-the-year top ten lists.<ref name="toptenmcn">{{cite news|url=http://moviecitynews.com/2010/01/the-top-ten-chart-for-january-21-2010/|title=The Top Ten Chart For January 21, 2010|date=October 18, 1999|publisher=Movie City News|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}</ref>

In July 2009, Jonze acquired the rights to make a film adaptation of the [[Shane Jones (author)|Shane Jones]] novel ''Light Boxes''. However, Jonze, in an interview with Times Online, said that [[Ray Tintori]] was no longer a director for that project as expected.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article7126239.ece|title=A cure for Aids?

In 2010, he made a 28-minute short titled ''Scenes from the Suburbs'', inspired by the [[Arcade Fire]] album ''[[The Suburbs (Arcade Fire album)|The Suburbs]]''. Scenes from his short were used in the music video to the album's title song, "[[The Suburbs / Month of May|The Suburbs]]". A [[dystopian]] vision of suburbia in the near-future, the short was co-written by Jonze, [[Win Butler]], and Will Butler. Expanding on the themes of nostalgia, alienation, and childhood, the short premiered at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and saw its online premiere at MUBI on June 27, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scenes from the Suburbs|url=http://mubi.com/notebook/posts/watch-scenes-from-the-suburbs-for-free|publisher=MUBI|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

Jonze is good friends with [[Björk]] and frequently works with her. He has directed three videos for her and she contributed the theme song for Jonze's ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'' film.

Jonze is working on another project with the [[Beastie Boys]] for the release of their [[Santigold]] collaboration, "[[Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win]]." In a similar fashion to Jonze's recent work with Arcade Fire, he has directed both  "short and epic-length videos" to partner with the single.<ref>{{cite news|title=Spike Jonze to direct 'epic' Beastie Boys video|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/spike-jonze-to-direct-epic-beastie-boys-video-2307475.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=July 6, 2011|location=London|date=July 5, 2011}}</ref>

In 2011, Jonze directed the music video for "[[Otis (song)|Otis]]" the second single from the album ''[[Watch The Throne]]'' by [[Jay-Z]] and [[Kanye West]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Breihan|first=Tom|title=Spike Jonze to Direct Jay-Z/Kanye "Otis" Video|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/43397-spike-jonze-to-direct-jay-zkanye-otis-video/|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=November 3, 2013|date=August 1, 2011}}</ref> On November 3, 2013, Jonze directed the live music video for [[Arcade Fire]]'s "[[Afterlife (Arcade Fire song)|Afterlife]]" and documented [[Lady Gaga]]'s live performance of "Dope" with [[Chris Milk]] for the [[YouTube Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Spike Jonze to direct live music videos for Arcade Fire and Lady Gaga at YouTube Awards|url=http://www.nme.com/news/arcade-fire/73546|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|accessdate=November 3, 2013|date=October 31, 2013}}</ref>

Jonze's next theatrical project ''[[Her (film)|Her]]'' was released in late 2013.  ''[[Her (film)|Her]]'' is a science fiction romance film starring [[Joaquin Phoenix]], [[Amy Adams]], [[Olivia Wilde]], [[Rooney Mara]], and [[Scarlett Johansson]], and is Jonze's first feature-length original screenplay. The film follows a man (Phoenix) who develops a relationship with a seemingly intuitive and humanistic female voice, named "Samantha" (Johansson), produced by an advanced computer operating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/sony-spike-jonze-david-o-russell-movies-sandy-175820 |title=Sony Picks Up New Spike Jonze & David O.

==Personal life==
On June 26, 1999, Jonze married director [[Sofia Coppola]], whom he had first met in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0052190/|title=Jonze and Coppola Announce Divorce Plans|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}</ref> On December 5, 2003, the couple filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/2003-12-09-coppola-divorce_x.htm|title=Sofia Coppola, Spike Jonze to divorce|publisher=USA Today | date=December 9, 2003}}</ref> The character of John, a career-driven photographer ([[Giovanni Ribisi]]) in Coppola's ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' (2003), was rumored to be based on Jonze, though Coppola commented ”It’s not Spike, but there are elements of him there, elements of experiences".<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,490196,00.html "Sofia's Choice "], ''Entertainment Weekly'', October 3, 2003.</ref>

Jonze began dating [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] in July 2008, after the death of [[Heath Ledger]].
