==Early life==
Verdú was born in [[Madrid]], Spain. She began acting at 13, appearing in various commercials. She left school at the age of 15 so she could fully devote herself to her acting career. Verdú has appeared in more than 60 movies since [[1984 in film|1984]], the majority of them in Spanish. She has also been in numerous TV shows.

==Career==
Her first experience was as a model in ''spots'' and fashion magazines by known commercial firms.  Her first television opportunity was given to her at the age of 13 by [[Vicente Aranda]] in ''[[El Crimen del Capitán Sánchez|The Crime of Captain Sánchez]]''.

It was ''[[27 horas|27 Hours]]'', by [[Montxo Armendáriz]], about a girl who is a [[drug addict]], that was one of the most powerful experiences in her life up to that point.  It was the film where others started to notice her.  A little after this film other more important films started coming her way, which included ''[[La Estanquera de Vallecas]]'' by [[Eloy de la Iglesia]] and ''[[Year of Enlightment|El Año de las Luces]]'' by [[Fernando Trueba]].

Later Verdú said that her role in ''[[Amantes]]'' by [[Vicente Aranda]] marked a turning point in her screen career and has brought about a maturity as a performer.  Thereafter she has worked with some of the best Spanish directors: [[José Luis Garci]] in ''[[Canción de Cuna]]''; [[Bigas Luna]] in ''[[Huevos de Oro]]''; again with Trueba in the Oscar-nominated ''[[Belle Époque]]''; [[Emilio Martínez-Lázaro]] in ''[[Carreteras Secundarias]]''; [[Carlos Saura]] en ''[[Goya en Burdeos]]''; [[Gonzalo Suárez]] in ''[[El Portero]]'' and ''[[Oviedo Express]]'', amongst others.  On the international stage, her career hit a highpoint when she starred in ''[[Y Tu Mamá También]]'' by [[Alfonso Cuarón]], followed by ''[[El Laberinto del Fauno|Pan's Labyrinth]]'' by [[Guillermo del Toro]].  Following the movie ''Pan's Labyrinth'' Verdú has been invited to be a part of the Academy in Hollywood.
Maribel also stars in a music video named [[Lola Soledad]], by 16 time [[Latin Grammy Awards]] winner, [[Alejandro Sanz]] in 2010.

She made her theater debut in 1986 starring as the character of Julieta and has since then combined theater with cinema.  She has also intertwined the two in television shows such as ''[[Turno de Oficio]]'' and ''[[Segunda Enseñanza]]''.

===Awards===
Verdú has been nominated for the [[Goya Award]] on seven occasions.  Her first nomination came with the film ''[[Amantes]]'' by [[Vicente Aranda]], eventually losing to [[Sílvia Munt]] for her role in ''[[Alas de Mariposa]]''.  Her second nomination came for her casting role in ''[[La Celestina|The Celestine]]'' by [[Gerardo Vera]] but lost again to [[Mari Carrillo]] for ''[[Más Alla del Jardín]]''.  In ''[[La Buena Estrella]]'' by [[Ricardo Franco]] she achieved her third nomination, ultimately losing to [[Cecilia Roth]] in ''[[Martín Hache]]''.  In 2006 she received her fourth nomination with ''[[El Laberinto del Fauno|Pan's Labyrinth]]'' by [[Guillermo del Toro]], losing yet again to [[Penélope Cruz]].  Finally, on her fifth nomination, she won the [[Goya Awards|Goya Award]] for ''[[Siete Mesas de Billar Francés|Seven Billiard Tables]]''.  Apart from her Goya Award, Verdú possesses two Ondas Awards and two Silver Frame awards (between 7 nominations) as Best Television Actress for the series ''[[Canguros]]'' and as Best Actress for ''[[Los Girasoles Ciegos|The Blind Sunflowers]]'' by [[José Luis Cuerda]], for which she also received her sixth Goya nomination.  The following year she would be nominated again for the film ''[[Tetro]]'' by [[Francis Ford Coppola]].

She is also the only Spanish actress to win the [[Ariel Award]] in Mexico as Best Actress for ''Pan's Labyrinth''.

Maribel Verdú has also been close to awards in category A film festivals, such as the [[Berlin International Film Festival]].  In 1991 Verdú's casting partner, [[Victoria Abril]], raised the [[Silver Bear]] for Best Actress in ''[[Amantes]]''.
