'''Leonidas Frank "Lon" Chaney''' (April 1, 1883&nbsp;– August 26, 1930) was an American stage and film [[actor]], director and screenwriter. He is regarded as one of the most versatile and powerful actors of early cinema, renowned for his characterizations of tortured, often grotesque and afflicted characters, and his groundbreaking artistry with makeup.<ref name=obit/> Chaney is known for his starring roles in such silent [[horror film]]s as ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925). His ability to transform himself using makeup techniques he developed earned him the nickname "The Man of a Thousand Faces."

==Early life==
Leonidas Frank Chaney was born in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], to Frank H. Chaney and Emma Alice Kennedy; his father, was of [[English people|English]] and [[French people|French]] ancestry, and his mother was of Scottish, English, and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent. Chaney's maternal grandfather, Jonathan Ralston Kennedy, founded the "Colorado School for the Education of Mutes" (now, [[Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind]]) in 1874, and Chaney's parents met there.<ref>Kansas: A Cyclopedia of State History, Embracing Events, Institutions, Industries, Counties, Cities, Towns, Prominent Persons, etc. edited by Frank W. Blackmar c. 1912 pp.496–498</ref> Both of Chaney's parents were [[deaf]], and as a [[child of deaf adult]]s Chaney became skilled in [[Mime artist|pantomime]]. He entered a stage career in 1902, and began traveling with popular [[Vaudeville]] and theater acts. In 1905, Chaney, then 22, met and married 16-year-old singer Cleva Creighton (Frances Cleveland Creighton) and in 1906, their only child, a son, Creighton Tull Chaney (later known as [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]]) was born. The Chaneys continued touring, settling in [[California]] in 1910.

Marital troubles developed and on April 30, 1913, Cleva went to the Majestic Theater in downtown Los Angeles, where Lon was managing the ''[[Kolb and Dill]]'' show, and attempted [[suicide]] by swallowing [[Mercury(II) chloride|mercuric chloride]].<ref name=e>{{cite AV media | title=Mysteries and Scandals - Lon Chaney (Season 3, Episode 34) | publisher=E! | date=2000}}</ref> The suicide attempt failed but it ruined her singing career as a result; the ensuing scandal and divorce forced Chaney out of the theater and into [[film]].

The time spent there is not clearly known, but between the years 1912 and 1917, Chaney worked under contract for [[Universal Studios]] doing bit or character parts. His skill with makeup gained him many parts in the highly competitive casting atmosphere. During this time, Chaney befriended the husband-wife director team of [[Joe De Grasse]] and [[Ida May Park]], who gave him substantial roles in their pictures, and further encouraged him to play macabre characters.

Chaney married one of his former colleagues in the ''Kolb and Dill'' company tour, a chorus girl named Hazel Hastings. Little is known of Hazel, except that her marriage to Chaney was solid. Upon marrying, the new couple gained custody of Chaney's 10-year-old son Creighton, who had resided in various homes and [[boarding school]]s since Chaney's divorce from Cleva in 1913.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Mrs. Lon Chaney Dies.

==Career==
[[File:Ethel Grey Terry and Lon Chaney.jpg|right|thumb|''[[The Penalty (film)|The Penalty]]'' (1920)]]
[[File:Lon Chaney as Chinese immigrant Yen Sin in the film Shadows (1922).jpg|thumb|right|As a Chinese immigrant in ''[[Shadows (1922 film)|Shadows]]'' (1922)]]
[[File:Hunchback of Notre Dame.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923)]]
[[File:ChaneyPhantomoftheOpera.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925)]]
By 1917 Chaney was a prominent actor in the studio, but his salary did not reflect this status. When Chaney asked for a raise, studio executive [[William Sistrom]] replied, "You'll never be worth more than one hundred dollars a week." After leaving the studio, Chaney struggled for the first year as a character actor.  It was not until 1918 when playing a substantial role in [[William S. Hart]]'s picture, ''[[Riddle Gawne]]'', that Chaney's talents as a character actor were truly recognized by the industry.

In 1917 Universal presented Chaney, [[Dorothy Phillips]], and [[William Stowell]] as a team in ''[[The Piper's Price]]''.  In succeeding films, the men alternated playing lover, villain, or other man to the beautiful Phillips. They would occasionally be joined by [[Claire DuBrey]] nearly making the trio a quartet of recurring actors from film to film.  So successful were the films starring this group that Universal produced fourteen films from 1917 to 1919 with Chaney, Stowell, and Phillips. The films were usually directed by Joe De Grasse or his wife Ida May Park, both friends of Chaney's at Universal. When Chaney was away branching out on films such as ''[[Riddle Gawne]]'' and ''[[The Kaiser, Beast of Berlin]]'', Stowell and Phillips would continue on as a duo until Chaney's return. Stowell and Phillips made ''[[The Heart of Humanity]]'' (1918), bringing in [[Erich von Stroheim]] for a part as the villain that could easily have been played by Chaney. ''Paid in Advance'' (1919) was the group's last film together, for the chiseled featured Stowell was sent to Africa by Universal to scout locations for a movie.  En route from one city to another, Stowell was in the [[caboose]] when it was hit by the locomotive from another train; he was killed instantly.  The majority of these films are lost but a few, including ''Triumph'' and ''Paid in Advance'' survive in private collections or unrestored in European or Russian archives.<ref>Internet Movie Database,IMDb.com ; film listings on ''Lon Chaney, William Stowell, Dorothy Phillips & Claire Dubrey''</ref><ref>''Pictorial History of the Silent Screen'', by Daniel Blum c. 1953 p.141; scene from ''Triumph'' (1917), description ...''Phillips has hand on Chaney's head embracing him while Stowell reads paperwork on desk''</ref>

In 1919, Chaney had a breakthrough performance as "The Frog" in [[George Loane Tucker]]'s ''[[The Miracle Man (1919 film)|The Miracle Man]]''. The film displayed not only Chaney's acting ability, but also his talent as a master of makeup. Critical praise and a gross of over $2&nbsp;million put Chaney on the map as America's foremost [[character actor]].

He exhibited great adaptability with makeup in more conventional crime and adventure films, such as ''[[The Penalty (film)|The Penalty]]'' (1920), in which he played an amputee gangster. Chaney appeared in ten films directed by [[Tod Browning]], often portraying disguised and/or mutilated characters, including carnival knife-thrower Alonzo the Armless in ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]'' (1927) opposite [[Joan Crawford]]. In 1927, Chaney also co-starred with [[Conrad Nagel]], [[Marceline Day]], [[Henry B. Walthall]] and [[Polly Moran]] in the Tod Browning horror film, ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]'', considered one of the most legendary and sought after [[lost film]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Michelle|title=Olive Borden: The Life and Films of Hollywood's "Joy Girl"|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-44795-8|page=146}}</ref> His final film role was a [[talkie|sound]] remake of his silent classic ''[[The Unholy Three (1930 film)|The Unholy Three]]'' (1930), his only "[[talkie]]" and the only film in which Chaney utilized his versatile voice. Chaney signed a sworn statement declaring that five of the key voices in the film (the ventriloquist, the old woman, a parrot, the dummy and the girl) were his own.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Herzogenrath, Bernd |title=The Cinema of Tod Browning: Essays of the Macabre and Grotesque|year=2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-43447-3|page=79}}</ref>

As [[Quasimodo]], the bell ringer of Notre Dame, and [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik, the "phantom"]] of the Paris Opera House, Chaney created two of the most grotesquely deformed characters in film history.<ref name="sag">[http://www.silentsaregolden.com/featurefolder2/phantomfeature3.html Silents are Golden]</ref><ref name="uni">Dick, Bernard F., ''City of Dreams: The Making and Remaking of Universal Pictures.'' [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]: The University Press of Kentucky, 1997, pp. 52-55</ref>  However, the portrayals sought to elicit a degree of sympathy and pathos among viewers not overwhelmingly terrified or repulsed by the monstrous disfigurements of these victims of fate.

In a 1925 autobiographical article for ''Movie'' magazine, Chaney wrote, "I wanted to remind people that the lowest types of humanity may have within them the capacity for supreme self-sacrifice. The [[dwarfism|dwarfed]], misshapen beggar of the streets may have the noblest ideals. Most of my roles since ''The Hunchback,'' such as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[He Who Gets Slapped]]'', ''[[The Unholy Three (1930 film)|The Unholy Three]],'' etc., have carried the theme of self-sacrifice or renunciation. These are the stories which I wish to do." Chaney referred to his expertise in both make-up and contorting his body to portray his subjects as "extraordinary characterization." Chaney's talents extended beyond the horror genre and stage makeup. He was also a highly skilled dancer, singer and comedian.

[[Ray Bradbury]] once said of Chaney, "He was someone who acted out our [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]s. He somehow got into the shadows inside our bodies; he was able to nail down some of our secret fears and put them on-screen. The history of Lon Chaney is the history of unrequited loves. He brings that part of you out into the open, because you fear that you are not loved, you fear that you never will be loved, you fear there is some part of you that's grotesque, that the world will turn away from."

[[File:Lon Chaney as Mr Wu.png|left|thumb|125px|As "[[Mr. Wu]]," conducting an orchestra of women.]]

Chaney and his second wife Hazel led a discreet private life distant from the Hollywood social scene. Chaney did minimal promotional work for his films and for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], purposefully fostering a mysterious image, and he reportedly intentionally avoided the social scene in Hollywood.<ref name="fleming">{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=E.J.|title=Paul Bern: The Life and Famous Death of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Director and Husband of Harlow|year=2009|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-45274-9|page=167}}</ref>

In the final five years of his film career (1925–1930), Chaney worked exclusively under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, giving some of his most memorable performances.  His portrayal of a tough-as-nails marine drill instructor in ''[[Tell It to the Marines (film)|Tell It to the Marines]]'' (1926), one of his favorite films, earned him the affection of the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], who made him their first [[Honorary Marine|honorary member]] from the motion picture industry. He also earned the respect and admiration of numerous aspiring actors, to whom he offered mentoring assistance, and between takes on film sets he was always willing to share his professional observations with the cast and crew.

==Death==
[[File:Lon chaney c1923.jpg|right|thumb|1923 Lon Chaney portrait]]
During the filming of ''[[Thunder (film)|Thunder]]'' in the winter of 1929, Chaney developed [[pneumonia]]. In late 1929 he was diagnosed with bronchial [[lung cancer]]. This was exacerbated when artificial snow, made out of cornflakes, lodged in his throat during filming and quickly created a serious infection.<ref name="Schickel">{{Cite book|title=The Stars |last=Schickel |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Schickel |year=1962 |publisher=Bonanza Books, a division of Crown Publishers, Inc. |location=New York |isbn= |page=133}}</ref>  Despite aggressive treatment, his condition gradually worsened, and seven weeks after the release of the remake of ''[[The Unholy Three (1930 film)|The Unholy Three]]'', he died of a throat hemorrhage on August 26, 1930 in [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref name=obit>{{Cite news|title=Lon Chaney Dies After Brave Fight.

[[File:ChaneyHighSierraHouseFrontView.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Lon Chaney High Sierra House]]
In 1957, Chaney was the subject of a biopic titled ''[[Man of a Thousand Faces]]'', and was portrayed by [[James Cagney]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Slide|first=Anthony|authorlink=Anthony Slide|title=Silent Players: A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film Actors and Actresses |year=2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-813-13745-4|page=217}}</ref> The film is a largely fictionalized account as Chaney was notoriously private and hated the Hollywood lifestyle. He never revealed personal details about himself or his family, once stating "Between pictures, there is no Lon Chaney."<ref name="fleming"/>

Lon Chaney has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] located on [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/lon-chaney/|title=Lon Chaney|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}</ref>

In 1994, [[Al Hirschfeld]]'s caricature of Chaney was featured on a commemorative [[List of people on stamps of the United States|United States postage stamp]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blake|first=Michael F.|title=A Thousand Faces: Lon Chaney's Unique Artistry in Motion Pictures|year=1997|publisher=Vestal Press|isbn=1-461-73076-7|page=290}}</ref>

The stage theater at the Colorado Springs Civic Auditorium is named after Chaney.

In 1929, Chaney built a stone cabin in the remote wilderness of the eastern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], near [[Big Pine, California]], as a retreat.  The cabin (designed by architect [[Paul Williams (architect)|Paul Williams]]) still stands, and is preserved by the [[Inyo National Forest|Inyo National Forest Service]].

Following his death, Chaney's famous makeup case was donated to the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Los Angeles County Museum]] by his widow Hazel. The case is occasionally displayed for the public.

Chaney and his son are mentioned in the [[Warren Zevon]] song "[[Werewolves of London]]".

Chaney is the subject of the 2000 [[documentary]] feature, ''Lon Chaney: A Thousand Faces''. The film was produced by silent film historian [[Kevin Brownlow]] and narrated by [[Kenneth Branagh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/05/phantom-opera-lon-chaney-1925|title=The Phantom of the Opera|last=French|first=Phillip|date=January 4, 2014|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}</ref>
