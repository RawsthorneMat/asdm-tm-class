'''William Wyler''' (July 1, 1902 – July 27, 1981) was a German-born American film director, producer and screenwriter.<ref name="Herman p. 37">Herman 1995, p. 37.</ref> Notable works included ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1946), and ''[[Mrs. Miniver (film)|Mrs. Miniver]]'' (1942), all of which won Wyler Academy Awards for Best Director, as well as Best Picture in their respective years, making him the only director of three Best Picture winners. Wyler received his first Oscar nomination for directing ''[[Dodsworth (film)|Dodsworth]]'' in 1936, starring [[Walter Huston]], [[Ruth Chatterton]] and [[Mary Astor]], "sparking a 20-year run of almost unbroken greatness."<ref>Freer 2009, p. 24.</ref>

Film historian [[Ian Freer]] calls Wyler a "[[bona fide]] perfectionist", whose penchant for retakes and an attempt to hone every last nuance, "became the stuff of legend."<ref name=Freer>Freer 2009, p. 57.</ref> His ability to direct a string of classic literary adaptations into huge box-office and critical successes made him one of "Hollywood's most bankable moviemakers" during the 1930s and 1940s and into the 60's. Other popular Wyler films include ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' (1968), ''[[How to Steal a Million]]'' (1966), ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'' (1961), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' (1953), ''[[The Heiress]]'' (1949), ''[[The Letter (1940 film)|The Letter]]'' (1940), ''[[The Westerner (film)|The Westerner]]'' (1940), ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' (1939), ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]'' (1938), ''[[Dodsworth (film)|Dodsworth]]'' (1936), and ''[[Hell's Heroes (film)|Hell's Heroes]]'' (1930).

==Early life==
Wyler was born<ref name="son David William Wyler">son David William Wyler</ref> to a [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] family<ref name=Wakeman>Wakeman 1987, p. 1220.</ref> in [[Mulhouse]], [[Alsace]] (then part of the [[German Empire]]).<ref>Madsen 1973, p. 3.</ref> His [[Swiss nationality law|Swiss]] father, Leopold, started as a traveling salesman which he later turned into a thriving [[haberdasher]]y business in Mulhouse. His mother, Melanie (née Auerbach;<ref>http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-02119.html</ref> died February 13, 1955, Los Angeles, aged 77), was [[German nationality law|German]], and a cousin of [[Carl Laemmle]], founder of [[Universal Pictures]]. During Wyler's childhood, he attended a number of schools and developed a reputation as "something of a hellraiser", being expelled more than once for misbehavior.<ref>Wakeman 1987, p. 1222.</ref> His mother often took him and his older brother Robert to concerts, opera, and the theatre, as well as the early cinema. Sometimes at home his family and their friends would stage amateur theatricals for personal enjoyment.<ref>Wakeman 1987, p. 1223.</ref>

Wyler was supposed to take over the family business. After [[World War I]] he spent a dismal year working in Paris at 100.000 Chemises selling shirts and ties. He was so poor that he often spent his time wandering around the [[Place Pigalle|Pigalle]] district. After realizing that Willy was not interested in the haberdashery business, his mother contacted her distant cousin about opportunities for him. Laemmle was in the habit of coming to Europe each year, searching for promising young men who would work in America. In 1921, Wyler, while traveling as a [[Swiss nationality law|Swiss citizen]] (his father's status automatically conferred Swiss citizenship to his sons), met Laemmle who hired him to work at [[Universal Studios]] in New York. As Wyler said: "America seemed as far away as the moon." Booked onto a ship to New York with Laemmle upon his return voyage, he met a young Czech man, [[Paul Kohner]] (later the famous independent agent), aboard the same ship. Their enjoyment of the first class trip was short-lived as they found they had to pay back the cost of the passage out of their $25 weekly income as messengers to Universal Pictures. After working in New York for several years, and even serving in the New York National Guard for a year, Wyler decided he wanted to go to Hollywood and be a director.<ref name="Herman p. 37"/>

==Film career==
Around 1923, Wyler arrived in Los Angeles and began work on the Universal Studios lot in the [[swing gang]], cleaning the stages and moving the sets. His break came when he was hired as a second assistant editor. His work ethic was uneven with [[Irving Thalberg]] nicknaming him "Worthless Willy." After some ups and downs (including getting fired), he focused on becoming a director. He started as a third assistant director and by 1925 he became the youngest director on the Universal lot directing the Westerns that Universal was famed for turning out. In 1928, he became a [[naturalized]] United States citizen.<ref>Madsen 1973, p. 73.</ref>

He directed his first non-Western, the lost ''[[Anybody Here Seen Kelly?]]'', in 1928. This was followed by his first part-talkie films, ''[[The Shakedown (1929 film)|The Shakedown]]'' and ''[[The Love Trap]]''. He proved himself an able craftsman, and in the early 1930s began directing such films as ''[[Hell's Heroes (film)|Hell's Heroes]]'', ''[[Tom Brown of Culver]]'', and ''[[The Good Fairy (film)|The Good Fairy]]''. He became well known for his insistence on multiple retakes, resulting in often award-winning and critically acclaimed performances from his actors. After leaving Universal he began a long collaboration with [[Samuel Goldwyn]] for whom he directed such classics as ''[[Dodsworth (film)|Dodsworth]]'' (1936), ''[[These Three]]'' (1936), ''[[Dead End (1937 film)|Dead End]]'' (1937), ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' (1939), ''[[The Westerner (film)|The Westerner]]'' (1940), ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' (1941) and ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1946). {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

[[Laurence Olivier]], whom Wyler directed in ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' for his first-ever Oscar nomination, credited Wyler with teaching him how to act for the screen, despite clashing with Wyler on multiple occasions. Olivier would go on to hold the record for the most nominations in the Best Actor category at nine, tied with [[Spencer Tracy]]. In 1950, Wyler and Olivier made a second film together, ''[[Carrie (1952 film)|Carrie]]'', which was not a commercial success.  Bette Davis received three Oscar nominations for her screen work under Wyler, and won her second Oscar for her performance in Wyler's 1938 film ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]''. [[Charlton Heston]] won his only nomination and Best Actor Oscar for his work in Wyler's 1959 ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''. [[Barbra Streisand]] won 1968's Best Actress Oscar (as did [[Katharine Hepburn]] for ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'', in the only tie in Oscar history for this category) as entertainer [[Fanny Brice]] in Streisand's debut film, ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]''. [[Audrey Hepburn]] won an Oscar in her debut performance in ''[[Roman Holiday]]''. Fourteen actors won Oscars under Wyler's direction. In 1941, Wyler directed ''[[Mrs. Miniver (film)|Mrs. Miniver]]'', a story of a middle class English family adjusting to the war in Europe. ''Mrs. Miniver'' won Wyler his first Academy Award for Best Director, as well as another five Oscars.

A perfectionist, Wyler earned the nickname "90-take Wyler". On the set of ''Jezebel'', Wyler forced [[Henry Fonda]] through 40 takes of one particular scene, his only guidance being "Again!" after each take. When Fonda asked for more direction, Wyler responded, "It stinks." Similarly, when [[Charlton Heston]] quizzed the director about the supposed shortcomings of his performance in ''Ben-Hur'', Wyler simply told Heston to<ref name="son David William Wyler"/> "Be better."<ref>[http://www.palzoo.net/William-Wyler Wyler profile at palzoo.net] Retrieved November 12, 2011.</ref>

==World War II==
Between 1942 and 1945, Wyler, who became a United States citizen in 1928, served as a major in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and directed three documentaries: ''[[The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress]]'' (1944), the story of a Boeing B-17 and its U.S. Army Air Force crew, ''[[Thunderbolt!]]'' (1947), with [[Lester Koenig]] and [[John Sturges]], the story of a P-47 fighter-bomber squadron in the Mediterranean.<ref name="son David William Wyler"/> Wyler filmed ''The Memphis Belle'' at great personal risk, flying over enemy territory on actual bombing missions in 1943; on one flight, Wyler passed out from lack of oxygen.  Wyler's associate, cinematographer Harold J. Tannenbaum, was shot down and perished during the filming.<ref>Kozloff, Sarah. "Wyler's wars.", ''Film History'', April 20, 2008.</ref>{{page needed|date=November 2011}} Working on "[[Thunderbolt]]" Wyler was exposed to such loud sound that he passed out. When he awoke, he found he was deaf. Later partial hearing came back in his left ear.<ref>David William Wyler</ref> Wyler returned from the War a disabled veteran.<ref name="Mark Harris' Five Came Back">Mark Harris' Five Came Back</ref>

Returning from the War and unsure whether he could work again, Wyler turned to a subject that he knew well and <ref name="Mark Harris' Five Came Back"/> directed a film which captured the mood of the nation as it turned to peace after the war, ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1946). This story of the homecoming of three veterans from World War II dramatized the problems of returning veterans in their adjustment back to civilian life. Arguably his most personal film, ''Best Years'' drew on Wyler's own experience returning home to his family after three years on the front. ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] (Wyler's second) and [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], as well as seven other Academy Awards.

==Postwar career==
During the immediate postwar period, Wyler directed a handful of critically acclaimed and influential films. In 1949, he directed ''[[The Heiress]]'', which earned [[Olivia de Havilland]] her second Oscar and garnered additional Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Music. ''[[Roman Holiday (1953 film)|Roman Holiday]]'' (1953) introduced [[Audrey Hepburn]] to American audiences and led to Oscars for Best Actress (Hepburn), Costume Design ([[Edith Head]]), and Best Writing (Dalton Trumbo). ''[[Friendly Persuasion (film)|Friendly Persuasion]]'' (1956) was awarded the [[Palme d'Or]] (Golden Palm) at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. In 1959, Wyler directed ''Ben-Hur'', which won 11 Oscars (a feat equalled only by ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' in 1997 and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' in 2003). Wyler won his third Academy Award for Best Director for ''Ben-Hur''.

Wyler's films garnered more awards for participating artists and actors than any other director in the history of Hollywood. He received 12 Oscar nominations for Best Director in total, while dozens of his collaborators and actors won Oscars or were nominated. In 1965, Wyler won the [[Irving Thalberg]] Award for career achievement. Eleven years later, he received the [[American Film Institute]] Life Achievement Award. In addition to his Best Picture and Best Director Oscar wins, 13 of Wyler's films earned Best Picture nominations. Other late Wyler films include ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'', ''[[The Collector]]'', ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'', and his final film, ''[[The Liberation of L.B. Jones]]''.

On July 24, 1981, Wyler gave an interview with his daughter, Catherine, for ''Directed by William Wyler'', a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary about his life and career. Three days later, he died from a heart attack. He is interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale, California]].<ref>{{Find a Grave|5005}}</ref>

==Marriages==
Wyler was briefly married to [[Margaret Sullavan]] (November 25, 1934 – March 13, 1936) and married [[Margaret Tallichet|Margaret "Talli" Tallichet]] on October 23, 1938. The couple remained together until his death; they had five children: Catherine, Judith, William Jr., Melanie and David.

==Awards==
Wyler is the most nominated director in Academy Awards history with 12 nominations. In addition to that, Wyler has the distinction of having won the Academy Award for Best Direction on three occasions, for his direction of ''Ben Hur'', ''The Best Years of Our Lives'', and ''Mrs. Miniver''. He is tied with [[Frank Capra]] and behind [[John Ford]], who won four Oscars in this category.

Wyler also has the distinction of having directed more actors to Oscar-nominated performances than any other director in history: thirty-six.  Out of these nominees, fourteen went on to win Oscars.[http://www.altfg.com/blog/actors/william-wyler-top-oscar-directors-for-actors-i/]

William Wyler received the fourth AFI LIfe Achievement Award in 1976.
