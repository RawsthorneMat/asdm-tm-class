'''Robert J. Wilke''' (May 18, 1914 – March 28, 1989) was a prolific American film and television actor noted primarily for his roles as villains, mostly in [[Western (genre)|Western]]s.

Wilke started as a stuntman in the 1930s and his first appearance on screen was in ''San Francisco'' (1936). He soon began to acquire regular character parts, mainly as a heavy, and made his mark when, along with [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Sheb Wooley]], he played one of the "three men waiting at the station" in ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952).

A western "bad guy", Wilke was among those actors who fall into the "man with no name" category. While his face was instantly recognizable, few cinemagoers actually knew his name.

==Television westerns==

Unlike ''[[Lee Van Cleef]]'', Wilke never got the "big break" but did appear on many if not most television westerns, including seven episodes each of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'' and  [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.

Wilke appeared eight times from 1951 to 1953 on the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] western series ''[[The Range Rider]]'', starring [[Jock Mahoney]] and [[Dick Jones (actor)|Dick Jones]].

In 1960, Wilke was cast as Red Dog Hanlon in the episode "End of a Dream" of the NBC western series, ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'', starring [[Darren McGavin]] and [[Noah Beery, Jr.]] In the story line, [[Cliff Robertson]], as the con man Martinius Van Der Brig persuades series character Grey Holden (McGavin) to transport by riverboat a group of pioneers to "Rolling Stone", a tract of land which he recently purchased that cannot match the expectations of the settlers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0687086/|title="End of a Dream", ''Riverboat'',  September 19, 1960|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=February 21, 2013}}</ref>

Wilke's final film role was somewhat against type as General Barnicke in the 1981 comedy ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]''.

==Golf==
Wilke was an excellent golfer.  Author Dan Jenkins, in his book ''The Dogged Victims of Inexorable Fate'', describes a golf match at Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles:
<blockquote>
Mr. Wilke joined Mr. Jenkins, [[Vic Damone]], [[James Garner]], [[Jack Ging]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Donald O'Connor]], and [[Lindsay Crosby]] in the first and only Sports Illustrated Open Invitation at Riviera.  The pro at Riviera at the time, Mac Hunter, is quoted as saying, "Bob Wilke used to be head and shoulders better than any of the actors and personalities. And he's still very good. A solid four handicap, but his putting is deteriorating. Wilke must have won more celebrity tournaments than you can count.<ref name=djenkins/></blockquote>

Jack Ging edged out Bob Wilke for the win that day.<ref name=djenkins>{{cite book |author=Jenkins, Dan |year=1970 |page=???? |chapter=5: "Lights...Camera...Double Bogey" |title=The Dogged Victims of Inexorable Fate |publisher=Fireside/[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=9780671667504 }}</ref>  [[James Garner]] also said that Wilke was the best golfer among the showbiz crowd at the Riviera in his book ''The Garner Files''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Garner, James; [[Jon Winokur]] |year=2011 |page=159 |title=The Garner Files: A Memoir |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=978-1-4516-4260-5 |oclc=709673421 }}</ref>
