'''Joel Albert McCrea''' (November 5, 1905 &ndash; October 20, 1990) was an American actor whose career spanned 50 years and appearances in over 90 films.

==Early life==
[[File:Most Dangerous Game prey.jpg|left|thumb|With [[Fay Wray]] in ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (1932 film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' (1932)]]
McCrea was born in [[South Pasadena, California]], the son of Thomas McCrea, who was an executive with the L.A. Gas & Electric Company.<ref name=tcmbio>{{tcmdb name|126737}}</ref> As a boy, he had a paper route, and delivered the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' to [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and other people in the film industry.  He also had the opportunity to watch [[D. W. Griffith]] filming ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', and was an extra in a serial starring [[Ruth Roland]].<ref name=tcmbio /><ref name=amgbio>Erickson, Hal [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=2:47163~T0 Biography (Allmovie)]</ref>

McCrea graduated from [[Hollywood High School]] and then [[Pomona College]] (class of 1928<ref>Pomona College Alumni Directory, 2000, p. 294.</ref>), where he had acted on stage and took courses in drama and public speaking, while appearing regularly at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]],<ref name=tcmbio /><ref name=amgbio />  Even as a high school student, he was working as a stunt double<ref name=amgbio /> and held horses for cowboy stars [[William S. Hart]] and [[Tom Mix]].<ref name=tcmbio /> He worked as an extra, stunt man and bit player from 1927 to 1928, when he signed a contract with [[MGM]], where he was cast in a major role in ''[[The Jazz Age (1929 film)|The Jazz Age]]'' (1929), and got his first leading role that same year, in ''[[The Silver Horde (1930 film)|The Silver Horde]]''.<ref name=tcmbio />  He moved to [[RKO]] in 1930, where he established himself as a handsome leading man who was considered versatile enough to star in both dramas and comedies.

==Career==
[[File:Foreign Correspondent trailer 16 McCrea crop.jpg|thumb|left|275px|in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940)]]
In the 1930s, McCrea starred in ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932), directed by [[King Vidor]], causing controversy for his nude scenes with [[Dolores del Río]]. In RKO's ''[[The Sport Parade]]'' (1932), McCrea and [[William Gargan]] are friends on the Dartmouth football team, who are shown snapping towels at each other in the locker room, while other players are taking a shower. In 1932 he starred with Fay Wray in ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' - which used some of the same jungle sets built for ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' as well as cast members Wray and [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]].

In 1934, he made his first appearances with two leading ladies he would be paired with often: with [[Miriam Hopkins]] he made ''[[The Richest Girl in the World]]'', the first of their five films together,<ref>McCrea and Hopkins appeared together in ''[[The Richest Girl in the World]]'' (1934), ''[[Barbary Coast (film)|Barbary Coast]]'' (1935), ''[[Splendor (1935 film)|Splendor]]'' (1935), ''[[These Three]]'' (1936) and ''[[Woman Chases Man]]'' (1937).</ref> and with [[Barbara Stanwyck]] he appeared in ''[[Gambling Lady]]'', the first of their six films.<ref>McCrea and Stanwyck appeared together in ''[[Gambling Lady]]'' (1934), ''[[Banjo on My Knee (film)|Banjo on My Knee]]'' (1936), ''[[Internes Can't Take Money]]'' (1937), ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' (1939), ''[[The Great Man's Lady]]'' (1942) and ''[[Trooper Hook]]'' (1957).</ref> Later in the decade, he was the first actor to play "Dr. Kildare", in the film ''[[Internes Can't Take Money]]'' (1937), and he starred in two large-scale Westerns, ''[[Wells Fargo (film)|Wells Fargo]]'' (1937) with his wife [[Frances Dee]], and Cecil B. DeMille's ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' (1939).

McCrea reached the peak of his early career in the early 1940s, in such films as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s  ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940), ''[[The More the Merrier]]'' (1943) directed by [[George Stevens]], and two by [[Preston Sturges]]: ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' (1941) and ''[[The Palm Beach Story]]'' (1942).<ref>McCrea also appeared in Sturges' ''[[The Great Moment (1944 film)|The Great Moment]]'', which was filmed in 1942 but not released until 1944 because of studio interference. The film was not a success, and marked a decline in Sturges' career.</ref>

McCrea also starred in two [[William A. Wellman]] westerns, ''[[The Great Man's Lady]]'' (1942), again with Stanwyck, and ''[[Buffalo Bill (film)|Buffalo Bill]]'' (1944), with character actor [[Edgar Buchanan]] and a young [[Maureen O'Hara]].  After the success of ''[[The Virginian (1946 film)|The Virginian]]'' in 1946, McCrea made Westerns exclusively for the rest of his career, with the exception of the British-made ''[[Rough Shoot]]'' (1953).

Performing in Westerns was a return to what he had done earlier in his career, and McCrea enjoyed the genre.  In a 1978 interview, he said: <blockquote>I liked doing comedies, but as I got older I was better suited to do Westerns. Because I think it becomes unattractive for an older fellow trying to look young, falling in love with attractive girls in those kinds of situations...Anyway, I always felt so much more comfortable in the Western. The minute I got a horse and a hat and a pair of boots on, I felt easier. I didn't feel like I was an actor anymore. I felt like I was the guy out there doing it.<ref name=tcmbio /></blockquote>

In the early 1950s, McCrea starred as Jayce Pearson on the radio series western, ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]''.

==Later career==
In {{ytv|1959}}, Joel McCrea and his son [[Jody McCrea]] starred in the [[NBC-TV]] series ''[[Wichita Town]]'', which lasted only one season.  A few years later, McCrea united with fellow veteran of westerns [[Randolph Scott]] in ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]], after which he did not make another feature film until ''[[The Young Rounders]]'' (1966).  Four more years were to pass before his next film, but 1970 saw the release of two films: ''[[Cry Blood, Apache]]'', again with his son Jody, and ''[[Sioux Nation]].''  McCrea made his final film appearance in 1976, in ''[[Mustang Country]]''.

In 1968, McCrea received a career achievement award from the L.A. Film Critics Association,<ref>Allmovie [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=2:47163~T3 Awards]</ref> and the following year he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Joel McCrea has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6901 Hollywood Blvd. and another star at 6241 Hollywood Blvd. for his contribution to radio.

==Personal life==
McCrea married actress [[Frances Dee]] in 1933, after they met while filming ''[[The Silver Cord (film)|The Silver Cord]]''.<ref name=tcmbio /><ref>McCrea and Dee appeared together in six films: ''[[The Silver Cord]]'' (1933), ''[[One Man's Journey]]'' (1933), ''[[Come and Get It (film)|Come and Get It]]'' (1936), ''[[Wells Fargo (film)|Wells Fargo]]'' (1937), ''[[Four Faces West]]'' (1948) and ''[[Cattle Drive]]'' (1951).</ref> The couple had three children, David, who became a rancher; Peter, who became a real estate developer; and [[Jody McCrea|Jody]], who became an actor.<ref name=tcmbio /> Joel and Frances remained married until his death — spending 57 years together.

According to David Ragan's ''Stars of the '30s'', the McCreas were prodigious savers, accumulating a large estate, which included working-ranch properties. Joel McCrea's work ethic was in part attributed to his Scottish heritage and it also may have stemmed from his friendship in the 1930s with fellow personality and sometime actor, [[Will Rogers]]. McCrea recounted that "the Oklahoma Sage" gave him a profound piece of advice: "Save half of what you make, and live on just the other half."<ref>Raban, David ''Stars of the '30s''</ref>

McCrea &ndash; who was an outdoorsman who had once listed his occupation as "rancher" and his hobby as "acting" &ndash; had begun buying property as early as 1933, when he purchased his first {{convert|1000|acre|km2}} in a then-unincorporated area of eastern [[Ventura County, California]], which later became [[Thousand Oaks, California]].  This was the beginning of what became a {{convert|3000|acre|km2|sing=on}} spread on which McCrea and his wife Frances lived, raised their children, and rode their horses.<ref name=tcmbio />

By the end of the 1940s, McCrea was a multi-millionaire, as much from his real-estate dealings as from his movie stardom.  In the late 1960s, he sold {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} of land to an oil company, on the condition that they would not drill within sight of his home.<ref name=amgbio />

The McCreas ultimately donated several hundred acres of their personal property to the newly formed Conejo Valley [[YMCA]] for the city of [[Thousand Oaks, California]]. Today, the Conejo Valley YMCA is located in "Joel McCrea Park".

Joel McCrea made his final public appearance on October 3, 1990, at a fundraiser for Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Pete Wilson]] in [[Beverly Hills]].<ref name=tcmbio />  He died less than three weeks later, on October 20, in [[Woodland Hills, California]] from [[pneumonia]], at the age of 84.
