'''Jack Palance''' (born '''Volodymyr Palahniuk'''; February 18, 1919 – November 10, 2006) was an American actor. During half a century of film and television appearances, Palance was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]], all for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]], winning in 1991 for his role in ''[[City Slickers]]''.

==Early life==
Palance was born Volodymyr Palahniuk on February 18, 1919  in the [[Lattimer Mines, Pennsylvania|Lattimer Mines]] section of [[Hazle Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Hazle Township]], [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]], to Anna ({{née}} Gramiak) and Ivan Palahniuk, an [[anthracite]] coal miner.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/63/Jack-Palance.html Jack Palance Biography (1920?-)]</ref> Palance's parents were [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] immigrants,<ref>[http://www.ukemonde.com/palance/last_role.html The Last Role of an American "City Slicker" with a Ukrainian Soul]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6138310.stm BBC NEWS | Entertainment | Veteran western star Palance dies]</ref> his father a native of Ivane Zolote in southwestern Ukraine (modern [[Ternopil Oblast]]) and his mother from the [[Lviv Oblast]].<ref>[http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/2006/470609.shtml OBITUARY: Academy Award-winning actor Jack Palance, 87 (11/19/06)]</ref>

One of six children, he worked in coal mines during his youth before becoming a professional [[boxing|boxer]] in the late 1930s. Fighting under the name ''Jack Brazzo'', Palance reportedly compiled a record of 15 consecutive victories with 12 [[knockout]]s before losing a close decision to future [[heavyweight]] contender [[Joe Baksi]] in a "Pier-6" brawl.<ref>[http://www.boxrec.com/boxer_display.php?boxer_id=041420 Boxing Records] Official records only show Palance in one sanctioned fight.

He was an outstanding high school football player and this skill was recognized by [[Raymond Wolf]], the Head Coach at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. Palance began his career at Carolina as a [[fullback (American football)|fullback]], but Coach Wolf and the staff felt that he was best-suited to play in the line and, after some consideration, Palance left the game for good.<ref>[http://alumni.unc.edu/article.aspx?sid=572][[Furman Bisher]], a UNC-Chapel Hill alumnus recollected seeing Palance contemplating whether or not football was his future after being asked to switch positions.</ref>

With the outbreak of [[World War II]], Palance's athletic career ended and his military career began as a member of the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. Palance's rugged face, which took many beatings in the boxing ring, was said to have become disfigured while bailing out of a burning [[B-24 Liberator]] bomber during a training flight over southern [[Arizona]] (where Palance was a student [[military aviation|pilot]]).   His distinctive cheekbones and deep-set eyes<ref>http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2007/janfeb/dept/palance.html</ref> were said to have been the result of reconstructive surgery.  The story behind Palance's face was repeated numerous times (including in respected film reference works), but upon his death, several obituaries of Palance quoted him as saying that the entire story had been contrived: "Studio press agents make up anything they want to, and reporters go along with it. One flack created the legend that I had been blown up in an air crash during the war, and my face had to be put back together by way of plastic surgery.  If it is a 'bionic face,' why didn't they do a better job of it?"

Palance was honorably discharged from the Army Air Corps in 1944.  After the war he attended [[Stanford University]], leaving one credit shy of graduating to pursue a career in the theatre. (A bachelor of arts degree in Drama was conferred to him, honorary Class of '49, in ’95)<ref>http://humsci.stanford.edu/about/accomplished_alumni</ref> During his university years, to make ends meet he also worked as a [[short order cook]], [[waiter]], [[soda jerk]], [[lifeguard]] at [[Jones Beach State Park]], and photographer's model.

Palance's last name was actually a derivative of his original name. In an episode of "What's my line?" he describes how no one could pronounce his last name and it was suggested he be called Palanski. From that he decided to just use Palance instead.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHcjVgDGffo2 Nov 27, 1955 episode "What's My Line?"]</ref>

==Career==
Palance's acting break came as [[Marlon Brando]]'s [[understudy]] in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]],'' and he eventually replaced Brando on stage as [[Stanley Kowalski]].

In 1947, Palance made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut.  He debuted on television in 1949, and this was followed a year later by his screen debut in the movie ''[[Panic in the Streets (film)|Panic in the Streets]]'' (1950).<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001588/</ref> The very same year he was featured in ''[[Halls of Montezuma (film)|Halls of Montezuma]]'' about the U.S. Marines in World War II, where he was credited as "Walter (Jack) Palance." Palance was quickly recognized for his skill as a character actor, receiving an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for only his third film role, as Lester Blaine in ''[[Sudden Fear]].''

The following year, Palance was again nominated for an Oscar, this time for his role as the hired gunfighter Jack Wilson in ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]].'' Several other Western roles followed, but he also played such varied roles as [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], [[Dracula]] and [[Attila the Hun]]. Three years before Palance played the part, [[comic book]] artist [[Gene Colan]] based his interpretation of Dracula for the acclaimed series ''[[The Tomb of Dracula]]'' on Palance, explaining, "He had that cadaverous look, a serpentine look on his face. I knew that Jack Palance would do the perfect Dracula."<ref>{{cite book |last=Field |first=Tom |authorlink= |title=Secrets in the Shadows: The Art & Life of Gene Colan |url= |year=2005 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |isbn= |page= 99}}</ref>

In 1957, Palance won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for best actor for his portrayal of Mountain McClintock in the ''[[Playhouse 90]]'' production of [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Requiem for a Heavyweight]].''

[[Jean-Luc Godard]] persuaded Palance to take on the role of Hollywood producer Jeremy Prokosch in the 1963 [[nouvelle vague]] movie ''[[Contempt (film)|Le Mépris]]'' with [[Brigitte Bardot]] and [[Michel Piccoli]]. Although the main dialogue was in [[French language|French]], Palance spoke mostly English.

Later, in 1966, he appeared in the movie ''[[Alice Through the Looking Glass (1966 film)|Alice Through the Looking Glass]]'' directed by [[Alan Handley]] in which he played the [[Jabberwocky|''Jabberwock'']].

In 1969, Palance recorded a country music album in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], released on [[Warner Bros. Records]]. It featured Palance's self-penned song "The Meanest Guy That Ever Lived". The album was re-released on CD in 2003 by the Water label (Water 119).

Palance starred in the television series ''[[Bronk (TV series)|Bronk]]'' between 1975 and 1976 for [[MGM Television]].

In 1982, Palance began hosting a television revival of ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not! (TV series)|Ripley's Believe It or Not!]].''  The weekly series ran from 1982 to 1986 on the American [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. The series also starred three different co-hosts from season to season, including Palance's daughter [[Holly Palance]], actress [[Catherine Shirriff]] and singer [[Marie Osmond]]. ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' was in rerun  syndication on the [[Sci-fi Channel]] (UK) and Sci-fi Channel (US) during the 1990s.

[[File:Jack Palance 1974.jpg|thumb|in ''The Godchild'' (1974)]]
Palance's success on ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!'' resulted in a demand for his services.  He made memorable appearances in ''[[Young Guns (film)|Young Guns]]'' (1988), ''[[Tango & Cash]]'' (1989) and [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), all of which served to reinvigorate his movie career. Palance would be involved in new projects each year right up to the start of the 21st century. He also performed on [[Roger Waters]]' first solo album release ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'' in 1984.

Palance, at the time chairman of the [[Hollywood Trident Foundation]], walked out of a Russian Film Festival in Hollywood in 2004. After being introduced, Palance said, "I feel like I walked into the wrong room by mistake. I think that Russian film is interesting, but I have nothing to do with Russia or Russian film. My parents were born in Ukraine: I'm Ukrainian. I'm not Russian. So, excuse me, but I don't belong here. It's best if we leave."<ref>[http://www.ukemonde.com/palance/russianfilmfest.html Declaring 'I'm Ukrainian, not Russian', Palance walks out of the Russian Film Festival in Hollywood<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Palance was awarded the title of "People's Artist" by the President [[Vladimir Putin]] on that occasion; however, Palance refused the title.<ref>http://www.ukemonde.com/palance/russianfilmfest.html</ref>

In 2001, Palance returned to the recording studio as a special guest on friend [[Laurie Z]]'s ''Heart of the Holidays'' album to narrate the famous classic poem "[[A Visit from St. Nicholas|The Night Before Christmas]]."

In 2002, he starred in the television movie ''Living with the Dead'' opposite [[Ted Danson]], [[Mary Steenburgen]] and [[Diane Ladd]]. In 2004, he starred in another television production, ''[[Back When We Were Grownups]]'' opposite [[Blythe Danner]]; Palance played Poppy.  This would be his final performance.

According to writer [[Mark Evanier]], comic book creator [[Jack Kirby]] modeled his character [[Darkseid]] on the actor.<ref>[http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_11_10.html#012391 news from me - ARCHIVES<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Legendary advertising copywriter [[Eric Molina]] repeatedly states<ref>[https://twitter.com/ericvmolina/status/517402814893408256]</ref> the Palance's Skin Bracer commercial<ref>{{YouTube|bZ5spLy22mg}}</ref> is the reason he entered the profession.

===Academy Award===
Four decades after his film debut, Palance won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] on March 30, 1992, for his performance as cowboy Curly Washburn in the [[1991 in film|1991]] comedy ''[[City Slickers]]''. Stepping onstage to accept the award, the intimidatingly fit 6' 4" (1.93 m) actor looked down at 5' 7" (1.70 m) Oscar host [[Billy Crystal]] (who was also his co-star in the movie), and joked – mimicking one of his lines from the film – "Billy Crystal... I crap bigger than him." He then dropped to the floor and demonstrated his ability, at age 73, to perform one-handed [[push ups|push-ups]].

Crystal turned this into a running gag. At first, he quipped, "I told Jack before the ceremony, 'Decaf, Jack, decaf'" then at various points in the broadcast he announced that Palance had done the following:

* was backstage on the [[Stairmaster]];
* "...just [[bungee jumping|bungee-jumped]] off the [[Hollywood sign]]";
* rendezvoused with the [[Space Shuttle]] in orbit;
* fathered all the children in a production number;
* been named [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]]'s [[Sexiest Man Alive]];
* had won the [[New York]] [[primary election]].

At the end of the broadcast, Crystal told everyone he would like to see them again, "But, I've just been informed Jack Palance will be hosting next year."

Years later, Billy Crystal appeared on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' with [[James Lipton]] and fondly recalled that after the Oscar ceremony Palance approached him during the reception, "He stopped me and put his arms out and went, 'Billy Crystal, who thought it would be you?.'  It was his really funny way of saying thank you to a little New York Jewy guy who got him the Oscars".<ref>{{YouTube|F6OqjqTIujg}}</ref>

In 1993, during the opening of the Oscars, a spoof of that Oscar highlight featured Palance appearing to drag in an enormous Academy Award statuette with Crystal again hosting, riding on the rear end of it. Half way across the stage, Palance dropped to the ground as if exhausted, but then performed several one-armed push-ups before regaining his feet and dragging the giant Oscar the rest of the way across the stage.

==Death and legacy==
On November 10, 2006, Palance died of [[natural causes]] at age 87 at his daughter Holly's home in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]] in [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]].<ref name=death>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/11/10/palance.death/index.html Oscar winner Jack Palance dead at 87], [[CNN|CNN.com]]. Retrieved on November 10, 2006.</ref> His remains were cremated, his ashes retained by family and friends.<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=16588921 FindAGrave.com]</ref> Jack Palance lived for a number of years around [[Tehachapi, California|Tehachapi]], near [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], in southern California.

Palance has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6608 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1992, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].

==Personal life==
[[File:Palance, Jack (VA).jpg|right|thumb|Jack Palance (left) visiting a [[Veterans Health Administration|VA Hospital]] in 2005]]
Palance was married to his first wife, Virginia Baker, from 1949 to 1968, they had three children: [[Holly Palance|Holly]] (born in 1950), an actress, Brooke (born in 1952) and Cody (1955–1998). On New Year's Day 2003, Palance's first wife Virginia Baker, (July 7, 1922 – January 1, 2003) was struck and killed by a car in Los Angeles.

His daughter Brooke married Michael Wilding, son of [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]] Sr. (1912–1979) and [[Elizabeth Taylor]]; they have three children.

Cody Palance, an actor himself, appeared alongside his father in the film ''[[Young Guns (film)|Young Guns]].''  Cody would die from [[malignant melanoma]] at age 42 on July 16, 1998. Palance had hosted ''The Cody Palance Memorial Golf Classic'' to raise awareness and funds for a cancer center in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].  Aside from acting Cody was also a musician.<ref>[http://www.hankstermania.com/Cody.htm Pics of Cody Palance performing live]</ref>

In May 1987, Palance married his second wife, Elaine Rogers. Palance painted and sold landscape art, with a poem included on the back of each picture.  He was also the author of ''The Forest of Love,'' a book of poems published in 1996 by Summerhouse Press.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=-dcLAAAACAAJ&dq=jack+palance&source=bl&ots=XGn-mkUlts&sig=NTJK90xb8hHXetSnZepSlkT8ft4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pYw5UIPWK4O89gTf2oAo&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ |title=The Forest of Love |publisher= Summerhouse Press |date=1996-01-01 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>

Palance acknowledged a lifelong attachment to his Pennsylvania heritage and visited there when able. Shortly before his death he placed his [[Butler Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Butler Township, Pennsylvania]], Holly-Brooke farm up for sale and his personal art collection up for auction.<ref name="Learn-Andes">{{cite web|url=http://www.timesleader.com/mld/timesleader/15708541.htm|title=Jump on Jack’s stash|last=Learn-Andes|first=Jennifer|publisher=TimesLeader.com|accessdate=2006-10-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061019090024/http://www.timesleader.com/mld/timesleader/15708541.htm<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-19}}</ref>
