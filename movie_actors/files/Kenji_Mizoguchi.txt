'''Kenji Mizoguchi''' (溝口 健二 ''Mizoguchi Kenji''; May 16, 1898 &ndash; August 24, 1956) was a Japanese [[film director]] and [[screenwriter]]. His film ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953) won the Silver Lion at the [[Venice Film Festival]], and appeared in the ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' Critics' Top Ten Poll in 1962 and 1972. Mizoguchi is renowned for his mastery of the [[long take]] and [[Mise en scène|mise-en-scène]].<ref>{{cite news|title= A Closer Look at a Japanese Master |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=6 January 1997|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-06/entertainment/ca-15763_1_kenji-mizoguchi|accessdate=2010-11-23|first=Kevin|last=Thomas}}</ref> According to writer Mark Le Fanu, "His films have an extraordinary force and purity.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Mizoguchi was born in [[Hongo]], [[Tokyo]],<ref name="Le Fanu 22">{{harvnb|Le Fanu|2005|p=22}}</ref> one of three children. His father was a roofing carpenter. The family was modestly [[middle-class]] until his father tried to make a living selling raincoats to soldiers during the [[Russo-Japanese war]]. The war ended too quickly for the investment to succeed; his family circumstances turned abject and they had to give his older sister up "for adoption" and moved from [[Hongo]] to [[Asakusa]], near the theatre and [[brothel]] quarter.<ref name="Le Fanu 22"/> In effect his sister Suzuko, or Suzu, was sold into [[geisha]]dom - an event which profoundly affected Mizoguchi's outlook on life. Between this and his father's brutal treatment of his mother and sister, he maintained a fierce resistance against his father throughout his life.

In 1911, Mizoguchi's parents, too poor to continue paying for their son's primary school training, sent him to stay with an uncle in [[Morioka]], in northern Japan, for a year - a period that saw the onset of crippling [[rheumatoid arthritis]] that was to afflict him during adolescence and leave him with a lop-sided walking gait for the rest of his life.<ref name="Le Fanu 23">{{harvnb|Le Fanu|2005|p=23}}</ref> The year 1912, back with his parents, was spent almost entirely in bed. In 1913 Mizoguchi's sister Suzu secured him work as an apprentice, designing patterns for [[kimono]]s and [[yukata]]s. In 1915 his mother died, and Suzu brought her younger brothers into her own house and looked after them. In 1916 he enrolled for a course at the Aoibashi Yoga Kenkyuko art school in [[Tokyo]], which taught Western painting techniques. At this time too he pursued a new interest in [[opera]], particularly at the Royal Theatre at [[Akasaka, Tokyo|Akasaka]] where he began, in due course, to help the set decorators.

In 1917 his sister again helped him to find work, this time a post with the ''Yuishin Nippon'' newspaper in [[Kobe]], as an advertisement designer.  The writer [[Tadao Sato]] has pointed out a coincidence between Mizoguchi's life in his early years and the plots of [[shimpa]] dramas. Such works characteristically documented the sacrifices made by geishas on behalf of the young men they were involved with. Though Suzu was his sister and not a lover, "the subject of women's suffering is fundamental in all his work; while the sacrifice a sister makes for a brother - makes a key showing in a number of his films - ''[[Sansho Dayu]]'' for example." <ref name="Le Fanu 23"/> After less than a year in Kobe however he returned, "to the bohemian delights of Tokyo." <ref name="Le Fanu 23"/> Mizoguchi entered the Tokyo film industry as an [[actor]] in 1920; three years later he would become a full-fledged director, at the [[Nikkatsu Corporation|Nikkatsu]] studio, directing ''Ai-ni yomigaeru hi'' (''The Resurrection of Love''), his first movie, during a workers' [[Strike action|strike]].

===Film career===
Mizoguchi's early works had been exploratory, mainly genre works, remakes of [[German Expressionism]] and adaptions of [[Eugene O'Neill]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In these early years Mizoguchi worked quickly, sometimes churning out a film in weeks. These would account for over fifty films from the 1920s and 1930s, the majority of which are now lost.

[[Image:Kenji Mizoguchi - in Europe, 1953.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Kenji Mizoguchi travelling through Europe, 1953]]
After the [[Great Kantō earthquake]] on September 1, 1923, Mizoguchi moved to Nikkatsu’s [[Kyoto]] studios and was working there until a scandal caused him to be temporarily suspended: Yuriko Ichijo, a call girl whom he was co-habiting with, attacked and wounded Mizoguchi's back with a razor-blade. "Working in Kyoto -the home of the traditional arts-had a decisive influence. Mizoguchi studied ''[[kabuki]]'', ''[[noh]]'', and traditional Japanese dance and music."<ref name="sato">{{harvnb|Sato|2008| p=10}}</ref>

Several of Mizoguchi's later films were ''keikō-eiga'' or "[[tendency film]]s," in which Mizoguchi first explored his [[socialist]] tendencies and moulded his famous signature preoccupations. Later in his life Mizoguchi maintained that his career as a serious director did not begin until ''[[Sisters of the Gion]]'' and ''[[Osaka Elegy]]'' (both 1936).

In his middle films, Mizoguchi began to be hailed as a director of 'new realism': social documents of a Japan that was making its transition from [[feudalism]] into modernity. ''[[The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums]]'' (1939) won a prize with the Education Department; like the two above mentioned films, it explores the deprecatory role of women in an unfairly male-centered society. During this time, Mizoguchi also developed his signature "one-scene-one-shot" approach to cinema. The meticulousness and authenticity of his [[set designer]] [[Hiroshi Mizutani]] would contribute to Mizoguchi's frequent use of [[wide-angle lens]]es.

During the war, Mizoguchi was forced to make compromises for the military government as [[propaganda]]; the most famous is a retelling of the [[Samurai]] [[bushido]] classic ''[[The 47 Ronin (1941 film)|The 47 Ronin]]'' (1941), an epic ''[[jidaigeki|jidai geki]]'' ("historical drama").

Significant directors who have admired his work include [[Akira Kurosawa]],<ref name="Richie1999">{{cite book|author=Donald Richie|title=The Films of Akira Kurosawa, Third Edition, Expanded and Updated|accessdate=18 September 2012|date=20 January 1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22037-9|page=97|quote=“His greatness was that he never gave up trying to heighten the reality of each scene. He never made compromises. He never said that something or other ‘would do.’ Instead, he pulled—or pushed—everyone along with him until they had created the feeling which matched his own inner image. An ordinary director is quite incapable of this. And in this lay his true spirit as a director—for he had the temperament of a true creator. He pushed and bullied and he was often criticized for this but he held out, and he created masterpieces. This attitude toward creation is not at all easy, but a director like him is especially necessary in Japan where this kind of pushing is so resisted. […] In the death of Mizoguchi, Japanese film lost its truest creator.”}}</ref> [[Orson Welles]],<ref>{{harvnb|Welles|1998|p=146}}</ref> [[Masahiro Shinoda]] and  [[Kaneto Shindo]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]],<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/03/movies/03raff.html Kenji Mizoguchi’s Movies Seek Beauty -- New York Times]</ref> [[Andrei Tarkovsky]],<ref>[http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Tarkovsky-TopTen.html Tarkovsky's Choice]</ref> [[Jean-Marie Straub]], [[Victor Erice]], [[Jacques Rivette]] and [[Theo Angelopoulos]] <ref>Mizoguchi The Master, Gerald O'Grady,ed.</ref>

===Post-war recognition===
[[Image:Yoshikata Yoda, Kinuyo Tanaka, Kenji Mizoguchi - in Paris, 1953.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Screenwriter Yoshikata Yoda, Actress Kinuyo Tanaka, and Kenji Mizoguchi visit Paris, 1953]]
Although regarded, like his contemporary [[Yasujirō Ozu]], as outdated and old-fashioned by Japanese audience immediately after the war, Mizoguchi was rediscovered, particularly by ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' critics like [[Jacques Rivette]], in the West. After a phase inspired by Japanese women's [[suffrage]], which produced radical films like ''Victory of the Women'' (1946) and ''My Love Has Been Burning'' (1949), Mizoguchi took a turn to the ''[[jidai-geki]]'' — or period drama, re-made from stories from Japanese [[folklore]] or period history — together with long-time screenwriter and collaborator [[Yoshikata Yoda]]. It was to be his most celebrated series of works, including ''[[The Life of Oharu]]'' (1952), which won him international recognition and which he considered his best film, and ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953), which won the Silver Lion at the [[Venice Film Festival]]. ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' (1954) reworks a premise from feudal Japan (and the short story by [[Mori Ōgai]]). Of his nearly 100 films, only two &mdash; ''[[Shin Heike Monogatari (film)|Tales of the Taira Clan]]'' (1955) and ''[[Princess Yang Kwei-Fei]]'' (1955) &mdash; were made in colour.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Mizoguchi died in [[Kyoto]] of [[leukemia]] at the age of 58, by which time he had become recognized as one of the three masters of [[Japanese cinema]], together with [[Yasujirō Ozu]] and [[Akira Kurosawa]]. At the time of his death, Mizoguchi was working on a film called ''Osaka Story''. In all he made (according to his memory) about 75 films, although most of his early ones were lost.  In 1975, [[Kaneto Shindo]] filmed a documentary about Mizoguchi, ''[[Kenji Mizoguchi: The Life of a Film Director]]'', as well as writing a book published in 1976.<ref name="shindo-bio">{{kaneto-shindo-aru-eiga-kantoku}}</ref> A retrospective series of his 30 surviving films, sponsored by [[The Japan Foundation]] toured several American cities in 2014.
