Farrell next appeared in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''Cassandra's Dream'', which premiered in 2007 and was distributed in the US in early 2008. Reviews were mixed,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/item_CwTYTmsIuqlQi0xycpOODK;jsessionid=C20C8FF09B262714C1BC75B90FFD57C7|title= Lost in a Dark Woody|last=Smith|first=Kyle|work=New York Post|date=18 June 2008}}</ref> with Maitland McDonagh of ''TV Guide'' writing that Allen's work was "shallow and unconvincing from beginning to end"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/cassandras-dream/review/291844|title=Cassandra's Dream: Review}}</ref> and [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' saying that although "it's not as good as ''Match Point'' or ''Crimes and Misdemeanors''...taken on its own, it's a fairly impressive piece, a directorially vigorous, well-acted, tightly constructed movie". LaSalle praised Farrell: "Allen is notorious for not giving his actors explicit instructions, and yet somehow this worked wonders for Farrell, who has never seemed so naked, so clear and so unencumbered as he does here."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Review-Brothers-in-a-bloody-fine-bleedin-mess-3232239.php|title=Review: Brothers in a bloody fine bleedin' mess|date=18 January 2008 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> Manohla Dargis concurred in the ''New York Times'', adding that he thought Farrell was well-matched with co-star [[Ewan McGregor]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/movies/18cass.html?_r=0|title=Movie Review: Cassandra's Dream|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|work=The New York Times|date=18 January 2008}}</ref>

Farrell's next film, [[Martin McDonagh]]'s first full-length feature ''[[In Bruges (film)|In Bruges]]'', opened the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.

Shortly thereafter he appeared in ''[[Kicking It (film)|Kicking It]]'', a documentary following six homeless men from Kenya, Russia, Afghanistan, Ireland, Spain and the US as they attempt to qualify for the [[Homeless World Cup]]. Farrell appeared on screen and provided the narration,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homelessworldcup.org/news/colin-farrell-narrates-kicking-it|title=Colin Farrell Narrates on Kicking It|publisher=Homeless World Cup website|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref> donating his earnings to a homeless shelter in Ireland.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/10/sports/soccer/10soccer.html?ref=soccer&_r=0|title=A World Cup With the Goal of Helping Lives Off the Field|work=The New York Times | first=Jack|last=Bell|date=10 September 2008}}</ref> The film was released simultaneously in theatres and on television, airing on [[ESPN2]] in a very short window before its DVD release. Farrell received positive reviews for his involvement in the true story.

Later in 2008 Farrell was brother-in-law to [[Edward Norton]]'s character in [[Pride and Glory (film)|''Pride and Glory'']], a police drama directed by American Gavin O'Connor. Roger Ebert disliked the film<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081023/REVIEWS/810239991|title=Pride and Glory|date=23 October 2008 | work=Chicago Sun-Times|first=Chaz's|last=Blog}}</ref> and A.

===Recent work (2009–2014)===
On 11 January 2009, Farrell won the Golden Globe award for Best Actor: Musical or Comedy for ''In Bruges'', in which he co-starred with Brendan Gleeson. That year he also appeared in [[Terry Gilliam]]'s film ''[[The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]'', starring [[Christopher Plummer]] and soon-to-play-Spider-Man [[Andrew Garfield]]. Farrell was one of three actors (with [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Jude Law]]), who helped complete [[Heath Ledger]]'s role when Ledger died before filming ended. They played "Imaginarium" versions of Ledger's character Tony,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/12/17/terry.gilliam.interview/index.html|title=The making of 'The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'|publisher=CNN | date=18 December 2009}}</ref> donating their earnings to Ledger's daughter Matilda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7570056.stm |title=Trio give fees to Ledger's child |work=BBC News | date=19 August 2008}}</ref>

Farrell also starred that year in ''[[Triage (film)|Triage]]'', directed by Oscar-winning Bosnian screenwriter and director [[Danis Tanović]], about the life of a war correspondent. He lost 30 pounds for the role.<ref name=VTodd>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941308/ |title=Triage |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |date=4 October 2009 |work=Variety}}</ref> The actor's work was described as "dedicated" by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s [[Todd McCarthy]],<ref name="VTodd" /> and Julian Sancton of [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']] wrote that the film was "a hell of a lot more insightful than other movies that deal with a similar topic".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/09/triage-review-should-i-quit-my-job-to-become-a-war-reporter |title=Triage Review: Should I Quit My Job to Become a War Reporter?}}</ref> However, ''Triage'' was not widely distributed due to the marketing challenges posed by its difficult topics (including [[PTSD]]).<ref name="VTodd" /> That year, Farrell played a supporting role (as Tommy Sweet) in ''[[Crazy Heart]]'' with [[Jeff Bridges]].

Another 2009 release was [[Ondine (film)|''Ondine'']], a fantasy-drama directed by [[Neil Jordan]] starring Farrell as a fisherman with a handicapped daughter. Shot in the village of [[Castletownbere]] on Ireland's southwest coast, it featured cinematography by longtime [[Wong Kar-wai]] collaborator [[Christopher Doyle]].<ref name=Todd>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117941098?refcatid=31 |title=Movie review: Ondine |first=Todd |last=McCarthy |work=Variety |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> Mary Pols of ''Time'' magazine called the role "tailor-made for Farrell", saying that the actor gave a "beautifully confident performance".<ref name=Time>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1994056,00.html |title=Ondine: A Fish-Out-of-Water Fairytale |first=Mary |last=Pols |work=Time |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> Todd McCarthy of ''Variety'' singled Farrell out, noting that he worked well as an ensemble actor "graciously allowing [child star Alison Barry] to steal every scene she's in".<ref name=Todd/>

The next year, Farrell starred with [[Keira Knightley]] in the [[Crime fiction|crime]] [[Romance film|romance]] ''[[London Boulevard]]''. The film, American [[William Monahan]]'s debut as director after writing screenplays for ''[[The Departed]]'' and ''[[Body of Lies (film)|Body of Lies]]'', was panned by critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=136066|title=Reviews: London Boulevard |first=Kim |last=Newman |work=Empire |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> Peter Bradshaw of the ''Guardian'' wrote that the film "uses up all its energy, wit and ideas in the first 20 or so minutes, before collapsing into a flurry of boring violence".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/nov/25/london-boulevard-review |title=Reviews: London Boulevard |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=25 November 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> Leslie Felperin of ''Variety'' described it as "like a fancy, retro-styled pocket watch that someone accidentally broke and tried to reassemble with only a vague idea of clockwork".<ref name=fancy>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117944118?refcatid=31 |title=Film reviews: London Boulevard |first=Leslie |last=Felperin |work=Variety |date=25 September 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref> Felperin thought the stars' work was frail, with Farrell "mostly taciturn and vacuous."<ref name=fancy/>

The actor starred in the 2011 comedy ''[[Horrible Bosses]]'', directed by [[Seth Gordon]], with [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Jason Bateman]], [[Charlie Day]], and [[Jason Sudeikis]]. The film focuses on a trio of employees who plot to murder their tyrannical superiors.<ref>[http://www.popwatch.ew.com/2010/05/13/jamie-foxx-horrible-bosses-starz-michael-jackson-this-is-it/ "Jamie Foxx joins 'Horrible Bosses,' Starz to air 'Michael Jackson's 'This Is It'" by Kate Ward, EW]</ref> The ''London Observer''{{'}}s Mark Kermode wrote that although the film would have benefited from a tighter script, Farrell and Jamie Foxx had juicy roles which they "riff with panache".<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Kermode |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/nov/20/cars-2-horrible-bosses-dvd |title=Mark Kermode's DVD round-up: Cars 2; Horrible Bosses; Zookeeper; The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) |work=The Guardian |accessdate=3 January 2013 |location=London |date=20 November 2011}}</ref> Michael Phillips of the ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote that Farrell brought "massive, slobby relish" to his role as Sudeikis's cocaine-fiend boss.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jul/08/entertainment/la-et-horrible-bosses-20110708-66 |title= Movie review: 'Horrible Bosses |date=8 July 2011 | work=Los Angeles Times |first=Michael |last=Phillips}}</ref>

The film was released by [[DreamWorks]], with [[Craig Gillespie]] (of ''[[Lars and the Real Girl]]'') directing a script by ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' writer [[Marti Noxon]]. Sukhdev Sandhu of the ''[[London Telegraph|Telegraph]]'' wrote that Farrell "proves his comedy credentials once more....utterly seductive as the plushly eyebrowed carpenter-cum-bloodsucker",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/8735574/Fright-Night-review.html |title=Fright Night, review |first=Sukhdev |last=Sandhu |work=The Telegraph |date=1 September 2011 |accessdate=23 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref> while the ''New York Times''{{'}}s A.O.

Farrell starred with [[Kate Beckinsale]] in [[Columbia Pictures]]' ''[[Total Recall (2012 film)|Total Recall]]'', a 2012 remake of the [[Total Recall (1990 film)|1990 film]] with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Filmed from May to September 2011 in Toronto and directed by [[Len Wiseman]], the film was a new sci-fi take about a sleeper agent.<ref>{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Collura |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/113/1134298p1.html |title="Colin Farrell's Total Recall: Actor in negotiations to remake Arnie classic", November 15, 2010, IGN Movies |publisher=Movies.ign.com |date=15 November 2010 |accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref> Costar [[Jessica Biel]] appreciated Farrell's skills, calling the actor "surprising and exciting.

After premiering at the [[Toronto Film Festival]], ''[[Seven Psychopaths]]'' (Farrell's second film with [[Martin McDonagh|McDonagh]]) was released in October 2012. The actor starred as creatively blocked writer Marty in a [[black comedy]] with [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Woody Harrelson]] and [[Christopher Walken]]. It broke even at the box office<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=sevenpsychopaths.htm |title=Seven Psychopaths (2012) |publisher=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> and reviews were generally good, with David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' writing that Farrell "serves as an excellent foil for Rockwell" and the actor "is in subdued mode...his performance largely defined by the endless expressivity of his eyebrows".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/seven-psychopaths/review/369669 |title=Seven Psychopaths: Toronto Review |last=Rooney |first=David |date=11 September 2012 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> That month, Farrell appeared on the cover of the magazine ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]''.<ref name=Details>{{cite web |url=http://www.details.com/celebrities-entertainment/cover-stars/201211/colin-farrell-seven-psychopaths| title=The Blood, Sweat, and Tears of Colin Farrell |publisher=Details}}</ref>

March 2013 saw the release of ''Dead Man Down,'' a [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] directed by [[Niels Arden Oplev]] reuniting Farrell with [[Terrence Howard]] for the first time since ''Hart's War'' ten years earlier.

In 2014, Farrell starred in a film adaptation of [[Mark Helprin]]'s ''[[Winter's Tale (film)|Winter's Tale]]''. The film was written and directed by [[Akiva Goldsman]] and based on Helprin's [[Winter's Tale (novel)|1983 novel]], and co-starred [[Jessica Brown Findlay]], [[Russell Crowe]], and [[Will Smith]].

On 20 July 2006, as Farrell was being interviewed by [[Jay Leno]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|The Tonight Show]]'', telephone sex worker Dessarae Bradford evaded security, walked on stage, confronted Farrell and threw her book on Leno's desk. Farrell escorted her off the stage as she shouted "I'll see you in court", handing her over to [[NBC]] security. After being held by the [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] police, Bradford was released. The next day, Farrell obtained a [[restraining order]] against her<ref name="restraining">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/21/entertainment/main1824358.shtml|title=Colin Farrell Gets Restraining Order|last=Bonawitz|first=Amy |date=21 July 2006|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=10 April 2009}}</ref> and the incident was edited out of the broadcast.<ref name="ach" />
