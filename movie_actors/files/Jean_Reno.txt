==Early life==
Reno was born Juan Moreno y Herrera-Jiménez<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film.it/cinema/schedapersonaggio.php?id=31338 |title=Jean Reno - scheda attore |publisher=Film.it |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eupedia.com/france/famous_immigrant_french_people.shtml |title=France Guide - Famous French people of recent foreign descent |publisher=Eupedia |date=1994-04-19 |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> in [[Casablanca, Morocco|Casablanca]], [[Morocco]]. His parents were Spanish, natives of [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] and [[Jerez de la Frontera]] in [[Andalucia]], and had moved to North Africa to find work and escape the [[dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]]. He has a younger sister named María Teresa (''"Maite"''), and the children were raised Catholic.<ref name="allbusiness"/> Their father was a [[Linotype machine|linotypist]].<ref name=dla>{{cite news|last=Jamieson|first=Teddy|title=Jean Reno on 22 Bullets|publisher=Herald Scotland|date=2010-08-30|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/film-tv-features/jean-reno-on-22-bullets-1.1051548|accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref> Their mother died when Juan was a teenager.<ref name="allbusiness">{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/amusement-recreation-services/4728002-1.html |title=Jean Reno cracks the `Code', Business solutions from |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=2006-05-10 |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> He learned Spanish from his parents, and Arabic and French growing up in Morocco.

At the age of seventeen, Juan Moreno moved to France, where he studied acting in the [[René Simon|Cours Simon]] School of Drama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800022061/bio |title=Jean Reno Biography - Yahoo! Movies |publisher=Movies.yahoo.com |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

When Moreno moved to France he served in the [[French Army]] which was mandatory to gain his French citizenship.

==Career==
After he started to get acting jobs in France, Juan adopted the French version, ''Jean,'' of his name, and shortened his surname to Reno. Due to his large frame ({{convert|1.91|m|ftin|disp=x|; |abbr=on}}), Reno was called on to play "heavies" in his early career. He later appeared in romantic-comedies and action films. He began his film career in France, appearing in many films by director [[Luc Besson]], including his early ''[[Le dernier combat]]'' (1985). The two have continued to work together, collaborating in films produced, [[screenwriter|written]] or directed by Besson. Of their joint work,  those that have achieved the most [[criticism|critical]] and commercial success include: ''[[Nikita (film)|Nikita]]'' (1990), and the [[English language|English-language]] films ''[[The Big Blue]]'' (1988) and ''[[Léon: The Professional]]'' (1994). Reno did the voice-over for [[Mufasa]] in the French-language version of ''[[The Lion King]]'', a role originally performed in English by [[James Earl Jones]] in the American film.

Reno has starred in such high-profile American films as ''[[French Kiss (1995 film)|French Kiss]]'' (1995) with [[Meg Ryan]] and [[Kevin Kline]], ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' (1996) with [[Tom Cruise]], ''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'' (1998) with [[Robert De Niro]], and ''[[Godzilla]]'' (1998). Reno turned down the role of [[Agent Smith]] in ''[[The Matrix]]''. He also acted in French productions —e.g., ''[[Les Visiteurs]]'' (1993) (which was remade in English as ''[[Just Visiting (film)|Just Visiting]]'' in 2001); ''[[The Crimson Rivers]]'' (2000), and ''Jet Lag'' (''Décalage horaire'') by Danièle Thompson (2002), which was also a box-office success in [[France]]. 

In 2006, Reno had a prominent role in the remake of ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' and [[The Pink Panther 2|its sequel]], playing Gilbert Ponton, opposite [[Steve Martin]] as [[Inspector Clouseau]]. He portrayed [[Police captain|Captain]] [[Bezu Fache]] in the [[Ron Howard]] film ''[[The Da&nbsp;Vinci Code]]''. Among his most successful films are ''Les Visiteurs'' and ''L'Enquète corse''.

In other media, Reno was involved in the production of the third installment in the popular [[Capcom]] series ''[[Onimusha]]'' (''[[Onimusha&nbsp;3: Demon Siege]]''), lending his likeness to the protagonist Jacques Blanc, as well as providing the voice for the character's French dialogue. In advertising work, Reno has appeared in American television commercials for [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] and portrayed [[Doraemon]] in a series of [[Toyota]] ads in Japan, as part of the "ReBorn" campaign.<ref>[http://animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-11-18/film-star-jean-reno-live-action-doraemon-ad-streamed "Film star Jean Reno's live-action Doraemon ad streamed"], Anime News Network, 18 November 2011</ref>

==Personal life==

Reno first married Geneviève, with whom he has a daughter, Sandra (born 1978), and a son, Mickael (born 1980). Reno's second wife was [[Nathalie Dyszkiewicz]], a [[Poles|Polish]] model, with whom he has a son, Tom (born 10 January 1996), and a daughter, Serena (born 28 June 1998). 

On 29 July 2006, Reno married for the third time, to another [[Poles|Polish]] model and actress, [[Zofia Borucka]], 43, at the city hall of [[Les Baux-de-Provence|Baux-de-Provence]] in southern France. Then-presidential candidate [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] served as his best man (Reno endorsed Sarkozy for the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 French presidential election]]).<ref>[http://www.adweek.com/aw/magazine/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003593198 ], ''Ad Week''{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linternaute.com/sortir/cinema/diaporama/07/les-stars-qui-soutiennent-des-candidats/12.shtml |title=Les acteurs qui soutiennent des candidats : Jean Reno - Nicolas Sarkozy |publisher=Linternaute.com |date=2007 |accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> Zofia and Reno welcomed their first son Cielo born in July 2009 in New York City.
