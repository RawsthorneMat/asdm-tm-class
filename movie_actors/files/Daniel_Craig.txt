Craig achieved international fame when chosen as the sixth actor to play the role of James Bond in the official film series, taking over from [[Pierce Brosnan]] in 2005.

''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' followed two years later. Craig's third Bond film, ''[[Skyfall]]'', premiered in 2012 and is now the highest-grossing film in the series, as well as the [[List of highest-grossing films|ninth highest-grossing film]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=IMDB Release Info|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/releaseinfo|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article637090.ece |title='Best Bond ever' vanquishes his greatest foe&nbsp;– the critics |date=15 November 2006 |work=[[The Times]] |location=UK |accessdate=15 November 2006 |last=Hoyle |first= Ben}}</ref> Craig's fourth Bond film, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', will premiere in 2015.

In 2005, Craig was contracted by [[Eon Productions]] to portray James Bond. He stated he "was aware of the challenges" of the Bond franchise which he considered "a big machine that makes a lot of money". He aimed at bringing more "emotional depth" to the character.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4335052.stm|title=Daniel Craig: Our Friend in MI6|publisher=BBC News Online|accessdate=27 December 2007|date=14 October 2005}}</ref> Born in 1968, Craig is the first actor to portray [[James Bond]] to have been born after the Bond series started, and after the death of [[Ian Fleming]], the novels' writer. Significant controversy followed the decision, as it was doubted if the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period internet campaigns expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.moono.com/news/news01533.html|title=Anti-Bond protests|publisher=Moono|accessdate=3 April 2007}}</ref>

Craig describes his portrayal of Bond as an [[anti-hero]]: "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or just a bad guy who works for the good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing by the end of the film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is."<ref>{{cite news|authorlink=Kevin Sessums|last=Sessums|first=Kevin |title=The Man Who Loves Being Bad|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|date=26 October 2008|url=http://www.parade.com/celebrity/2008/10/daniel-craig|accessdate=27 October 2008}}</ref> Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is [[Sean Connery]], but says, ''"I'd never copy somebody else.
