'''Guillermo del Toro Gómez''' ({{IPA-es|ɡiˈʝeɾmo ðel ˈtoɾo}}; born October 9, 1964) is a Mexican film director, screenwriter, producer, and novelist. In his filmmaking career, del Toro has alternated between Spanish-language [[dark fantasy]] pieces, such as the gothic horror film ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' (2001) and ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' (2006), and more mainstream American action movies, such as the vampire superhero action film ''[[Blade II]]'' (2002), the supernatural superhero film ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'' (2004), its sequel ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'' (2008), and the science fiction monster film ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' (2013).

In addition to his directing works, del Toro is a prolific producer, his producing works including acclaimed and/or successful films such as ''[[The Orphanage (film)|The Orphanage]]'' (2007), ''[[Julia's Eyes]]'' (2010), ''[[Biutiful]]'' (2010), ''[[Kung Fu Panda 2]]'' (2011), ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'' (2011), and ''[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]]'' (2013). He was originally chosen by [[Peter Jackson]] to direct [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' films]]; he left the project due to production problems but was still credited as co-writer for his numerous contributions to the script.

Del Toro's work is characterised by a strong connection to [[fairy tale]]s and [[horror fiction|horror]], with an effort to infuse visual or poetic beauty.<ref name="Twitch">{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2013/01/gorbers-epic-guillermo-del-toro-interview-part-2-on-producing-and-building-a-canon-of-work.html|title=Gorber's Epic Guillermo del Toro Interview, Part 2: On Producing and Building a Canon of Work|work=twitchfilm.com|last=Gorber|first=Jason|date=January 15, 2013|accessdate=January 17, 2013}}</ref> He has a lifelong fascination with [[monster]]s, which he considers symbols of great power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/ideas/24295|title=Monsters Are Living, Breathing Metaphors |author=Guillermo del Toro |publisher=Big Think|work=bigthink.com|date=September 22, 2010|accessdate=January 17, 2013}}</ref> Del Toro is known for his use of insectile and religious imagery, the themes of Catholicism and celebrating imperfection, underworld and clockwork motifs, [[practical special effects]], dominant amber lighting, and his frequent collaborations with actors [[Ron Perlman]] and [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lexpiccione.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Del_Toro_Catalog2.304224554.pdf|title=Dissection of Darkness|work=lexpiccione.com|accessdate=January 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/07/guillermo_del_toro_on_pacific_rim_monsters_hollywood_and_other_scary_things.html|title=Guillermo del Toro on ''Pacific Rim'', monsters, Hollywood and other horrors|last=Whitty|first=Stephen|work=nj.com|date=July 7, 2013|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}</ref>

==Early life==
[[File:Guillermo del Toro (Guadalajara).jpg|thumb|150px|Del Toro promoting his first feature film, ''[[Cronos (film)|Cronos]]'', which was released in 1993.]]
Del Toro was born in [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]]. He was raised in a strict [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] household.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment/Like-his-bluecollar-demon-hero.4395428.jp|title=Like his blue-collar demon hero Hellboy, Guillermo del Toro has a few issues with authority|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|work=|date=2008-08-16|quote = |accessdate=2010-09-17|first=Stephen|last=Applebaum|location=Edinburgh}}</ref> Del Toro studied at the Centro de Investigación y Estudios Cinematográficos, in Guadalajara.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800026601/bio |title=Guillermo del Toro Biography&nbsp;— Yahoo!

When del Toro was about eight years old, he began experimenting with his father's [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] camera, making short films with ''[[Planet of the Apes (franchise)|Planet of the Apes]]'' toys and other objects. One short focused on a "serial killer potato" with ambitions of world domination; it murdered del Toro's mother and brothers before stepping outside and being crushed by a car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2agklw/i_am_guillermo_del_toro_director_writer_producer/|title=I am Guillermo del Toro, director, writer, producer. AMA.|publisher=[[Reddit]]|date=July 11, 2014|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> Del Toro made approximately ten short films before his first feature, including one titled ''Matilde'', but only the last two, ''[[Doña Lupe]]'' and ''[[Geometria (film)|Geometria]]'', have been made available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/short-starts-guillermo-del-toros-geometria-has-fun-with-irony-and-math.php|title=Short Starts: Guillermo del Toro's ''Geometria'' Has Fun With Irony and Math|work=filmschoolrejects|last=Campbell|first=Christopher|date=July 7, 2013|accessdate=July 8, 2013}}</ref> He also wrote four and directed five episodes of the [[cult series]] ''[[La Hora Marcada]]'', along with other Mexican filmmakers such as [[Emmanuel Lubezki]] and [[Alfonso Cuarón]].

Del Toro studied special effects and make-up with [[special effect]]s artist [[Dick Smith (make-up artist)|Dick Smith]].<ref>Wood, Jason, ''Talking Movies: Contemporary World Filmmakers in Interview'' Page 29</ref> He spent ten years as a special effects make-up designer and formed his own company, Necropia. He also co-founded the [[Guadalajara International Film Festival]]. Later on in his directing career, he formed his own production company, the Tequila Gang.

In 1997, at the age of 33, Guillermo was given a $30 million budget from [[Miramax Films]] to shoot another film, ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]''. During this time, his father, automotive entrepreneur Federico del Toro, was kidnapped in [[Guadalajara]]. Although Federico was eventually released safely, there was intense economic pressure from his captors, to the point that del Toro's family had to pay twice the amount originally asked. The event prompted del Toro, his parents and his siblings to move abroad. In an interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, he said this about the kidnapping of his father: "Every day, every week, something happens that reminds me that I am in involuntary exile [from my country]."<ref name="elmanana.com.mx">[http://www.elmanana.com.mx/notas.asp?id=67190 "We are a family of circus performers", ''El Mañana'', 13 July 2008] (in Spanish)</ref><ref name="Time">{{Cite news |last=Cruz |first=Gilbert |title=10 Questions for Guillermo del Toro |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 5, 2011 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2090370,00.html |accessdate=July 30, 2013 }}</ref>

|quote=I cannot pontificate about it, but by the time I'm done, I will have done one movie, and it's all the movies I want.

People say, you know, "I like your Spanish movies more than I like your English-language movies because they are not as personal", and I go "Fuck, you're wrong!" ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'' is as personal to me as ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''. They're tonally different, and yes, of course you can like one more than the other – the other one may seem banal or whatever it is that you don't like. But it really is part of the same movie. You make one movie.

[[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]] did one movie, all his life.}}

Del Toro has directed a wide variety of films, from [[comic book]] adaptations (''[[Blade II]]'', ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'') to historical fantasy and [[horror film]]s, two of which are set in Spain in the context of the [[Spanish Civil War]] under the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule of [[Francisco Franco]]. These two films, ''[[The Devil's Backbone]]'' and ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'', are among his most critically acclaimed works. They share similar settings, protagonists and themes with the 1973 Spanish film ''[[The Spirit of the Beehive]]'', widely considered to be the finest Spanish film of the 1970s.<ref>Curran, Daniel, ed. ''Foreign Films,'' film review and analysis of ''The Spirit of the Beehive,'' page 161-2, 1989. Evanston, Illinois: Cinebooks. ISBN 0-933997-22-1.</ref>

Del Toro views the horror genre as inherently political, explaining, "Much like fairy tales, there are two facets of horror. One is pro-institution, which is the most reprehensible type of fairy tale: Don't wander into the woods, and always obey your parents. The other type of fairy tale is completely anarchic and antiestablishment."<ref name="Time"/>

He is close friends with two other prominent and critically praised Mexican filmmakers [[Alfonso Cuarón]] and [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/del-toro-cuaron-and-inarritu-partners-up-with-universal/ |title=Del Toro, Cuaron, and Inarritu partners up with Universal |author=Nix |work=Beyond Hollywood |date=2007-05-20 |accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref> The three often influence each other's directorial decisions, and have been interviewed together by [[Charlie Rose]]. Cuarón was one of the producers of ''Pan's Labyrinth'', while Iñárritu assisted in editing the film.

Del Toro has also contributed to the [[web series]] ''[[Trailers From Hell]]''.<ref>[http://www.trailersfromhell.com/gurus/57 Guillermo del Toro]. ''Trailers From Hell!''. Retrieved October 24, 2011.</ref>

In April 2008, del Toro was hired by [[Peter Jackson]] to direct the [[The Hobbit (film series)|live-action film adaptation]] of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]''. On May 30, 2010, del Toro left the project due to extended delays brought on by MGM's financial troubles. Although he did not direct the films, he is credited as co-writer in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]'', ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2010/05/30/36920-guillermo-del-toro-departs-the-hobbit/ |title=Guillermo del Toro departs The Hobbit |publisher=theonering.com|date=May 30, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref>

On June 2, 2009, del Toro's first novel, ''[[The Strain]]'', was released. It is the first part of an apocalyptic vampire trilogy co-authored by del Toro and [[Chuck Hogan]]. The second volume, ''[[The Fall (del Toro / Hogan novel)|The Fall]]'', was released on September 21, 2010. The final installment, ''[[The Night Eternal]]'', followed in October 2011. Del Toro cites writings of [[Antoine Augustin Calmet]], [[Montague Summers]] and Bernhardt J. Hurwood among his favourites in the non-literary form about vampires.<ref>''[https://archive.org/details/WHUT_20090703_130000_Charlie_Rose#start/3060/end/3120 Charlie Rose]'', 3 July 2009.

On December 9, 2010, del Toro launched [[Mirada Studios]] with his long-time cinematographer [[Guillermo Navarro]], director Mathew Cullen and executive producer Javier Jimenez. Mirada was formed in Los Angeles, California to be a collaborative space where they and other filmmakers can work with Mirada's artists to create and produce projects that span digital production and content for film, television, advertising, interactive and other media. Mirada launched as a sister company to production company [[Motion Theory (company)|Motion Theory]].<ref>Borys, Kit.

Del Toro directed ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'', a science fiction film based on a screenplay by del Toro and [[Travis Beacham]]. In the film, [[kaiju|giant monsters]] rise from the Pacific Ocean and attack major cities, leading humans to retaliate with gigantic [[mecha]] suits called ''Jaegers''. Del Toro commented, "This is my most un-modest film, this has everything. The scale is enormous and I'm just a big kid having fun."<ref>http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=19724</ref> The film was released on July 12, 2013 and grossed $411 million at the box office.

Del Toro directed "[[Night Zero (The Strain)|Night Zero]]", the pilot episode of ''[[The Strain (TV series)|The Strain]]'', a vampire horror television series based on the [[The Strain|novel trilogy of the same name]] by del Toro and [[Chuck Hogan]]. [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] has commissioned the pilot episode, which del Toro scripted with Hogan and was filmed in [[Toronto]] in September 2013.<ref name="Toronto">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/article/1316099--guillermo-del-toro-s-toronto|title=Guillermo del Toro's Toronto|last=Barnard|first=Linda|work=thestar.com|date=January 17, 2013|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1710026/guillermo-del-toro-emma-watson-beauty-beast.jhtml|title=Finding Emma Watson's Beastly Costar Tops Guillermo Del Toro's To-Do List|last=Sullivan|first=Kevin P.|work=mtv.com|date=July 3, 2013|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}</ref> FX ordered a thirteen-episode first season for the series on November 19, 2013, and announced that the series will premiere some time in July 2014.<ref name="series">{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/11/19/the-strain-fx-series-order/|title='The Strain' gets FX series order: More vamps!|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=November 19, 2013|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}</ref>

After ''The Strain''{{'}}s pilot episode, del Toro began directing ''[[Crimson Peak]]'', a gothic horror film he co-wrote with [[Matthew Robbins (screenwriter)|Matthew Robbins]] and Lucinda Cox. Del Toro described the film as "a very set-oriented, classical but at the same time modern take on the ghost story", citing ''[[The Omen]]'', ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' as influences. Del Toro stated, "I think people are getting used to horror subjects done as [[found footage (genre)|found footage]] or [[B movie|B-value budgets]]. I wanted this to feel like a throwback."

==Future projects==
Del Toro is scheduled to direct three films for Universal: ''[[Frankenstein]]''; a new adaptation of ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''; and ''[[Drood (novel)|Drood]]'', a film based on a [[Dan Simmons]] novel published in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=23174 |title=Del Toro Commits To Universal Until 2017 |publisher=Empireonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-14}}</ref> ''Drood'' was expected to be his first project after the two films set in Middle-earth.

Del Toro said his ''Frankenstein'' would be a faithful "[[John Milton|Miltonian]] tragedy", citing [[Frank Darabont]]'s "near perfect" script, which evolved into [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''[[Frankenstein (1994 film)|Frankenstein]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Mike Sampson | title = Guillermo talks! | work = [[JoBlo.com]] | date = 2007-10-26 | url = http://joblo.com/guillermo-talks | accessdate=2007-10-27}}</ref> Del Toro said of his vision, "What I'm trying to do is take the myth and do something with it, but combining elements of ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' without making it just a classical myth of the monster. The best moments in my mind of ''Frankenstein'', of the novel, are yet to be filmed [...] The only guy that has ever nailed for me the emptiness, not the tragic, not the Miltonian dimension of the monster, but the emptiness is [[Christopher Lee]] in the Hammer films, where he really looks like something obscenely alive. [[Boris Karloff]] has the tragedy element nailed down but there are so many versions, including that great screenplay by Frank Darabont that was ultimately not really filmed."<ref>{{cite news | author = Chris Hewitt | title = Guillermo Del Toro Talks The Hobbit | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = 2008-02-08 | url = http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/Interview.asp?IID=740&CurrentPage=2 | accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref> He has also cited [[Bernie Wrightson]]'s illustrations as inspiration, and said the film will not focus on the monster's creation, but be an adventure film featuring the character.<ref>{{cite news|author=Max Evry|title=Guillermo del Toro on The Hobbit and Frankenstein|work=ComingSoon.net|date=2008-10-05|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/hobbitnews.php?id=49378|accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> Del Toro said he would like Wrightson to design his version of the creature.

In 2008, del Toro announced a [[stop-motion]] film based on the Italian novel ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', co-directed by Adam Parrish King, with [[Jim Henson Company]] as production company, and music by [[Nick Cave]].<ref>http://www.slashfilm.com/guillermo-del-toros-next-film-to-be-horror-also-producing-stop-motion-pinocchio-and-horror-anthology-tv-series/</ref> It was in production for three years, and is now in [[development hell]]. The pre-production was begun by the studio ''[[ShadowMachine]]''.

In June 2010, news came that del Toro would be writing and producing a brand new take on the story of Van Helsing. There is no word yet on if he will direct or not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefilmstage.com/2010/06/10/guillermo-del-toro-writingproducing-new-van-helsing-film/|title=Guillermo Del Toro Writing And Producing New Van Helsing|work=[http://www.thefilmstage.com The Film Stage]|accessdate=June 10, 2010|date=June 10, 2010}}</ref>

At Comic-Con 2010, del Toro made the surprise announcement that he would co-write, produce, and likely direct a 3D ''[[Haunted Mansion]]'' film for [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]. Del Toro says the film will stray away from the comedic nature of the [[The Haunted Mansion (film)|2003 film]] and will revolve around the ride's [[Hatbox Ghost]].<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE66M0L120100723 "Guillermo del Toro enters Haunted Mansion", Reuters, 23 July 2010]</ref>

On July 28, 2010, it was announced that he would direct ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] for Universal Pictures, with [[James Cameron]] as producer. The movie was originally set up as a project at DreamWorks in 2004.<ref>[http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/cameron-produce-del-toros-madness-universal-19671 Cameron to Produce Del Toro's 'Madness' for Universal]</ref> Just a month earlier, del Toro said that the Lovecraft adaptation probably wouldn't happen at all; "It doesn't look like I can do it. It's very difficult for the studios to take the step of doing a period-set, R-rated, tentpole movie with a tough ending and no love story. Lovecraft has a readership as big as any best-seller, but it's tough to quantify because his works are in the public domain." Not long after, he was approached by Cameron who asked him if he still wanted to do the movie.

==Personal life==
[[Image:Guillermo del Toro by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Guillermo del Toro in 2013]]
He is married to Lorenza Newton, cousin of Mexican singer [[Guadalupe Pineda]]. He started dating Lorenza when both were studying at the Guadalajara School of Sciences. He currently lives in [[Agoura Hills]], [[California]] with his wife and two daughters.<ref name="elmanana.com.mx"/> In addition to the home in which he lives with his family, he owns a separate house exclusively to house his books, poster artwork and other belongings pertaining to his work, explaining, "As a kid, I dreamed of having a house with secret passages and a room where it rained 24 hours a day. The point of being over 40 is to fulfill the desires you've been harboring since you were 7."<ref name="Time"/>

In a 2007 interview, del Toro described his political position as "a little too [[liberalism|liberal]]." He pointed out that the villains in most of his films, such as the [[business magnate|industrialist]] in ''[[Cronos (film)|Cronos]]'', the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'', and the [[Francisco Franco|Francoists]] in ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'', are united by the common attribute of [[authoritarianism]]. "I hate structure. I'm completely anti-structural in terms of believing in institutions. I hate them. I hate any institutionalised social, religious, or economic holding."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LcKqCPI2ew|title=Guillermo del Toro: "I hate structure."|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=August 6, 2007|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref>

In 2009, in an interview with [[Charlie Rose]], del Toro described his [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] upbringing as excessively "morbid," saying, "I mercifully lapsed as a Catholic, I say, but as [[Luis Buñuel|Buñuel]] used to say, 'I'm an [[Atheism|atheist]], thank God.'" Though insisting that he is spiritually "not with Buñuel" and that "once a Catholic, always a Catholic, in a way," he followed by saying, "I believe in man. I believe in mankind, as the worst and the best that has happened to this world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10441 |title=A conversation with Guillermo del Toro |publisher=Charlie Rose |date=2009-07-02 |accessdate=2010-03-14}}</ref> He has also responded to the observation that he views his art as his religion by saying, "It is. To me, art and storytelling serve primal, spiritual functions in my daily life. Whether I'm telling a bedtime story to my kids or trying to mount a movie or write a short story or a novel, I take it very seriously."<ref name="Time"/>

In 2010, del Toro revealed that he was a fan of video games, describing them as "the comic books of our time" and "a medium that gains no respect among the intelligentsia." He has stated that the only games he considers masterpieces are ''[[Ico]]'' and ''[[Shadow of the Colossus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080831035622/http://www.edge-online.com/magazine/hellboy-director-talks-gaming|title=Hellboy Director Talks Gaming|author=Edge Staff|publisher=Edge Online|date=August 26, 2008|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref>

Del Toro's favorite film monsters are [[Frankenstein's monster]], the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]], [[Gill-man]], [[Godzilla]], and [[The Thing (1982 film)|the Thing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/50956|title=Guillermo Del Toro And Mr. Beaks Discuss DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK, PACIFIC RIM And The Far-From-Used-Up Future Of AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS!|author=Mr. Beaks|work=aintitcool.com|date=August 24, 2011|accessdate=September 29, 2012}}</ref> Frankenstein in particular has a special meaning for him, in both film and literature, as he claims he has a "Frankenstein fetish to a degree that is unhealthy," and that it's "the most important book of my life, so you know if I get to it, whenever I get to it, it will be the right way."<ref>[http://www.slashfilm.com/guillermo-del-toro-speaks-on-the-set-of-mama-the-state-of-horror-overextending-himself-battling-the-mpaa-frankenstein-and-much-more/ Guillermo Del Toro Speaks On The Set Of ‘Mama’ – The State of Horror, Overextending Himself, Battling the MPAA, Frankenstein And Much More]</ref>

In an interview with [[Robert K. Elder]] for his book The ''[[Best Film You've Never Seen]]'', del Toro explains his careful methodology: “I’m as thorough and as well-prepared as I can be in my filmmaking, and that came from the discipline of having to work as a make-up effects artist many, many, many times in my life.”<ref>Elder, Robert K.
