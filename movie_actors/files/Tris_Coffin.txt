Coffin was born in the [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[mining]] community of [[Mammoth, Utah|Mammoth]] in [[Juab County, Utah|Juab County]] in central [[Utah]] and was reared in the state capital of [[Salt Lake City]]. He began acting while he was in high school and thereafter joined traveling stock companies. He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[speech]] from the [[University of Washington]] at [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. He worked as a news analyst and [[sports commentator|sportscaster]] until spotted by a [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] talent scout.

In 1940, Coffin appeared as Phillips, along with [[Milburn Stone]], later of ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', and [[I. Stanford Jolley]], in ''[[Chasing Trouble]]'', a comedy espionage film. He is perhaps best known for his role as Jeff King in [[Republic Pictures]]' ''[[King of the Rocket Men]]'', the first of three serials starring the "Rocketman" character, who would later be paid homage to through the character of [[Rocketeer|The Rocketeer]], which was adapted into a [[Walt Disney]] film in 1992. During the 1940s and into the early 1950s Coffin appeared in many other movie serials, including ''Mysterious Dr. Satan'', ''[[Sky Raiders]]'', ''[[Holt of the Secret Service]]'', ''[[Perils of Nyoka]]'', ''Federal Agents vs. the Underworld'', ''[[Radar Patrol vs. Spy King]]'', and ''[[Captain Video: Master of the Stratosphere]]''.<ref>Tristram Coffin, IMDb (Internet Movie Database), [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0168939/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1] Retrieved October 31, 2013</ref>

He had guest starred in the series ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'', sometimes playing a "good guy", sometimes a "bad guy".

He also had a role in the very first TV episode of ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'', as Captain Reid of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], the older brother of the man who would become The Lone Ranger after his brother and four other comrades were murdered by outlaws. From 1951 to 1955, he appeared eight times as [[Colonel]] Culver in the [[Bill Williams (actor)|Bill Williams]] [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[television program|television series]], ''[[The Adventures of Kit Carson]]''.

In 1956, Coffin appeared in different roles in six episodes of the syndicated series, ''[[Judge Roy Bean (TV series)|Judge Roy Bean]]'', with [[Edgar Buchanan]], [[Jack Buetel]], and [[Jackie Loughery]]. He also appeared as a guest star in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] western series, ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', starring [[Hugh O'Brian]] in the title role.

Coffin played the lead as Captain [[Thomas H. Rynning]] in his own syndicated series ''[[26 Men]]'', based on official files of the [[Arizona Rangers]] in the final days of taming the "Old West" before Arizona statehood in 1912. [[Kelo Henderson]] appeared with Coffin in the role of Deputy Clint Travis.

In 1966, Coffin played [[Joshua Bean]], the older brother of [[Roy Bean]] (played by [[Tom Skerritt]]) in the episode "A Sense of Justice", of the syndicated western series ''[[Death Valley Days]]''. The segment is set in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]], where Joshua Bean was the founding mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556724/?ref_=tt_ep_nx|title="A Sense of Justice" on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|date=October 6, 1966|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}</ref> 

In 1954, Coffin committed a noted [[blooper]] on the ''[[Climax!]]'' [[live television]] anthology series, in "[[The Long Goodbye (novel)#Film & television adaptations|The Long Goodbye]]", in which Coffin's character was depicted as lying dead.
