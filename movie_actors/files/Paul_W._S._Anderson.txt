'''Paul William Scott Anderson''' (born 4 March 1965) is an English film director, producer, and screenwriter who regularly works in [[Science fiction film|science fiction movies]] and [[video game adaptations|video game]] movies. He is primarily best known for directing, producing, and writing the ''[[Resident Evil (film series)|Resident Evil]]'' films, which are based on the [[Resident Evil|video games of the same name]].

==Early life==
Anderson was born in [[Wallsend]] of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], England. Educated at Newlands Preparatory School, Gosforth and later at Newcastle's [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle|Royal Grammar School]], Anderson went on to graduate from the [[University of Warwick]] with a BA in Film and Literature.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Career==
Anderson made his debut as the writer-director of ''[[Shopping (film)|Shopping]]'', which starred [[Sean Pertwee]], [[Jude Law]] and [[Sadie Frost]] as thieves who smashed cars into storefronts. When released in the United Kingdom it was banned in some cinemas, and only gained a release in the United States as an edited, direct to video release.

After this, he directed the 1995 video game adaptation ''[[Mortal Kombat (film)|Mortal Kombat]]''. While prior video game movies, like ''[[Street Fighter (film)|Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'', had been all-out disasters, ''Mortal Kombat'' was well received by fans, and some critics. He declined to direct the sequel, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', which was not well received by critics or fans. Anderson was asked to direct a third movie, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation#Mortal Kombat: Devastation|Mortal Kombat: Devastation]]'', but declined again because he was too busy filming ''Resident Evil''.

The success of ''Mortal Kombat'' gave Anderson free rein to choose his next project, ''[[Soldier (1998 American film)|Soldier]]'', written by ''[[Blade Runner]]'' screenwriter [[David Webb Peoples]]. Intended as a "[[Sequel#Sidequel|sidequel]]" to ''Blade Runner'', the movie was set in the same universe (but not the same planet), and contained numerous references to the earlier film. [[Kurt Russell]] was attached to star, but was unavailable at the time, which delayed the production. In the meantime, Anderson made the science fiction horror film ''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]''. It was poorly received at the box office, and Anderson blamed the failure on studio-enforced cuts. While not a box-office success, the film gained a small [[cult following]].<ref>[http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/eventhorizonce.php DVD Verdict Review- Event Horizon]</ref> ''Soldier'' was eventually completed and released in 1998, but was a disaster both commercially and critically.

After the poor performance of both ''Event Horizon'' and ''Soldier'', Anderson was forced to think smaller. His planned remake of the [[cult film]] ''[[Death Race 2000]]'' was put on hold, and he set about writing and directed a TV movie, ''The Sight'', in 2000. It was a minor success, and Anderson returned to cinema screens in 2002 when he wrote and directed an adaptation of the [[survival horror]] video game series ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]''. At that point he began to credit himself as "Paul W. S. Anderson", to avoid confusion with the American director [[Paul Thomas Anderson]]. In comparison to his earlier movies, ''Resident Evil'' was produced on a moderate budget of $33,000,000 and became a commercial success in cinemas and on DVD with $102,441,078 at the box office. Anderson then wrote, but did not direct, the sequels ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'', both of which were commercial successes.

Anderson's next project was the much-anticipated ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'', a concept popularised by a series of [[Dark Horse Comics]] and hinted at in ''[[Predator 2]]''. A movie version had been stuck in [[development hell]] for several years despite the franchise crossing into every other form of media, from books to [[comic book|comics]] to video games. The film was finally released in August 2004, grossing $172,544,654<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=avp.htm |title=Alien Vs. Predator (2004) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref> internationally on a budget of $60 million, but received mostly negative reviews. Screenwriter [[Peter Briggs]], who had penned the very first ''Alien vs. Predator'' screenplay, disputed some of Anderson's comments about the production in an online interview, saying Anderson's claim that Briggs' original screenplay was "locked down" was incorrect, and that many elements of Anderson's screenplay were suspiciously similar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/2432 |publisher=BD Horror News |title='AvP' Writer Peter Briggs Responds to Paul Anderson!! |date=29 August 2004}}</ref> A sequel was made, called ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'', in which Anderson was not involved.

After completing ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' Anderson resumed work on his planned ''[[Death Race 2000]]'' remake, which was released as simply ''[[Death Race (film)|Death Race]]'' in 2008. Two straight-to-video prequels were made, ''[[Death Race 2]]'' in 2011, which Anderson wrote but did not direct, and ''[[Death Race 3: Inferno]]'' in 2013, which Anderson only produced and bridges the gap between the first prequel and the original film. In 2010, Anderson wrote and directed the fourth instalment in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film franchise]], ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife]]''.

Anderson directed the 2011 adaptation of ''[[The Three Musketeers (2011 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'', who were played by [[Logan Lerman]], [[Matthew Macfadyen]], [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]], and [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=27840|title=Paul WS Anderson Casts His Musketeers}}</ref>

Anderson wrote and directed the fifth installment in the ''Resident Evil'' film franchise, ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]''. In March 2013, it was announced that Anderson will direct the sixth and final instalment of the ''Resident Evil'' film franchise.<ref>{{cite web |title= Paul W. S.

==Personal life==
In April 2007, ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine announced that Anderson and actress [[Milla Jovovich]], who met when Anderson directed her in the first ''Resident Evil'' film, were expecting a baby girl in November 2007. They were engaged in March 2009 and were married on 22 August 2009.<ref>{{cite news | first = Emily | last = Fromm | title = Milla Jovovich, Paul Anderson Expecting a Baby | url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20036404,00.html | work=People.com  | publisher = Time Inc. | date = 23 April 2007 | accessdate = 17 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.yourtango.com/200935262/milla-jovovich-marries-paul-w-s-anderson |title= Milla Jovovich Marries Paul W.
