'''Herb Jeffries''' (born '''Umberto Alexander Valentino'''; September 24, 1913 – May 25, 2014) was an American actor and [[popular music]] and [[jazz]] singer.

In the 1940s and 1950s Jeffries recorded for a number of labels, including [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]], Exclusive, [[Coral Records|Coral]], [[Decca Records|Decca]], [[Bethlehem Records|Bethlehem]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] and [[Trend Records|Trend]]. His album ''Jamaica'', recorded by [[RKO/Unique Records|RKO]], is a concept album of self-composed calypso songs.

==Early life and ethnicity==

Firm evidence of Jeffries’s race and age is hard to come by, but [[census]] documents from 1920 described him as [[mulatto]] and listed his father as a black man named Howard Jeffrey. Jeffries himself, late in life, said that his father, Howard Jeffrey, was actually his stepfather, and that his biological father was Domenico Balentino, a Sicilian who died in [[World War I]].<ref name=nytimes/>

Jeffries once characterized himself in an interview as "three-eighths Negro", claiming pride in an [[African-American]] heritage during a period when many light-skinned black performers were attempting "[[Passing (racial identity)|to pass]]" as all-white in an effort to broaden their commercial appeal. In marked contrast, Jeffries used [[make-up]] to darken his skin in order to pursue a career in jazz and to be seen as employable by the leading all-black musical ensembles of the day.<ref name="BBC"/>

However, much later in his career, Jeffries would assume the identify of a white citizen for economic or highly personal reasons. ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' reported that Jeffries identified himself as White and stated his "real" name as "Herbert Jeffrey Ball" on an application in order to marry [[Tempest Storm]] in 1959.<ref name="Jet">Johnson, John H., ed. "[http://books.google.com/books?id=mkEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=herb+jeffries Herb Jeffries Lists Self 'White']". ''Jet''. June 11, 1959. pp. 48–49; accessed March 22, 2013.</ref> Jeffries told the reporter for ''Jet'': {{bq|text="... I'm not [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]], I never have, I never will.

Suddenly I decided to fill in the blank the way I look and feel.<br /><br />Look at my blue eyes, look at my brown hair, look at my color. What color do you see?" he demand to know. "My mother was 100 per cent white," Jeffries said, his blue eyes glinting in the New York sun. "My father is Portuguese, Spanish, American Indian, and Negro. How in the hell can I identify myself as one race or another?"<ref name="Jet"/>}}

Raised in Detroit, Jeffries grew up "a ghetto baby"<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10964481/Herb-Jeffries-obituary.html|title= Herb Jeffries-obituary|date=July 13, 2014|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref> in a mixed neighborhood without experiencing severe racism as a child. In the aftermath of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] he dropped out of high school to earn a living as a singer.<ref name=telegraph/> He showed definitive interest in singing during his formative teenage years and was often found hanging out with the Howard Buntz Orchestra at various Detroit ballrooms.<ref name=IMDB/> Intensely musical from boyhood, he began performing in a local [[speakeasy]] where he caught the attention of [[Louis Armstrong]], who gave the teenager a note of recommendation for [[Erskine Tate]] at the [[Savoy Ballroom (Chicago)|Savoy Ballroom]] in Chicago. Knowing that Tate fronted an all-black band, Jeffries claimed to be a [[Creole peoples|Creole]], and was offered a position as a featured singer three nights a week. Later he toured with [[Earl Hines|Earl "Fatha" Hines]]'s Orchestra in the [[Deep South]].<ref name=telegraph/>

A 2007 [[documentary film|documentary]] [[short film|short]] describes Jeffries as "assuming the identity of a man of color" early in his career.<ref name="Bailey">{{cite web| first1= Betty |last1= Bailey |first2= Carol |last2= Lynde |url= http://myhero.com/go/films/view_quicktime.asp?film=Herb%20Jeffries |title= Black/White & All That Jazz |publisher= Tall Paul Productions |year= 2007 |accessdate= 22 March 2013}}</ref> He is shown in ''Black/White & All That Jazz'' explaining that he was inspired by [[New Orleans]]-born musician [[Louis Armstrong]] to say falsely, at a job interview in Chicago, that he was "a [[Louisiana Creole people|Creole from Louisiana]]" when he was of Irish and Sicilian heritage, among other ethnic backgrounds.<ref name="Bailey"/>

==Music career==
From Detroit, at the urging of [[Louis Armstrong]], he moved to [[Chicago]] where he performed in various clubs. One of his first gigs was in a club allegedly owned by [[Al Capone]].<ref name=IMDB/> Jeffries began his career working with [[Erskine Tate]] and his Vendome Orchestra.Tate signed the 19-year-old Jeffries to a contract with his Orchestra at the Savoy Ballroom in Chicago.<ref name=IMDB/> His break came during the 1933 Chicago [[World's Fair]] [[Century of Progress|A Century of Progress International Exposition]] singing with the [[Earl Hines]] Orchestra on Hines’ national broadcasts live from the [[Grand Terrace Cafe]]. His first recordings were with Hines in 1934, including "Just to be in Carolina".<ref name=independent>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/herb-jeffries-leading-man-in-a-string-of-allblack-cowboy-films-who-also-sang-with-the-duke-ellington-orchestra-9449561.html|title= Herb Jeffries: Leading man in a string of all-black cowboy films who also sang with the Duke Ellington Orchestra|date=May 29, 2014|publisher=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> By 1940, he was singing with the [[Duke Ellington]] Orchestra and then recorded with him from 1940 to 1942. His 1940 recording of "Flamingo" with Ellington, released in 1941,  sold more than 14 million copies in its day. His name had been Herbert Jeffrey, but the credits on the record mistakenly called him Jeffries, so he renamed himself to match the typo.<ref name=nytimes/> "Flamingo" was later covered by a white singer, the popular vocalist [[Tony Martin (American singer)|Tony Martin]].<ref name=legacy/> During his time with the Duke Ellington Orchestra as a lead vocalist, Jeffries proved his talent as a mature singer, demonstrating his wide vocal range in such songs as "I Don’t Know What Kind of Blues I’ve Got," "The Brownskin Gal," and "Jump for Joy" (all 1941).<ref name=telegraph/> The 1944 single "My Little Brown Book" by Ellington and his Famous Orchestra, on which Jeffries provided vocals, reached No. 4 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]].<ref name="whitburnr&b"/> Later on, Jeffries was replaced in the Ellington's band by [[Al Hibbler]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} 

In his teens, Jeffries had developed a fine voice, initially singing in higher [[register (music)|registers]].<ref name=independent/> He started out his singing career as a [[tenor|lyrical tenor]], but, on the advice of Duke Ellington's longtime music arranger, [[Billy Strayhorn]], he lowered his range to mimic the vocal stylings of crooner [[Bing Crosby]]. Jeffries became a "silken, lusty [[baritone]]," according to music critic Jonny Whiteside.<ref name=IMDB/><ref>http://www.herbjeffries.com/latimes.html</ref>

In 1945, Jeffries had a hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B chart]] with "Left A Good Deal In Mobile" (No. 2), on which he was accompanied by pianist [[Joe Liggins]] and his band Honeydrippers.<ref name="whitburnr&b">{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin |page=297}}</ref>
Then, he moved to Europe and performed there for many years, including at nightclubs he owned. He was back in America by the 1950s, recording jazz records again, including 1957 collection of ballads, "Say It Isn’t So."<ref name=nytimes/>

In 1995, at age 81, he recorded ''The Bronze Buckaroo (Rides Again)'', a [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] album of songs on the [[Warner Music Group|Warner Western]] label.<ref name="WB image" />

==Film career==
Touring the Deep South with Hines, Jeffries was struck by the realities of segregation, as the Orchestra’s playing was restricted to tobacco warehouses and black-only movie theatres. Watching young boys fill theatres to watch the latest western, Jeffries resolved to create a cowboy hero geared specifically for such an audience.<ref name=telegraph/> A self-confessed western buff who had grown up watching the silent escapades of [[Tom Mix]] and [[Jack Holt (actor)|Jack Holt]], in the 1930s Jeffries set out to produce a low-budget western with an all-black cast. Though the silent era had seen a number of films starring only black actors, they had all but disappeared with the economic downturn and the arrival of the [[Sound film|talkies]], which proved too expensive for many of the "white independents" funding such projects. Jeffries’s ambition was to produce sound cinema’s "first all-Negro musical western". To fund his project, Jeffries approached a veteran B-movie producer named [[Jed Buell]]. Jeffries, having obtained finances, wrote his own songs for the film<ref name=hollywoodreporter.com/> and hired [[Spencer Williams]] to appear with him. When Buell wanted to know of a likely candidate for the lead role, Jeffries nominated himself. Having grown up partly on his grandfather’s farm, he had all the requisite horse-riding and roping skills, beside a fine singing voice, but Buell expressed concerns; Jeffries, whose mother was of Irish descent, was "not black enough". Eventually they went ahead, using make-up to darken the leading man’s skin tone.
Jeffries made his debut as a crooning cowboy with ''[[Harlem on the Prairie]]'', which was considered the first black western following the inauguration of the talkies<ref name=IMDB/> and the first sound Western with an all-black cast.<ref name=hollywoodreporter.com/> The movie was shot in 1937 over five days at N.B. Murray's [[guest ranch|dude ranch]] near Victorville, California, with Jeffries performing all his own stunts. Though critical reception was mixed, the film received a write-up in [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine and grossed [[United States dollar|$]]50,000 in its first 12 months. Playing a singing cowboy in low-budget films, Jeffries became known as the "Bronze Buckaroo" by his fans. In a time of [[American racial segregation]], such "[[race movie]]s" played mostly in theaters catering to African-American audiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicimages.com/people/article_32260f27-7f80-596e-b618-19540a410fff.html |title=Hats off to a Happy Cowboy: A Salute to Herb Jeffries |accessdate=2010-07-04 |last=Halper |first=Donna L. |work=Classic Images |quote=In addition to being the first all-black singing cowboy film, ''Harlem on the Prairie'' was unique in other ways. Black films usually played in black theaters only. (One estimate is that there were as many as 500 black theaters nation-wide at the time when Herb Jeffries' first movie came out.) This film was not only shown in segregated movie houses; it was also shown in East and West Coast theaters where the audiences were mainly white.}}</ref> The films include ''[[Harlem on the Prairie (film)|Harlem on the Prairie]]'', ''[[The Bronze Buckaroo]]'', ''[[Harlem Rides the Range]]'' and ''[[Two-Gun Man from Harlem]]''.

Jeffries went on to star in another three musical westerns over the next two years.<ref name=telegraph/> Jeffries starred as a singing cowboy, in several all-black [[Western films]], in which he sang his own [[Country music|western]] compositions. In those films, Jeffries starred as cowboy Bob Blake, sang and performed his own stunts. Bob Blake was the good guy, with a thin mustache, who wore a white Stetson and rode a white horse named Stardusk.<ref name=legacy/><ref name=hollywoodreporter.com/>

Jeffries went on to make other films, starring in the title film role of Calypso Joe co-starring [[Angie Dickinson]] in ''Calypso Joe'' (1957). In 1968, Jeffries appeared in the long-running western TV series ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' playing a gunslinger who intimidated the town. In the 1970s he appeared on episodes of "I Dream of Jeannie" and "Hawaii Five-0".<ref name=IMDB/> He later directed and produced ''Mundo depravados'', a [[cult following|cult]] film starring his wife, [[Tempest Storm]].

==Honors and legacy==
But Herb Jeffries, as a velvet-toned jazz baritone and sometime actor was (and perhaps still is) virtually unknown to white audiences. Yet, back in the late 1930s and early 1940s, Jeffries was very big...in black-cast films. Today he is respected and remembered as a pioneer who broke down rusted-shut racial doors in Hollywood and ultimately displayed a positive image as a black actor on celluloid.<ref name=IMDB/>

For his contributions to the [[motion picture industry]], Jeffries has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6672 [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. In 2004 he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. In 1998 a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>[http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated]</ref>

Jeffries was described as the only black singing cowboy star in [[Hollywood]] history and, more recently, after the deaths of [[Gene Autry]], [[Roy Rogers]] and others, as the "last of the singing cowboys."<ref name=legacy/>

==Personal life==
His four marriages (including one to [[exotic dancer]] [[Tempest Storm]]) produced five children.

In 2007, while assembling material for the producers of a documentary film about him (''A Colored Life''), Jeffries found his birth certificate; this reminded him that he actually was born in 1913 and that he had misrepresented his age after he left home to look for a job.

He appeared at jazz festivals and events benefiting [[autism]] and other developmental problems and lectured at colleges and universities. He supported [[music education]] in schools. In June 2010, aged 96, Jeffries performed to raise funds for the [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside (California)]] Unified School District's music program, accompanied by the [[Big Band Jazz Hall of Fame Orchestra]] under the direction of clarinetist [[Tad Calcara]]. This benefit concert was his second (the previous concert was in 2001).{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In later years, he resided in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]].<ref name="Centenary"/> He died of heart failure at [[West Hills, Los Angeles|West Hills]] Hospital and Medical Center on May 25, 2014.<ref name=hollywoodreporter.com/><ref>{{cite news| url= http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-80312725/ |first= Dennis |last= McLellan |title= Herb Jeffries dies at 100; Hollywood's first black singing cowboy |newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date= 26 May 2014}}</ref>
