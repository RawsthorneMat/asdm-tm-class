'''Sir David Lean''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (25 March 1908{{spaced ndash}}16 April 1991) was an English film director, producer, screenwriter and editor, best remembered for big-screen [[epic film|epics]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Roland|first=Bergan|title=Film|year=2006|publisher=Doring Kindersley|location=80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL|isbn=978-1-4053-1280-6|page=321}}</ref> such as ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957), ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962), and ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1965); for perhaps the most highly regarded of all the adaptations of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]' novels, ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' (1946) and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (1948); and for the renowned [[romance film|romantic drama]] ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' (1945).

==Early life and education==
Lean was born in [[Croydon]], Surrey (now part of [[Greater London]]), to Francis William le Blount Lean and the former Helena Tangye (niece of [[Richard Tangye|Sir Richard Trevithick Tangye]]). His parents were [[Quaker]]s and he was a pupil at the Quaker-founded [[Leighton Park School]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. His younger brother, [[Edward Tangye Lean]] (1911–1974), founded the original [[Inklings]] literary club when a student at [[Oxford University]]. Lean was a half-hearted schoolboy with a dreamy nature who was labeled a "dud"<ref name=Smith /> of a student; he left in his mid-teens<ref>http://davidleancroydon.org.uk/about/croydon/</ref> and entered his father's chartered accountancy firm as an apprentice. A more shaping event for his career than his formal education had been an uncle's gift, when Lean was aged ten, of a [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie box camera]].  "You usually didn't give a boy a camera until he was 16 or 17 in those days. It was a huge compliment and I succeeded at it.' Lean  printed and developed his films, and it was his 'great hobby'.<ref> the Guardian, April 17 , 1991</ref>  At age 16, his father deserted the family when he ran off with another woman, and Lean would later follow a similar path after his own first marriage and child.<ref name=Smith />

==Period as film editor==
Bored by his work, Lean spent every evening in the cinema, and in 1927, after an aunt had advised him to find a job he enjoyed doing, he went to [[Gaumont British|Gaumont Studios]] where his obvious enthusiasm earned him a month's trial without pay. He was taken on as a teaboy, promoted to clapperboy, and soon rose to the position of [[Assistant director|third assistant director]]. By 1930 he was working as an editor on [[newsreels]], including those of [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont Pictures]] and [[Movietone News|Movietone]], while his move to feature films began with ''[[Freedom of the Seas (film)|Freedom of the Seas]]'' (1934) and ''[[Escape Me Never (1935 film)|Escape Me Never]]'' (1935).

He edited [[Gabriel Pascal]]'s film productions of two [[George Bernard Shaw]] plays, ''[[Pygmalion (1938 film)|Pygmalion]]'' (1938) and ''[[Major Barbara (film)|Major Barbara]]'' (1941). He edited [[Powell and Pressburger|Powell & Pressburger's]] ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (1941) and ''[[One of Our Aircraft Is Missing]]'' (1942). After this last film, Lean began his directing career, after editing more than two dozen features by 1942. As [[Anthony Sloman|Tony Sloman]] wrote in 1999, "As the varied likes of David Lean, [[Robert Wise]], [[Terence Fisher]] and [[Dorothy Arzner]] have proved, the cutting rooms are easily the finest grounding for film direction."<ref>Sloman, Tony (1999). [http://cinescale.20m.com/obit1.html "Obituary: Harold Kress"], ''The Independent'', 26 October 1999. Online version retrieved 8 April 2009.</ref> David Lean was given honorary membership of the [[GBFTE|Guild of British Film Editors]] in 1968.

==British films==
His first work as a director was in collaboration with [[Noël Coward]] on ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' (1942), and he later adapted several of Coward's plays into successful films. These included ''[[This Happy Breed (film)|This Happy Breed]]'' (1944), ''[[Blithe Spirit (film)|Blithe Spirit]]'' (1945) and ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' (1945).

Two celebrated [[Charles Dickens]] adaptations followed – ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' (1946) and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (1948). The two Dickens films were the first directed by Lean to star [[Alec Guinness]], whom Lean considered his "good luck charm". The actor's portrayal of Fagin was controversial at the time. The first screening in Berlin during February 1949 offended the surviving Jewish community and led to a riot. It caused problems too in New York, and after private screenings, was condemned by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the American Board of Rabbis. "To our surprise it was accused of being anti-Semitic", Lean wrote. "We made Fagin an outsize and, we hoped, an amusing Jewish villain."<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bKtQTBGaB3wC&pg=PA136&lpg=PA135 ''Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean''], University Press of Kentucky, 2006, pp.135–36</ref> The terms of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|production code]] meant that the film's release in the United States was delayed until July 1951 after cuts amounting to eight minutes.<ref>Phillips, p.139</ref>

The next film directed by Lean was ''[[The Passionate Friends]]'' (1949), an atypical Lean film, but one which marked his first occasion to work with [[Claude Rains]], who later appeared in ''Lawrence of Arabia''. ''The Passionate Friends'', ''[[Madeleine (1950 film)|Madeleine]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Sound Barrier]]'' (1952) featured his third wife, the actress [[Ann Todd]]. The last of these had a screenplay by the playwright [[Terence Rattigan]] and was the first of his three films for [[Alexander Korda|Sir Alexander Korda]]'s [[London Films]]. ''[[Hobson's Choice (1954 film)|Hobson's Choice]]'' (1954), with [[Charles Laughton]] in the lead, was based on the play by [[Harold Brighouse]].

==International films==
[[File:DavidLean1965.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lean in Northern [[Finland]] in 1965 while shooting ''Doctor Zhivago''.]]
''[[Summertime (1955 film)|Summertime]]'' (1955) marked a new departure for Lean. It was partly American financed, although again made for Korda's London Films. The film features [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the lead role as a middle-aged American woman who has a romance while on holiday in [[Venice]]. It was shot entirely on location there.

===For Columbia and Sam Spiegel===
Lean's films now began to become infrequent, but much larger in scale, and more extensively released internationally. ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957) was based on a novel by [[Pierre Boulle]] recounting the story of British and American prisoners of war trying to survive in a Japanese prison camp during World War II. The film stars [[William Holden]] and [[Alec Guinness]] and became the largest box office hit in the United States in 1958. It won several [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].

After extensive location work in the Middle East, North Africa, Spain, and elsewhere, Lean's ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' was released in 1962. The first project of Lean's with a screenplay by playwright [[Robert Bolt]], it recounts the life of [[T. E. Lawrence]], the British officer who united the peoples of the Arab peninsula to fight in the [[World War I|Great War]]. The film turned actor [[Peter O'Toole]] into a star and won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Lean's second win for Best Director. He remains the only British director to win more than one Oscar for directing.

===For MGM===
Lean had his greatest box office success with ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1965), a romance set during the [[Russian Revolution]]. The film, based on the novel by [[Boris Pasternak]], tells the story of a physician and poet ([[Omar Sharif]]) who falls in love with an unavailable woman named Lara ([[Julie Christie]]) and struggles to be with her in the chaos of the revolution and subsequent [[Russian Civil War]]. In addition, Lean directed some scenes of ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965) while [[George Stevens]] was doing location work in Nevada.

In 1970, Lean's ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]'' was finally released after an extended period on location in Ireland. A doomed romance, it is loosely based on [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]''. The film received far fewer positive reviews than the director's previous work, particularly being savaged by the New York critics, and was not a success at the international box office, unlike Lean's earlier epics. Some critics felt the film's massive visual scale and extended running time did not suit its small-scale romantic narrative. Nonetheless, the film won two Academy Awards the following year, for cinematographer [[Freddie Young]] and supporting actor [[John Mills]]. The reception of the film put Lean off making another film for some years.

==Last years and unfulfilled projects==
From 1977 until 1980, Lean and Robert Bolt worked on a film adaptation of ''Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian'', a dramatized account by [[Richard Hough]] of the ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty]]''. It was originally to be released as a two-part film, one named ''The Lawbreakers'' that dealt with the voyage out to Tahiti and the subsequent mutiny, and the second named ''The Long Arm'' that studied the journey of the mutineers after the mutiny as well as the admiralty's response in sending out the frigate [[HMS Pandora (1779)|HMS ''Pandora'']], in which some of the mutineers were imprisoned. Lean could not find financial backing for both films after Warner Bros. withdrew from the project; he decided to combine it into one and looked at a seven-part TV series before getting backing from Italian mogul [[Dino De Laurentiis]]. The project then suffered a further setback when Bolt suffered a serious stroke and was unable to continue writing; the director felt that Bolt's involvement would be crucial to the film's success. [[Melvyn Bragg]] ended up writing a considerable portion of the script.

Lean was forced to abandon the project after overseeing casting and the construction of the $4 million ''Bounty'' replica; at the last possible moment, actor [[Mel Gibson]] brought in his friend [[Roger Donaldson]] to direct the film, as producer De Laurentiis did not want to lose the millions he had already put into the project over what he thought was as insignificant a person as the director dropping out.<ref>[http://lean.bfi.org.uk/material.php?theme=2&title=bounty]{{dead link|date=June 2013}}</ref> The film was eventually released as ''[[The Bounty]]''.

After failing to get ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' into production, Lean embarked on his last completed project as director, ''[[A Passage to India (film)|A Passage to India]]'' (1984), with a screenplay adapted from [[E. M. Forster]]'s  [[A Passage to India|1924 novel]] by Lean himself. For this final film, he chose to return to editing, with the result that his three roles were given precisely equal status in the film's credits.<ref>[[Walter Kerr|Kerr, Walter]] (1985). [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F30A17F8355D0C748DDDAA0894DD484D81 "Films are made in the Cutting Room"], ''New York Times'', 17 March 1985. Online version retrieved 15 November 2007.</ref> Unlike ''Ryan's Daughter'', the film opened to positive reviews, and Lean was nominated for Academy Awards in [[Academy Award for Best Director|directing]], [[Academy Award for Film Editing|editing]], and [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|writing]].

During the last years of his life, Lean was in pre-production of a film version of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Nostromo]]''. He assembled an all-star cast, including [[Marlon Brando]], [[Paul Scofield]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Christopher Lambert]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], and [[Dennis Quaid]], with [[Georges Corraface]] as the title character. Lean also wanted [[Alec Guinness]] to play Doctor Monyghan, but the aged actor turned him down in a letter from 1989: "I believe I would be disastrous casting. The only thing in the part I might have done well is the crippled crab-like walk." [[Steven Spielberg]] came on board as producer with the backing of [[Warner Bros.]], but after several rewrites and disagreements on the script, he left the project and was replaced by [[Serge Silberman]], a respected producer at Greenwich Film Productions.

The project involved several writers, including [[Christopher Hampton]] and [[Robert Bolt]], but their work was abandoned. In the end, Lean decided to write the film himself with the assistance of Maggie Unsworth, with whom he had worked on the scripts for ''Brief Encounter'', ''Great Expectations'', ''Oliver Twist'', and ''The Passionate Friends''. Originally Lean considered filming in [[Mexico]] but later decided to film in London and [[Madrid]], partly to secure O'Toole, who had insisted he would take part only if the film was shot close to home. ''Nostromo'' had a total budget of $46 million and was six weeks away from filming at the time of Lean's death from [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It was rumoured that fellow film director [[John Boorman]] would take over direction, but the production collapsed. ''Nostromo'' was finally adapted for the small screen with an unrelated [[BBC television]] mini-series in 1997.

==Personal life and honours<!-- British subject. -->==
Lean was a long-term resident of [[Limehouse]], east London. His home on Narrow Street is still owned by his family. His co-writer and producer [[Norman Spencer (producer)|Norman Spencer]] has said that Lean was a "huge womaniser" and "to my knowledge, he had almost 1,000 women".<ref name="How we made Hobson's Choice">{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jun/30/how-we-made-hobsons-choice-prunella-scales | title=How we made Hobson's Choice | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=1 July 2014}}</ref> He was married six times, had one son, and at least two grandchildren—from all of whom he was completely estranged<ref name=Collins>{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Andrew|title=The epic legacy of David Lean|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/may/04/features|work=Newspaper feature|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=17 September 2011|location=London|date=4 May 2008}}</ref>—and was divorced five times.

David Lean Foundation (18 July 2005). Retrieved on 2011-05-29.</ref> David Lean received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1990, being one of only three non-Americans to receive the award.

==Reputation and influence==
Lean is the most represented director on the [[BFI Top 100 British films]] list, having a total of seven films on the list. As Lean himself pointed out,<ref>Brownlow, p. 483</ref> his films are often admired by fellow directors as a showcase of the filmmaker's art. [[Steven Spielberg ]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] in particular are fans of Lean's epic films, and claim him as one of their primary influences. Spielberg and Scorsese also helped in the 1989 restoration of ''Lawrence of Arabia'' which, after release, greatly revived Lean's reputation.

[[John Woo]] once named ''Lawrence of Arabia'' among his top three films.<ref>Perce Nev, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/callingtheshots/john_woo.shtml BBC]. Retrieved 17 May 2007</ref> More recently, [[Joe Wright]] (''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'', ''[[Atonement (film)|Atonement]]'') has cited Lean's works, particularly ''Doctor Zhivago'', as an important influence on his work.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article4066844.ece ''Times Online'' report]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref>
