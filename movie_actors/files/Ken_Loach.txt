'''Kenneth "Ken" Loach''' (born 17 June 1936) is an English film and television director.

He is known for his naturalistic, [[social realism|social realist]] directing style and for his [[socialism]], which are evident in his film treatment of social issues such as [[homelessness]] (''[[Cathy Come Home]]'') and [[Labor rights|labour rights]] (''[[Riff-Raff (1991 film)|Riff-Raff]]'' and ''[[The Navigators (film)|The Navigators]]'').

==Life and career==
Loach was born in [[Nuneaton]], [[Warwickshire]], the son of Vivien (née Hamlin) and John Loach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/10/Ken-Loach.html |title=Ken Loach Biography (1936-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref>

Loach's ten contributions to the BBC's ''[[The Wednesday Play|Wednesday Play]]'' anthology series include the docudramas ''[[Up the Junction (The Wednesday Play)|Up the Junction]]'' (1965), ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' (1966) and ''[[In Two Minds]]'' (1967). They portray working-class people in conflict with the authorities above them. Three of his early plays are believed to be [[lost film]]s.<ref name="Controversies"/> ''Up the Junction'', adapted by [[Nell Dunn]] from her book with the assistance of Loach, deals with an illegal abortion while the leading characters in ''Cathy Comes Home'', by [[Jeremy Sandford]], are affected by homelessness, unemployment, and the workings of Social Services. ''In Two Minds'', written by [[David Mercer (playwright)|David Mercer]], concerns a young [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] woman's experiences of the mental health system. [[Tony Garnett]] began to work as his producer in this period, a professional connection which would last until the end of the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/28/tony-garnett-mother-backstreet-abortion-death|title= Up the Junction's Tony Garnett reveals mother's backstreet abortion death|author= Jason Deans and Maggie Brown	|publisher= [[The Guardian]] |date = April 28, 2013}}</ref>

Coinciding with his work for ''The Wednesday Play'', Loach began to direct feature films for the cinema, with ''[[Poor Cow]]'' (1967) and ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' (1970). The latter recounts the story of a troubled boy and his [[Common Kestrel|kestrel]], and is based on the novel ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'' by [[Barry Hines]]. The British Film Institute named it No 7 in its list of best British films of the twentieth century, published in 1999.<ref>[http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/bfi100 A selection of the favourite British films of the 20th century]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>

During the 1970s and '80s, Loach's films were less successful, often suffering from poor distribution, lack of interest and political censorship. His documentary ''[[The Save the Children Fund Film]]'' (1971) was commissioned by [[Save the Children Fund|the charity]], who subsequently disliked it so much they attempted to have the negative destroyed. In fact, it was only screened publicly for the first time on 1 September 2011, at the BFI Southbank.<ref>Stephen Bates [http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jul/20/ken-loach-documentary-first-screening "Ken Loach documentary to get first screening after 40 years",] ''The Guardian'', 20 July 2011</ref>  Loach concentrated on television documentaries rather than fiction during the 1980s, and many of these films are now rare as the television companies have never released them on video or DVD.<ref name="TimeOut">[http://www.timeout.com/london/film/ken-loach-interview-3 Time Out interview with Ken Loach]</ref>  At the end of the 1980s, Loach directed some television advertisements for Tennent's Lager to earn money.<ref name="TimeOut"/>

In 1982, Loach and [[Central Independent Television]] were commissioned by [[Channel 4]] to make ''Questions of Leadership'', a documentary series on the response of the [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|British trade union movement]] to the challenge posed by the policies of the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government, which gave trade union members an opportunity to call their own leaders to account. The programmes were not broadcast by Channel 4, a decision Loach claimed was politically motivated. [[Anthony Hayward]]'s book ''Which Side Are You On? Ken Loach and His Films'' (2004)<ref>Anthony Hayward ''Which Side Are You On? Ken Loach and His Films'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2004</ref> claims that the media tycoon [[Robert Maxwell]] had put pressure on Central's board, of which he had become a director, to withdraw ''Questions of Leadership'' at the time he was buying the ''Daily Mirror'' newspaper and needed the co-operation of union leaders, especially [[Frank Chapple]] of the electricians.

''Which Side Are You On?'' (1985), about the songs and poems of the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|UK miners' strike]], was originally due to be broadcast on ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', but was rejected on the grounds that it was too politically unbalanced for an arts show.<ref name="Loach">[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/530268/index.html BFI Screenonline: Which side are you on?]</ref>  The film was eventually transmitted on Channel 4, but only after it won a prize at an Italian film festival.<ref name="Loach"/>  Three weeks after the end of the strike, the film ''End of the Battle... Not the End of the War?'' was broadcast on the ''[[Diverse Strands]]'' series of Channel 4.<ref name="DiverseStrands">[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1416263/index.html BFI Screenonline: End of the Battle... Not the End of the War?]</ref>  This film argued that the Conservative Party had planned the destruction of the NUM's political power from the late 1970s.<ref name="DiverseStrands"/>

Working with writer [[Jim Allen (playwright)|Jim Allen]], Loach was due to direct a play named ''[[Perdition (play)|Perdition]]'', which suggested that Zionists in Hungary collaborated with the Nazis to help the operation of the [[Holocaust]] in return for allowing a few Jews to emigrate to [[Palestine]].<ref name="JimAllen">[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/531525/ BFI Screenonline: Allen, Jim]</ref>  The play was due to run at the Royal Court in 1987, but its run was cancelled 36 hours before the first night, following widespread protests and allegations of anti-Semitism.<ref name="TimeOut"/><ref name="JimAllen"/>

The late 1980s and 1990s saw the production of a series of films such as ''Hidden Agenda'', dealing with the political troubles in Northern Ireland, ''Carla's Song'' set partially in Nicaragua, and ''Land and Freedom'' examining the Republican resistance in the Spanish Civil War. He directed the Courtroom Drama reconstructions in the docu-film ''[[McLibel (film)|McLibel]]'', concerning the [[McDonald's Restaurants v Morris & Steel|longest libel trial]] in English history. Interspersed with political films were smaller dramas such as ''Raining Stones'' a working class drama concerning an unemployed man's efforts to buy a communion dress for his young daughter.

On 28 May 2006, Loach won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]] for his film ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]'',<ref name="cannes-2006.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4336504/year/2006.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Wind That Shakes the Barley |accessdate=13 December 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> a film about the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Irish Civil War]] during the 1920s. In characteristic fashion this sweeping political-historical drama was followed by ''It's a Free World'' a story of one woman's attempt to establish an illegal placement service for migrant workers in London. Throughout the 2000s Loach continued to intersperse wider political dramas such as ''Bread and Roses'' (which focused on the Los Angeles janitors strike) and ''Route Irish'' (set in the Iraq occupation) with smaller examinations of personal relationships.  ''Ae Fond Kiss'' explored an inter-racial love affair, ''Sweet Sixteen'' a teenager's relationship with his mother, and ''My Name is Joe'' an alcoholic's struggle to stay sober. His most commercially successful recent film is 2009's ''[[Looking for Eric]]'', featuring a depressed postman's conversations with the ex-Manchester United football star, Eric Cantona (played by Cantona himself).  The film won the [[Magritte Award for Best Co-Production]]. Although successful in Manchester, the film was a flop in many other cities, especially cities with rival football teams to Manchester United.<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1418438/ Ken Loach - the controversies]</ref>

In 2011 he released ''Route Irish'', an examination of private contractors working in the Iraqi occupation. A thematic consistency throughout his films, whether they examine broad political situations, or smaller intimate dramas, is his focus on personal relationships. The sweeping political dramas (''Land and Freedom'', ''Bread and Roses'', ''The Wind that Shakes the Barley'') examine wider political forces in the context of relationships between family members (''Bread and Roses'', ''The Wind that Shakes the Barley'', ''Carla's Song''), comrades in struggle (''Land and Freedom'') or close friends (''Route Irish''). In a 2011 interview for the ''Financial Times'', Loach explains how "The politics are embedded into the characters and the narrative, which is a more sophisticated way of doing it".<ref>[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/ft/2011/08/ken_loach.2.html]</ref>

His 2013 film ''[[The Angels' Share]]'' centres around a young Scottish troublemaker who is given one final opportunity to stay out of jail. Newcomer Paul Brannigan, 24, from Glasgow, plays the lead role.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hudson|first=David|title=Ken Loach at 75|url=http://mubi.com/notebook/posts/ken-loach-75|publisher=MUBI}}</ref> The film competed for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name="Official Selection">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/article/58878.html |title=2012 Official Selection |accessdate=19 April 2012 |work=Cannes}}</ref><ref name="timeout">{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2547/cannes-film-festival-2012-line-up-announced |title=Cannes Film Festival 2012 line-up announced |accessdate=19 April 2012 |work=timeout}}</ref> where Loach won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]].<ref name="PalmeDor2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/2012/awardCompetition.html |title=Awards 2012 |accessdate=27 May 2012|work=Cannes}}</ref>

Loach lives with his wife, Lesley, in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. His son [[Jim Loach]] has also become a television and film director.

== Film style==
[[File:Ken Loach Cannes.jpg|thumb|upright|Ken Loach at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
Loach's film work is characterised by a particular view of [[Realism (arts)|realism]]; he strives in every area of filmmaking to emphasise genuine interplay between actors, to the point where some scenes in his films appear unscripted. All scenes are carefully scripted, around which some improvisation can occur. The final script and the final film are actually very close. Loach values having a strong, creative partnership with scriptwriters, most recently with [[Paul Laverty]], who has written nine feature films for Loach (including ''The Wind That Shakes The Barley'' and ''Sweet Sixteen''), and previously with [[Jim Allen (playwright)|Jim Allen]] (''Land & Freedom'') and [[Barry Hines]] (''Kes'').

In May 2010, Loach told Tom Lamont in an interview about the three films that have influenced him most: [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), [[Miloš Forman]]'s ''[[Loves of a Blonde]]'' (1965) and [[Gillo Pontecorvo]]'s ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' (1966). De Sica's film had a particularly profound effect on Loach. He noted "It made me realise that cinema could be about ordinary people and their dilemmas. It wasn't a film about stars, or riches or absurd adventures."<ref>{{cite news|title=Films that changed my life: Ken Loach|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/may/16/bicycle-thieves-ken-loach|publisher=The Observer|accessdate=May 2010|location=London|first=Tom|last=Lamont}}</ref>  
 
Rather than employing method actors, he prefers unknown talent who have had some of the life experience of the characters they portray. Loach's film work has been described as naturalistic; he emphasises the genuine interplay between actors, and foregoes over-dependence on special effects. He succeeds in creating a spontaneous, realistic atmosphere in scenes and many actors, from [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Robert Duvall]] to [[Robert Carlyle]] (''[[Carla's Song]]'' and ''[[Riff-Raff (1991 film)|Riff-Raff]]'') and [[Peter Mullan]] (''[[My Name Is Joe]]'') have praised the performances he coaxes from actors and how he treats them.

In ''[[Bread and Roses (2000 film)|Bread and Roses]]'', a film about immigrant cleaners in LA, many of the extras were Latino immigrant cleaners. Some were also trade union and grassroots activists. Some knew from their own experience the dangers of crossing the border into the US. [[Adrien Brody]], the main actor, spent time with activists to understand his role better. [[Pilar Padilla]], a Mexican actress and protagonist of the film, had to learn English in a crash course to play the part.

Loach makes great efforts to help the actors express themselves naturally and honestly. He believes that shooting in order, from first scene to last, helps the actors to find a response to their circumstances. Many actors in his films are often not given the full script at the beginning of a shoot, but rather they experience the story just as a fictional character might do. He will often give actors their scenes a couple of days in advance so they can learn their lines, but they still won't know what comes after that. If a scene involves shock or surprise for a character, the actor might not know what is about to happen. In ''Kes'' the boy actor, discovering the dead bird at the end, believed Loach had killed the bird, which he had become fond of during the filming (the crew used a dead bird found elsewhere). In the scene where Mr Gryce is searching the schoolboys, the small first year holding everybody else's cigarettes was under the impression that he was to give the headmaster a note and leave the office. Subsequently, when he is searched and found to be "a right little cigarette factory", he is caned alongside the other boys; hence, his look of shock and tears of pain are real. In ''Ladybird, Ladybird'', in the scene where Maggie rushes to the fire at the refuge where her children are staying, actress [[Crissy Rock]] had no idea what the scene entailed until she turned the corner and saw the burning building. In ''Raining Stones'' one of the actresses visited at her house by a [[loan shark]] had no idea that he was going to force her to take off her wedding ring and give it to him as part payment. In ''Carla's Song'', the bus driver, played by Robert Carlyle, knew nothing of Carla's attempted suicide until he discovered her in the bath. In ''Looking For Eric'', the main actor [[Steve Evets]] discovered that football icon [[Eric Cantona]] was in the film only when he turned around to face him in a scene, with the camera rolling.

Many of Loach's films include a large amount of traditional [[dialect]], such as the [[Yorkshire dialect]] in ''Kes'' and in ''[[The Price of Coal]]'', the Glaswegian dialect in ''[[My Name is Joe]]'', the dialect of [[Greenock]] (in Scotland) in ''Sweet Sixteen'', and a variety of accents in ''Riff Raff''.  Many of these films have been subtitled when shown in other English-speaking countries.<ref name="Dialectologica"/>  When asked about this in an interview with Cineaste, Loach replied:
{{quote|If you ask people to speak differently, you lose more than the voice. Everything about them changes. If I asked you not to speak with an American accent, your whole personality would change. That’s how you are. My hunch is that it’s better to use subtitles than not, even if that limits the films to an art-house circuit.<ref name="Dialectologica">[http://www.publicacions.ub.es/revistes/ejecuta_descarga.asp?codigo=561  Dialect in Films: Examples of South Yorkshire.]  Grammatical and Lexical Features from Ken Loach Films, Dialectologica 3, page 6</ref>}}

Loach opposes censorship in cinema and was outraged at the "18" certificate given to ''[[Sweet Sixteen (2002 film)|Sweet Sixteen]]''. Loach said,
{{quote|I think it was a very silly decision, such a patronising attitude as well. People are rarely hurt by swear words, yet you see scenes of violence depicted in films often with a 12 certificate. Some of these films have violence for the sake of it, try and push the certification boundaries. I think in my films that the violence is necessary to portray realism, it’s important to the narrative. And yes, it does put a smokescreen on society because it uses violence as a source of entertainment rather than its actual meaning.}}

Loach's style of film-making was gently parodied in an episode of ''[[The All New Alexei Sayle Show]]'' in 1995 which featured a sketch in which Loach directs a new version of ''Superman'' where the title character, despite his super-powers, is a disillusioned, scruffy Yorkshireman who works for 200 years at a [[colliery]].

==Political activities==
Throughout his career Loach's films have been shelved for political reasons. In a 2011 interview with ''The Guardian'' newspaper he said  "It makes you angry, not on your own behalf, but on behalf of the people whose voices weren't allowed to be heard. When you had trade unions, ordinary people, rank and file, never been on television, never been interviewed, and they're not allowed to be heard, that's scandalous. And you see it over and over again. I mean, we heard very little from the kids in the riots. You hear some people being inarticulate in a hood, but very few people were actually allowed to speak".<ref name="Cochrane"/>  In the same interview his focus on working people's lives is explained thus:  "I think the underlying factors regarding the riots are plain for anyone with eyes to see ... It seems to me any economic structure that could give young people a future has been destroyed. Traditionally young people would be drawn into the world of work, and into groups of adults who would send the boys for a lefthanded screwdriver, or a pot of elbow grease, and so they'd be sent up in that way, but they would also learn about responsibilities, and learn a trade, and be defined by their skills. Well, they destroyed that. Thatcher destroyed that. She consciously destroyed the workforces in places like the railways, for example, and the mines, and the steelworks ... so that transition from adolescence to adulthood was destroyed, consciously, and knowingly."

He argues that working people's struggles are inherently dramatic: "They live life very vividly, and the stakes are very high if you don't have a lot of money to cushion your life. Also, because they're the front line of what we came to call the class war. Either through being workers without work, or through being exploited where they were working. And I guess for a political reason, because we felt, and I still think, that if there is to be change, it will come from below. It won't come from people who have a lot to lose, it will come from people who will have everything to gain."<ref name="Cochrane"/>

A member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the early 1960s, Loach left in the mid-1990s.<ref name="Statesman">Amy Raphael [http://www.newstatesman.com/arts-and-culture/2007/09/ken-loach-labour-party-film "The great crusader",] ''New Statesman'', 20 September 2007</ref> In November 2004, he was elected to the national council of the [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect Coalition]].<ref name="Statesman"/> He stood for election to the European Parliament on a [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect]] mandate.

In 2007, Loach was one of more than 100 artists and writers who signed an open letter initiated by [[Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism]] and the [[South West Asian, North African Bay Area Queers]] (SWANABAQ) and calling on the [[Frameline|San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival]] "to honour calls for an [[Economic and political boycotts of Israel|international boycott of Israeli political and cultural institutions]], by discontinuing [[Israel]]i consulate sponsorship of the LGBT film festival and not co-sponsoring events with the Israeli consulate."<ref>Matthew S.

The letter was published in the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' on 8 May 2008."<ref>[http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/pngo140508.html "60 Years of Palestinian Dispossession ... No Reason to Celebrate 'Israel at 60'!"], Mr Zine (''Monthly Review'' Press) website, 17 May 2008.</ref>

Responding to a report, which he described as "a red herring", on the growth of [[antisemitism]] since the beginning of the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War  of 2008-2009]], he has said: "If there has been a rise I am not surprised. In fact, it is perfectly understandable because Israel feeds feelings of anti-Semitism." He added "no-one can condone violence".<ref>[http://www.theparliament.com/latestnews/news-article/newsarticle/eu-wide-rise-in-anti-semitism-described-as-understandable/ "EU-wide rise in anti-Semitism described as 'understandable'"], EU Politics News, 4 March 2009</ref>

In May 2009, organisers of the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] returned a £300 grant from the Israeli Embassy after speaking with Ken Loach. The director was supporting a boycott of the festival called for by the PACBI campaign. 
In response, former Channel 4 chief executive Sir Jeremy Isaacs describing Loach's intervention as an act of censorship, he said: "They must not allow someone who has no real position, no rock to stand on, to interfere with their programming." Later, a spokesman for the EIFF said that although it had returned £300 to the Israeli Embassy, the festival itself would fund Israeli filmmaker Tali Shalom-Ezer's travel to Edinburgh out of its own budget.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6322826.ece Edinburgh film festival bows to pressure from Ken Loach over Israeli boycott], The Times], 20 May 2009</ref><ref>Loach pressure sways Edinburgh festival [http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/a156597/loach-pressure-sways-edinburgh-festival.html] ''Digital Spy'', 20 May 2009.</ref><ref>Edinburgh film festival refuses Israeli grant due to pressure by Ken Loach [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1086876.html] ''Haaretz'', 20 May 2009.</ref> In an open letter to Ms Shalom Ezer, Ken Loach wrote "From the beginning, Israel and its supporters have attacked their critics as anti-semites or racists. It is a tactic to undermine rational debate. To be crystal clear: as a film maker you will receive a warm welcome in Edinburgh. You are not censored or rejected. The opposition was to the Festival’s taking money from the Israeli state".<ref>Ahmad, Muhammad. [http://pulsemedia.org/2009/05/26/ken-loach-responds-to-critics/ Ken Loach responds to critics], pulsemedia.org, 26 May 2009.</ref> To his critics, he added later: "The boycott, as anyone who takes the trouble to investigate knows, is aimed at the Israeli state."<ref name="pulse2">Ahmad, Muhammad.

In June 2009, Loach, Paul Laverty (writer) and Rebecca O'Brien (producer) pulled their film ''Looking For Eric'' from the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]], where the Israeli Embassy is a sponsor, after the festival declined the withdraw their sponsorship.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/national/israeli-funding-angers-filmmaker-20090717-do9x.html Israeli funding angers filmmaker] by Philippa Hawker, ''The Age''. 18 July 2009.</ref> The festival's chief executive, Richard Moore, compared Loach's tactics to blackmail, stating that "we will not participate in a boycott against the State of Israel, just as we would not contemplate boycotting films from China or other nations involved in difficult long-standing historical disputes.” Australian lawmaker [[Michael Danby]] also criticised Loach’s tactics stating that “Israelis and Australians have always had a lot in common, including contempt for the irritating British penchant for claiming cultural superiority. Melbourne is a very different place to Londonistan.”<ref>[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/07/19/1006615/british-director-withdraws-festival-film British director withdraws festival film], Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), 19 July 2009.</ref>

Loach, Laverty and O'Brien subsequently wrote that: "We feel duty bound to take advice from those living at the sharp end inside the occupied territories. We would also encourage other filmmakers and actors invited to festivals to check for Israeli state backing before attending, and if so, to respect the boycott. Israeli filmmakers are not the target. State involvement is. In the grand scale of things it is a tiny contribution to a growing movement, but the example of South Africa should give us heart".<ref>[http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article10756.shtml Why we back the boycott call] by Ken Loach, Rebecca O'Brien and Paul Laverty, The Electronic Intifada, 7 September 2009.</ref>

Together with [[John Pilger]] and [[Jemima Khan]], Ken Loach was among the six people in court willing to offer [[surety]] for [[Julian Assange]] when he was arrested in London on 7 December 2010.<ref>Paul Owen, et al [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/07/julian-assange-refused-bail-over-rape-allegations "Julian Assange refused bail over rape allegations",]''The Guardian'', 7 December 2010</ref> In a recent interview with ShortList<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/article/1221/ken-loach-interview#image-rotator-2 |title=Ken Loach Interview - Entertainment - ShortList Magazine |publisher=Shortlist.com |date= |accessdate=13 April 2013}}</ref> magazine he said "It’s clear that he’s being set up. Clearly the Yanks want to get him back and either imprison him for a long time, or worse. We need a bit of solidarity with someone who has just told us things that we were entitled to know." The bail money was lost in June 2012 when a judge ordered it to be forfeited, as Assange had sought to escape the jurisdiction of the English courts by entering the London embassy of Ecuador.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2198072/Julian-Assanges-high-profile-backers-set-lose-340-000-bail-money-remains-holed-Ecuador-Embassy.html#ixzz25XOfdk4R Daily Mail 4 September 2012]</ref>

In November 2012, Ken Loach turned down the Turin Film Festival award, after learning that the National Museum of Cinema in Turin (Italy) has outsourced cleaning and security services.

==Criticism==
During the 1960s, Grace Wyndham Goldie, the BBC's head of Talks (i.e. non-fiction), complained that Loach appeared to be side-stepping the Corporation's normally stringent rules about political partisanship by using some documentary material in his fiction.<ref name="Controversies">[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1418438/ BFI Screenonline - Ken Loach: the controversies]</ref>

His films ''Hidden Agenda'' and ''The Wind That Shakes The Barley'' have been criticised as being too sympathetic to the [[Irish Republican Army]] and [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]].<ref name="Controversies"/>  Conservative MP [[Ivan Stanbrook]] referred to ''Hidden Agenda'' as "the IRA entry at Cannes".<ref name="Mail"/>  In the case of the latter film, Loach was criticised for taking public money from the UK Film Council to make a film that sided with the IRA against the UK.<ref name="Controversies"/>  The [[Daily Mail]] wrote an article entitled, "Why does Ken Loach loathe his country so much?".<ref name="Mail">{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Ruth Dudley |date=30 May 2006 |title=Why does Ken Loach loathe his country so much? |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-388256/Why-does-Ken-Loach-loathe-country-much.html |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=London |access-date=22 May 2015 }}</ref>

Loach was criticised for "bullying ghastliness" for his call for a boycott of the 2009 Edinburgh Film Festival if it showed a film by [[Tali Shalom-Ezer]], who had accepted £300 from the Israeli embassy for travel expenses.<ref name ="Massie"/>  An editorial in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' noted that Loach had not called for the same boycott of the [[Cannes Film Festival]], where his film was in competition with some Israeli films.

Radical feminist [[Julie Bindel]] has criticised Loach's films for a lack of female characters.<ref name="Bindel"/>  She wrote, "Loach is a man of the people, but only people with a penis", and argued that women rarely appear in Loach's films except for as love interests for the male characters.<ref name="Bindel"/>  She also wrote, "Loach appears not to know gay people exist".<ref name="Bindel">{{cite news |last=Bindel |first=Julie |date=2 June 2014 |title=Dick-swinging filmmakers like Ken Loach constantly write real women and our struggles out of history |url= http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/culturehousedaily/2014/06/dick-swinging-filmmakers-like-ken-loach-constantly-write-real-women-and-our-struggles-out-of-history/|newspaper=The Spectator |location=London |accessdate=26 October 2014 }}</ref>  However, his early work ''Poor Cow'' was praised for "unusual sensitivity to a woman's point of view".<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/movies/poor-cow/review/109421/ TV Guide - Poor Cow]</ref>

==Honours==
Loach turned down an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1977. In a ''[[Radio Times]]'' interview, published in March 2001, he said: {{quote|It's all the things I think are despicable: patronage, deferring to the monarchy and the name of the [[British Empire]], which is a monument of exploitation and conquest. I turned down the OBE because it's not a club you want to join when you look at the villains who've got it.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1217962.stm ''Director Loach slams TV news''], [[BBC News]], 13 March 2001, Retrieved 1 May 2012.</ref>}}
