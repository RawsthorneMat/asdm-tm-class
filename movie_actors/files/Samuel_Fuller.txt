==Personal life==
He was born Samuel Michael Fuller in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], the son of Benjamin Rabinovitch who died in 1923 when his son was 11. After immigrating to the United States, the family's surname was changed from Rabinovitch to Fuller, a name possibly inspired by a [[Samuel Fuller (Mayflower physician)|doctor]] who arrived in America on the ''[[Mayflower]]''.<ref>p.7 Fuller, Samuel. ''A Third Face''. Alfred A Knopf (2002)</ref>  Fuller tells in his autobiography, ''A Third Face'' (2002), that he did not speak until he was five. His first word was "Hammer!".<ref>http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fuller.htm</ref>

After his father's death the family moved to New York city where, at the age of 12, he began working in journalism as a newspaper copyboy. He became a crime reporter in New York City at age 17, working for the ''[[New York Graphic|New York Evening Graphic]].''  He broke the story of [[Jeanne Eagels]]' death.<ref>p.51 Fuller</ref> He wrote [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] novels, including ''The Dark Page'' (1944; reissued in 2007 with an introduction by [[Wim Wenders]]),<ref>http://lccn.loc.gov/44009240</ref> which was later adapted into the 1952 movie ''Scandal Sheet''.

Fuller wrote screenplays from the mid-1930s onwards. He also became a screenplay [[ghostwriter]] but always refused to tell interviewers which screenplays he wrote in that capacity.

During [[World War II]], Fuller joined the [[United States Army]]. He was assigned as an infantryman to the [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)|16th Infantry Regiment]], [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]], and saw heavy fighting. He was involved in landings in [[Operation Torch|Africa]], [[Operation Husky|Sicily]], and [[Omaha Beach|Normandy]] and also saw action in [[Belgium]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. In 1945 he was present at the liberation of a German concentration camp and shot 16&nbsp;mm footage that was used later in the documentary ''[[Falkenau: The Impossible.]]'' For his service he was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], the [[Silver Star]], and the [[Purple Heart]] and reached the rank of Corporal.<ref>[http://www.litweb.net/biography/398/Samuel_Fuller.html Biography] at Litweb.net</ref> Fuller used his wartime experiences as material in his films, especially in ''[[The Big Red One]]'' (1980), the nickname for the 1st Infantry Division. After the war Fuller co-authored a regimental history of the 16th Infantry.<ref>http://warchronicle.com/16th_infantry/historiantales_wwii/16th_Infantry_1798_1946/ChapterI.pdf?bcsi_scan_d20c301d7a026bb4=0&bcsi_scan_filename=ChapterI.pdf</ref>

After his controversial film ''[[White Dog]]'' was shelved by Paramount Pictures, Fuller moved to France and never directed another American film.<ref name="Chicago Tribune"/><ref name="Hoberman"/> Fuller eventually returned to America. He died of natural causes in his California home. In November 1997 the Directors Guild held a three-hour memorial in his honor, hosted by [[Curtis Hanson]], his longtime friend and co-writer on ''White Dog.'' He was survived by his wife Christa and daughter Samantha.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Celebrating Fuller to the Fullest, at Last |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Kevin |last=Thomas |date=November 24, 1997 |page=F1 }}</ref>

==Career==

===Writing and directing===
''[[Hats Off (1936 film)|Hats Off]]'' (1936) marked Fuller's first credit as a screenwriter.  He wrote many screenplays throughout his career, such as ''[[Gangs of the Waterfront]]'' in 1945.  He was unimpressed with [[Douglas Sirk]]'s direction of his ''[[Shockproof]]'' screenplay, and he made the jump to writer/director after being asked to write three films by independent producer [[Robert Lippert]]. Fuller agreed to write them if he would be allowed to direct them as well, with no extra fee. Lippert agreed. Fuller's first film under this arrangement was ''[[I Shot Jesse James]]'' (1949) followed by ''[[The Baron of Arizona]]'' with [[Vincent Price]].<ref>[http://www.criterion.com/boxsets/499 Eclipse Series 5:  The First Films of Samuel Fuller] from [[The Criterion Collection]] website</ref>

Fuller's third film, ''[[The Steel Helmet]]'', established him as a major force. The first film about the [[Korean War]] made during the war,<ref>The Men Who Made the Movies: Sam Fuller, Turner Classic Movies 2002</ref> he wrote it based on tales from returning Korean [[veteran]]s and his own [[World War II]] experiences. The film was attacked by reporter [[Victor Riesel]] for being, as Riesel saw it, "pro-Communist" and "anti-American." Critic Westford Pedravy alleged that Fuller was secretly financed by "the Reds."<ref>p.262 Fuller</ref> Fuller had a major argument with the U.S. Army, which provided [[stock footage]] for the film. When army officials objected to Fuller's American characters executing a [[prisoner of war]], Fuller replied he had seen it done during his own military service. A compromise was reached when the Lieutenant threatens the [[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]] with a [[court martial]].

After the success of ''The Steel Helmet'', Fuller was sought out by the [[major studio]]s. He asked each of them what they did with the profits from their films.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} All gave him advice on [[tax shelter]]s, except for [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] of [[20th Century-Fox]], who replied, "We make better movies," the answer Fuller was seeking. Zanuck signed Fuller for a contract for seven films, the first being another Korean War film, ''[[Fixed Bayonets!]]'', in order to head off other studio competition copying ''[[The Steel Helmet]]''. The U.S. Army assigned [[Medal of Honor]] recipient [[Raymond Harvey]] as Fuller's [[technical advisor]].

The proposed seventh film, ''Tigrero'', based on a book by [[Sasha Siemel]], is the subject of a 1994 documentary by [[Mika Kaurismäki]], ''[[Tigrero: A Film That Was Never Made]]'', that featured Fuller and [[Jim Jarmusch]] visiting the proposed Amazon locations of the film. Film Fuller shot on that location at the time was featured in his ''[[Shock Corridor]]''.

Fuller's favorite film was ''[[Park Row (film)|Park Row]]'', a story of American journalism.<ref name="Schick1998">{{cite book

Alfred A Knopf (2002)</ref> Instead, he started his own production company, with his profits to make the film on his own. ''Park Row'' was a labor of love and served as a tribute to the journalists he knew as a newsboy. His flourishes of style on a very low budget led critics such as Bill Krohn to compare the film to ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.

Fuller followed this with ''[[Pickup on South Street]]'' (1953), a [[film noir]] starring [[Richard Widmark]], which became one of his best-known films. Other films Fuller directed in the 1950s include ''[[House of Bamboo]]'', ''[[Forty Guns]]'' and ''[[China Gate (1957 film)|China Gate]]'', which led to protests from the French government and a friendship with writer [[Romain Gary]]. After leaving Fox, Fuller started his Globe Productions that made ''[[Run of the Arrow]]'', ''[[Verboten!]]'', and ''[[The Crimson Kimono]]'' and produced, wrote and directed a television pilot about World War II soldiers called ''Dogface'' that was not picked up.<ref>p.120 Dombrowski, Lisa ''The Films of Samuel Fuller: If You Die, I'll Kill You'' Wesleyan University Press, March 31, 2008</ref>

In 1961 Warner Bros. offered to finance his ''The Big Red One'' in return for his making ''[[Merrill's Marauders (film)|Merrill's Marauders]]''. When Fuller had had problems with Warners' editing of his film the ''Big Red One'' fell through.<ref>p. 142 Dobrowski</ref>

Fuller's films throughout the 1950s and early 1960s generally were lower-budget genre movies that explored controversial subjects. ''[[Shock Corridor]]'' (1963) is set in a [[psychiatric hospital]], while ''[[The Naked Kiss]]'' (1964) features a prostitute attempting to change her life by working in a [[pediatric]] ward. Both films were released by [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]].

Between 1967 and 1980, Fuller directed only one film, the Mexican-produced ''[[Shark! (film)|Shark]]'' (1969).  Fuller asked the Directors Guild to remove his name from the credits of ''Shark''. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} He returned in 1980 with the epic [[The Big Red One]], the semi-autobiographical story of a platoon of soldiers and their harrowing experiences during [[World War II]]. The film won critical praise but failed at the box office.

{{Quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right  | quote="Shelve the film without letting anyone see it? I was dumbfounded. It's difficult to express the hurt of having a finished film locked away in a vault, never to be screened for an audience.

Moving to France for a while would alleviate some of the pain and doubt that I had to live with because of White Dog."|source=&nbsp;—''White Dog: Sam Fuller Unmuzzled'', Samuel Fuller, as quoted by J. Hoberman, [[Criterion Collection]]<ref name="Hoberman"/>}}
In 1981, he was selected to direct the film ''[[White Dog]]'', based on a novel by [[Romain Gary]].<ref name="Chicago Tribune">{{Cite journal |title=Fuller's fable 'White Dog' has its day at last |first=Dave |last=Kehr |journal=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=November 29, 1991 |page=C |issn=1085-6706 }}</ref> The controversial film depicts the struggle of a black dog trainer trying to de-program a "white dog," a stray that was programmed to viciously attack any black person.

During filming, [[Paramount Pictures]] grew increasingly concerned that the film would offend African-American viewers and brought in two consultants to review the work and offer their approval on the way black characters were depicted.<ref name="Hoberman"/><ref name="Every Dog"/><ref name="New York Times">{{cite journal |title=White Dog 1982 |first=Charles |last=Taylor |journal=New York Times |location=New York City |date=November 2, 2008 |page=MT. 16 }}</ref> One felt the film had no racist connotations, while the other, Willis Edwards, vice president of the Hollywood [[NAACP]] chapter, felt the film was inflammatory and should never have been made.<ref name="Every Dog"/> The two men provided a write-up of their views for the studio executives, which were passed to producer [[Jon Davison]] along with warnings that the studio was afraid the film would be boycotted. Fuller was not told of these discussions nor given the notes until two weeks before filming was slated to conclude. Known for being a staunch [[integrationist]] and for his regularly giving black actors non-stereotypical roles, Fuller was furious, finding the studio's actions insulting. He reportedly had both representatives banned from the set afterwards, though he did integrate some of the suggested changes into the film.<ref name="Every Dog"/><ref name="New York Times"/> After the film's completion Paramount refused to release it, declaring that it didn't have enough earnings potential to go against the threatened NAACP boycotts and possible bad publicity.<ref name="Chicago Tribune"/><ref name="Hoberman"/><ref name="Every Dog"/><ref name="Chronicle of Higher Education">{{Cite journal |title=Sam the Man |first=Thomas |last=Doherty |date=August 8, 2008 |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education|The Chronicle Review]] |volume=54 |issue=48 |page=B11 |url=http://chronicle.com/weekly/v54/i48/48b01101.htm }}</ref>

After Fuller's move to France, he never directed another American film. He directed two theatrical French films, ''[[Thieves After Dark|Les Voleurs de la nuit]]'' in 1984 and ''[[Street of No Return]]'' in 1989. ''Les Voleurs de la nuit'' was entered into the [[34th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1984/02_programm_1984/02_Programm_1984.html |title=Berlinale: 1984 Programme |accessdate=January 4, 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> He directed his last film, ''[[The Madonna and the Dragon]]'', in 1990, and he wrote his last screenplay, ''[[Girls in Prison (1994 film)|Girls in Prison]]'', in 1994.

With his wife, [[Christa Lang]], and Jerry Rudes, Fuller wrote an autobiography ''A Third Face'' (published in 2002). This was the culmination of a long career as an author. Among his books are the novels ''Test Tube Baby'' (1936), ''Make Up and Kiss'' (1938) and ''The Dark Page'' (1944); [[novelization]]s of his films ''The Naked Kiss'' (1964) and ''The Big Red One'' (1980; reissued 2005); and ''144 Piccadilly'' (1971) and  ''Quint's World'' (1988). A book-length interview of Fuller by Jean Narboni and Noel Simsolo, ''Il etait une fois ... Samuel Fuller'' (with a preface by [[Martin Scorsese]]) appeared in 1986.

===Acting===
Fuller made a [[cameo role|cameo appearance]] in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Pierrot le Fou]]'' (1965), where he famously intones: ''Film is like a battleground... Love, hate, action, violence, death. In one word, emotion!''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brody|first=Richard|title=Everything is Cinema: The Working Life of Jean-LucGodard|publisher=Metropolitan Books|year=2008|pages=246|isbn=0-8050-6886-4}}</ref> He also made a [[cameo role|cameo appearance]] at an outdoor cafe in [[Luc Moullet]]'s [[Brigitte et Brigitte]] (1966) along with [[French New Wave]] directors [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Eric Rohmer]] and [[André Téchiné]].  He plays a film director in [[Dennis Hopper]]'s ill-fated ''[[The Last Movie]]'' (1971);<ref>[http://www.geraldpeary.com/interviews/def/fuller.html Cigars and Cinema with Sam Fuller], an interview from geraldpeary.com</ref> an Army colonel in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979); a war correspondent in his own ''The Big Red One'' (scene deleted in the original release, restored in the reconstructed version),<ref>''The Big Red One'' a film by Samuel Fuller</ref> a talent agent in his film ''[[White Dog]]'' (1981), and a cameraman in [[Wim Wenders]]' ''[[The State of Things (film)|The State of Things]]'' (1982). He portrays an American gangster in two films set in Germany: ''[[The American Friend]]'' by Wenders and ''[[Helsinki Napoli All Night Long]]'' by [[Mika Kaurismäki]]. He also appeared in [[Larry Cohen]]'s ''[[A Return to Salem's Lot]]'' (1987), and played a businessman in "[[La vie de bohème (film)|La vie de bohème]]" (1992) by [[Aki Kaurismäki]]. His last work in film was as an actor in ''[[The End of Violence]]'' (1997). A photo of Fuller also appears on one of the mirrors of a stripper in his ''Shock Corridor''.

===Style and theme===
Fuller's work has been described as primitive by Luc Moullet and by the influential American critics [[Manny Farber]] and [[Andrew Sarris]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dombrowski|first=Lisa|title=If You Die, I'll Kill You: the Films of Samuel Fuller|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year=2008|pages=8}}</ref> Grant Tracey has used the term "narrative tabloid" to refer to Fuller's style of filmmaking.<ref>[http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue01/features/fuller1.htm The Narrative Tabloid of Samuel Fuller] by Grant Tracey, from imagesjournal.com</ref> This was the result of his often lower budgets, but also reflected Fuller's pulp-inspired writing.

Fuller was known for using intense close-ups, off centered framings, and shock editing in many of his films, which were often about men facing death in combat. These scenes were both violent and tragic.<ref name="Chronicle of Higher Education" />
Fuller often featured [[Marginalization|marginalized]] characters in his films.  The [[protagonist]] of ''Pickup on South Street'' is a [[pickpocket]] who keeps his beer in the [[East River]] instead of a [[refrigerator]].  ''Shock Corridor'' concerns the patients of a [[mental hospital]]. ''[[Underworld U.S.A.]]'' (1961) focuses on an [[orphan]]ed victim of mobsters. The leading ladies of ''[[Pickup on South Street]]'', ''[[China Gate (1957 film)|China Gate]]'', and ''[[The Naked Kiss]]'' are prostitutes.  These characters sometimes find retribution for the injustices against them.  ''[[White Dog]]'' and ''[[The Crimson Kimono]]'' (1959) have definite [[anti-racist]] elements. ''[[The Steel Helmet]]'', set during the [[Korean War]], contains dialogue about the internment of [[Japanese-Americans]] and the segregation of the American military in [[World War II]], and features a racially mixed cast.

===Legacy===
Although Fuller's films were not considered great cinema in their times, they gained critical respect in the late 1960s. Fuller welcomed the new-found esteem, appearing in films of other directors and associating himself with younger filmmakers.

The [[French New Wave]] claimed Fuller as a major stylistic influence,<ref>[http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/bookreview.php?issue=13&id=1118 Scope Book Review] Michael Brian Faucette</ref> especially [[Luc Moullet]].<ref>Moullet, Luc. "Sam Fuller-sur les brisees de Marlowe" ''Cahiers du Cinema''93, March 1959</ref> His visual style and rhythm were seen as distinctly American, and praised for their energetic simplicity. [[Martin Scorsese]] praised Fuller's ability to capture action through camera movement.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In the 1996 documentary ''The Typewriter, the Rifle & the Movie Camera'' [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Jim Jarmusch]] credited Fuller as influential upon their works.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118004/</ref>

In the mid-1980s, Fuller was the first international director guest at the [[Midnight Sun Film Festival]].<ref>[http://www.msfilmfestival.fi/page.php?p=16 History of the Midnight Sun Film Festival]</ref> The festival's hometown, [[Sodankylä]], [[Finland]], named a street "Samuel Fullerin katu," Samuel Fuller's street.
