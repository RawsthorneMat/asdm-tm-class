'''Joseph "Joe" Dante, Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|t|eɪ}}; born November 28, 1946) is an American film director, producer, [[Film editor|editor]] and actor. His films—notably ''[[Gremlins]]'' (1984)—often mix fantastical storylines with comedic elements.

Dante's films include ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]'' (1978) and ''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling]]'' (1981) (both from scripts by [[John Sayles]]), ''[[Gremlins]]'' (1984) and its [[Gremlins 2: The New Batch|sequel]] (1990), ''[[Explorers (film)|Explorers]]'' (1985), ''[[Innerspace]]'' (1987),  ''[[The 'Burbs]]'' (1989), ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' (1993), ''[[Small Soldiers]]'' (1998), and ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' (2003). His work for television and cable includes immigration satire ''[[The Second Civil War]]'' (1997) and episodes of anthology series ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' (''[[Homecoming (Masters of Horror episode)|Homecoming]]'' and ''[[The Screwfly Solution (Masters of Horror episode)|The Screwfly Solution]]'') and ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', as well as ''[[Hawaii Five-0]]''.

==Early life and career==
Dante was born in [[Morristown, New Jersey]]. His father was a professional golf player, though Dante was more interested in becoming a cartoonist.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment/Joe-Dante-interview-Meet-a.5380530.jp?CommentPage=1&CommentPageLength=1000|title=Joe Dante interview: Meet a matinee idol|first=Alistair|last=Harkness|publisher=Scotsman.com|location=Edinburgh|date=June 18, 2009}}</ref> Dante began his film career working for legendary low budget producer [[Roger Corman]], who provided similar opportunities to future directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[James Cameron]]. He worked as an editor on films such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto (film)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' before co-directing ''[[Hollywood Boulevard (1976 film)|Hollywood Boulevard]]'' with [[Allan Arkush]].

His next feature film, Roger Corman-produced ''[[Piranha (1978 film)|Piranha]]'', was released in 1978. Inspired by [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', the film was written by [[John Sayles]]. Dante then invited Sayles to rewrite the script for werewolf tale ''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling]]'', loosely based on the novel by [[Gary Brandner]].

==Gremlins and beyond==

Dante directed episodes of cult television series ''[[Police Squad]]'', before Steven Spielberg invited him to join the directing team on anthology movie ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''. Dante's segment, 'It's a Good Life', featured cartoon-style special effects, and revolved around a woman (played by [[Kathleen Quinlan]]) who is 'adopted' by an omnipotent boy.

''[[Gremlins]]'' (1984) proved one of Dante's biggest hits to date. Combining horror and comedy elements, the film revolves around Billy ([[Zach Galligan]]), who is given a strange creature he calls Gizmo, as a pet. After Billy fails to follow the rules for looking after Gizmo, the creature spawns other creatures which transform into destructive monsters who then begin rampaging through the local town. Six years passed before Dante directed the even more anarchic ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'' (1990), set this time in a New York high rise.

Aside from the Gremlins films, Dante also worked with producer Steven Spielberg on comedy adventure ''[[Innerspace]]'' (1987), in which [[Dennis Quaid]]'s character is miniaturised and injected inside a human body. His 1985 boys meet alien tale ''[[Explorers (film)|Explorers]]'' marked the film debuts of actors [[River Phoenix]] and [[Ethan Hawke]]. Dante would later work with [[Tom Hanks]] on ''[[The 'Burbs]]'' (1989), a black comedy in which Hanks' character deals with nightmare neighbours.

==Projects after 1990==

In 1993 Dante directed ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'', which received positive reviews. Set during the 1960s, the film pays homage to B movies and the showmen who made and promoted them. ''Matinee'' has a 91 percent rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. In his review for the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote, "At the same time that Dante has a field day brutally satirizing our desire to scare ourselves and others, he also re-creates early-60s clichés with a relish and a feeling for detail that come very close to love". USA Today reviewer Mike Clark wrote "Part spoof, part nostalgia trip and part primer in exploitation-pic ballyhoo, Matinee is a sweetly resonant little movie-lovers' movie".

Dante was [[creative consultant]] on short-lived fantasy series ''[[Eerie, Indiana]]'' (1991–1992), and directed five episodes.  He played himself in the series finale. In 1995–1996 he worked on ''[[The Phantom (1996 film)|The Phantom]]''. When he was removed from the film, he chose screen credit (as executive producer) rather than pay.

In 2007, Dante launched the [[web series]] [[Trailers From Hell]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2007/12/joe-dante-presents-trailers-from-hell/|title=Joe Dante presents Trailers From Hell|publisher=Cinefantastique}}</ref> which provides commentary by directors, producers and screenwriters on trailers for classic and cult movies. He is also a contributor to the website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trailersfromhell.com/gurus/|title=Gurus: Joe Dante|publisher=Trailers from Hell}}</ref>

Dante's 2009 film "The Hole 3D"<ref>[http://movieset.com/thehole/ Video from the set of Joe Dante's "The Hole"]</ref> received positive reviews, and was awarded the Premio Persol at the 2009 Venice Film Festival. The new award was for the "3-D feature deemed the most creative among those produced globally between September 2008 and August 2009."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008567.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&nid=2562|title='Hole' wins Venice 3-D film prize: Dante horror pic nabs first ever Premio Persol|publisher=Variety | first=Nick|last=Vivarelli|date=September 14, 2009}}</ref>

With [[Roger Corman]] producing, Dante also directed the interactive [[web series]] ''Splatter'' for [[Netflix]]. The series stars [[Corey Feldman]] as a rock star seeking revenge on those he thinks have wronged him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34034/netflixs-splatter-launching-october-29th|title=Netflix's Splatter Launching on October 29th|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref>

In November 2011 it was announced that Dante would direct a thriller called "Air Disturbance" starring [[Robert Englund]] and [[Dylan Walsh]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=96720|title=Joe Dante to Direct Air Disturbance|publisher=Comingsoon}}</ref>

Various projects Dante is officially involved in are struggling with funding for years, among them the [[anthology film]] "Paris, I'll kill you", the werewolf feature "Monster Love", and the [[Roger Corman]] biopic "The Man with Kaleidoscope Eyes".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenread.de/joe-dante-interview-the-hole/|title=Interview: The Movie Orgies of Joe Dante|publisher=Screenread.de}}</ref>

Dante is currently making his next feature titled ''[[Burying the Ex]]'', a horror comedy about a young man who's controlling girlfriend suddenly dies in a freak accident but when he tries to move on with his life along with his new partner he discovers that his now undead Ex has comeback. The film will star Anton Yelchin and Ashley Greene. It has been selected to be screened out of competition at the [[71st Venice International Film Festival]].<ref name="Venice">{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/71st-festival/line-up/off-sel/out-of-competition/ |title=International competition of feature films |accessdate=10 August 2014 |work=Venice}}</ref><ref name="Deadline">{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/07/venice-film-festival-lineup-2014-movie-list/ |title=Venice Film Festival Lineup Announced |accessdate=10 August 2014 |work=Deadline}}</ref>

==Dante's actors==
Dante developed a [[Stock company (acting)|stock company]] of actors who worked with him over a long period of time. [[Dick Miller]], for example, has been in all of Dante's feature films and most of his television work, while [[Belinda Balaski]], [[Archie Hahn (actor)|Archie Hahn]], and [[Robert Picardo]] come in at close second, third, and fourth, with one less production each, respectively. Other names that Dante has worked with more than once include [[John Astin]], [[Paul Bartel]], [[Phoebe Cates]], producer Roger Corman, [[Cory Danziger]], [[Bruce Dern]], [[Rick Ducommun]], [[Kevin Dunn]], [[Corey Feldman]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Joe Flaherty]], [[Courtney Gains]], [[Zach Galligan]], [[Henry Gibson]], [[Charles S. Haas]], [[Heather Haase]], [[Phil Hartman]], [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]], [[Rance Howard]], late animator [[Chuck Jones]], [[Jackie Joseph]], [[Omri Katz]], [[Denis Leary]], [[Sarah Lilly]], [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]], [[Mark McCracken]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Don McCloud]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], [[Shawn C. Nelson]], [[Ron Perlman]], [[Jason Presson]], [[Kathleen Quinlan]], [[Neil Ross]], [[Diane Sainte-Marie]], [[John Sayles]], [[Wendy Schaal]], [[William Schallert]], [[Michael Scheehaan]], Dan Stanton, Don Stanton, [[Christopher Stone (actor)|Christopher Stone]], [[Meshach Taylor]], [[Kenneth Tobey]], [[Dee Wallace]], [[Mark Alan]] and [[Alexandra Wilson]].<ref>[http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Joe+Dante/ Suicide Girls interview]</ref>

Dante's long time friend and business associate, Sylvia, played one of the nuns at the concert in Allan Arkush's ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]''. Dante co-wrote and directed five scenes of the film when Arkush became ill.

==Dante's moviemaking==

Dante's films are well known for their many references to other movies and for their special effects.<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/11012/the_den_of_geek_interview_joe_dante.html Joe Dante talks about his career at Den of Geek]</ref> Dante's garage is frequently mentioned in audio commentaries as holding many of the props from his various films, including the Peltzer Peeler Juicer from ''Gremlins'', and where the mock-pornographic scene in ''The Howling'' was shot.

His respect for the screenwriter extends to the point where, in order to make sure Dante can confer with the writer on-set and provide some minor, additional [[remuneration]], he always casts the writer in a small part of the production itself. The studio is normally unwilling to pay to have the writer on-set in any other way.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/features/21-fearful-features/4250-a-career-spanning-conversation-with-joe-dante.html|title=A Career-Spanning Conversation with Joe Dante|publisher=Fangoria}}</ref>

Dante has cited among his major influences [[Roger Corman]], [[Chuck Jones]], [[Frank Tashlin]], [[James Whale]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], as well as an admiration for the film ''[[Hellzapoppin' (film)|Hellzapoppin']]'', from which he frequently borrows jokes because of how difficult the film is to see in the United States.<ref>[http://www.movieset.com/thehole/videos/rum7g9/The-Hole---3D---Behind-the-Scenes Interview with Joe Dante on set of The Hole 3D]</ref>
