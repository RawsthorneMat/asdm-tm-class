==Biography==

===Early life===
Karen Steele was born in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], to Percy Davis Steele, a Bostonian of English descent and a career Marine who in 1956 was named assistant administrator of the [[Marshall Islands]].

Her mother was the former Ruth Covey Merritt, a Californian of French and Danish heritage. Childhood in the Hawaiian Islands brought Steele into contact with the Japanese and Polynesian languages, as well as English.<ref name = GlamGirls>[http://www.glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com/show/257/Karen+Steele/index.html Karen Steele - The Private Life and Times of Karen Steele. Karen Steele Pictures<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

She attended the [[University of Hawaii]] and studied acting at [[Rollins College]] in [[Florida]] for a year. After that, she found work as a cover girl and model.

Steele earned her first money by spearing baby sharks {{why|date=May 2015}} in the private cove on the estate of Woolworth heiress [[Barbara Hutton]].<ref name = GlamGirls/>

===Career===

Steele's first acting job was in a radio play titled ''Let George Do It''. She subsequently appeared in the 1953 films ''The Clown'' (in an uncredited role) and ''Man Crazy'' (as Marge). The following year, she landed the role of Millie Darrow in "So False and So Fair" on the television anthology ''Studio 57''.

Her first critically acclaimed film was ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' (1955). She played Virginia and got the part because the director, [[Delbert Mann]], confused her with an actress from New York who he and writer [[Paddy Chayevsky]] had intended to play it.<ref name = GlamGirls/><ref>[http://www.tacky-times.com/magazine/volume_008/column_celeb.htm tacky-times.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

In 1958, she played the guest-star lead in the episode "Madame Faro" of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Jefferson Drum]]'', a [[Western (genre)|western]] series starring [[Jeff Richards (baseball player/actor)|Jeff Richards]].

Steele made two guest appearances on [[CBS]]'s ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', as Doris Stephanek in "The Case of the Haunted Husband" (1958) and as murder victim Carina Wileen in "The Case of the Fatal Fetish" (1965). She appeared as Mae Dailey in the 1961 episode "Big Time Blues" on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] drama, ''[[The Roaring 20s (TV series)|The Roaring 20s]]'', along with other guest stars [[Peter Breck]] and [[Shirley Knight]]. Earlier, she was cast in a guest-starring role in another ABC/WB series, ''[[The Alaskans]]'', starring [[Roger Moore]] and [[Dorothy Provine]].

In 1962, she portrayed the part of Dolly LeMoyne in the episode "The Woman Trap" on CBS's ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''.

Her character in "Survival of the Fattest", a 1965 episode of NBC's ''[[Get Smart]]'', was named Mary 'Jack' Armstrong, said to be "the strongest female enemy agent in the world".<ref>[http://allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=2:67823 allmovie ((( Karen Steele > Overview )))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is a reference to Jack Armstrong, the clean-cut fictional hero of ''[[Jack Armstrong the All American Boy]]'', an adventure series broadcast on radio from 1933 to 1951.

Like many [[actor|actresses]], as she got older, she turned to television commercials for income. She also became involved in charitable causes and community service. In early 1970, she went on a handshake tour of service hospitals in the South Pacific, rather than accept a series that would have paid her $78,000. As a result, she lost her agent.<ref name = GlamGirls/>

===Personal life===
In later life, she settled in [[Golden Valley, Arizona]], and married Dr. Maurice Boyd Ruland, a psychiatrist at the Mohave Mental Health Clinic. They were married until she died of cancer, aged 56, at the Kingman Regional Medical Center in [[Kingman, Arizona]].
