'''Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone''' (9 July 1925 – 10 October 1964), better known as '''Guru Dutt''', was an [[Cinema of India|Indian film]] [[Film director|director]], [[Film producer|producer]] and [[actor]]. He made 1950s and 1960s classics such as ''[[Pyaasa]]'', ''[[Kaagaz Ke Phool]]'' , ''[[Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam]]''  and ''[[Chaudhvin Ka Chand]]''. In particular, ''Pyaasa'' and ''Kaagaz Ke Phool'' are now included among the [[Films considered the greatest ever|greatest films of all time]], both by [[Time magazine's "All-TIME" 100 best movies]] <ref name=Time/> and by the ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' critics' and directors' poll,<ref name=Cinemacom/> where Dutt himself is included among the greatest film directors of all time.<ref name=Lee/> He is sometimes referred to as "India's [[Orson Welles]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=Was Guru Dutt India's Orson Welles?|author=Kavita Amarnani|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=14 March 2008|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2008/mar/14/wasguruduttindiasorsonwel|accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref>
In 2010, he was included among [[CNN]]'s "top 25 Asian actors of all time".<ref>http://www.hindustantimes.com/Big-B-in-CNN-s-top-25-Asian-actors-list/H1-Article1-515456.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.indianexpress.com/pictureStory.php?galId=768&pg=1&view=1</ref>

He is most famous for making lyrical and artistic films within the context of popular Hindi cinema of the 1950s, and expanding its commercial conventions, starting with his 1957 film, ''Pyaasa''. Several of his later works have a cult following. His movies go full house when re-released; especially in Germany, France and Japan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Asian Film Series No.9 GURU DUTT Retorospective|publisher=[[Japan Foundation]]|year=2001|url=http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/culture/new/old/0101/01_03.html|accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref>

==Early life and background==
Guru Dutt was born on 9 July 1925, in [[Bangalore]] to Shivashanker Rao Padukone and Vasanthi Padukone in a [[Konkani]] [[Chitrapur Saraswat Brahmin]] family.<ref>http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/sep/20dutt.htm</ref> His parents were originally settled at Panambur, [[Mangalore]] in South Kanara district (present day [[Dakshina Kannada]]) of Karnataka.<ref>Famous personalities from Tulunad {{URL|1 = http://portal.kinnigoli.com/forum/index.php?topic=714.0;wap2}}</ref> His father was initially a headmaster, and then a bank employee. His mother Vasanthi, while initially a housewife, later taught in a school, taught private classes and also wrote short stories and translated Bengali novels into Kannada. Vasanthi was 16 when Guru Dutt was born. His mother outlived him and died in 1994, 30 years after his death.{{cn|date=November 2014}}

Guru Dutt spent his early childhood in [[Bhowanipore]]<ref name=telegraph1>{{cite web|last=Nandgaonkar|first=Satish|title=The past master|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1041010/asp/look/story_3860229.asp|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref>  area of Calcutta (now [[Kolkata]]) and he grew close to Bengali culture and intellect. He even adopted the name Guru Dutt, Dutt (more commonly Datta or Dutta) being a common Bengali surname. He spoke fluent Bengali.<ref name="telegraph1"/> He was joined by three younger brothers, Atmaram, Devidas and Vijay and a younger sister, Lalitha. The Indian film director, [[Kalpana Lajmi]], is Lalitha's daughter.{{cn|date=November 2014}}

==Career==

===Early career===
Guru Dutt wired home to say he had got the job of a [[switchboard operator|telephone operator]] at a Lever Brothers factory in Kolkata. But soon he got disenchanted by the job and left it. He later joined his parents in [[Mumbai]] in 1944.

However, his uncle found him a job under a three-year contract with the [[Prabhat Film Company]] in [[Pune]] (then called Poona) in 1944. This once premier film producing centre had already seen the departure of its best talent, [[V. Shantaram]], who had by then launched his own production company called ''Kala Mandir''. It was at [[Prabhat Film Company]] that Guru Dutt met two people who would remain his good friends for life- actors [[Rehman (actor)|Rehman]] and [[Dev Anand]].

Guru Dutt acted in a small role as Sri Krishna in ''Chand'' in 1944. In 1945, he acted as well as assisted director [[Vishram Bedekar]] in ''Lakhrani'', and in 1946 he worked as an assistant director and choreographed dances for [[P. L. Santoshi]]’s film, '' Hum Ek Hain''.

This contract ended in 1947, but his mother got him a job as a freelance assistant with Baburao Pai, the CEO of the Prabhat Film Company and Studio. However, after that, for almost ten months, Guru Dutt was unemployed and stayed with his family at Matunga, [[Mumbai]].  
During this time, Guru Dutt developed a flair for writing in English, and wrote short stories for [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a local weekly English magazine.

It is during this time that is considered that he wrote the script for the "almost" autobiographical ''Pyaasa'' ({{lang-hi|the thirsty one}}). Its original name was ''Kashmakash'' ({{lang-hi|struggle}}), which was changed later to ''[[Pyaasa]]'' and was written at his home in [[Matunga]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

===As choreographer, actor, assistant director===
While Guru Dutt was hired by [[Prabhat Film Company]] as a choreographer, he was soon pressed into service as an actor, and even as an assistant director. At Prabhat, he met Dev Anand and Rehman, who both became stars. These early friendships helped ease his way into the film world.

After Prabhat failed in 1947, Dutt moved to [[Mumbai]], where he worked with two leading directors of the time, with [[Amiya Chakravarty (director)|Amiya Chakravarty]] in ''Girl's School'', and with [[Gyan Mukherjee]] in the [[Bombay Talkies]] film ''Sangram''. Then, Dev Anand offered him a job as a director in his new company, [[Navketan]], after the first movie had flopped.

Thus, Guru Dutt's first film, Navketan's ''[[Baazi (1951 film)|Baazi]]'', was released in 1951 . It was a tribute to the Forties' Film Noir Hollywood with the morally ambiguous hero, the transgressing siren, and shadow lighting.

===Dev Anand and Guru Dutt's promise===
There exists a very interesting anecdote behind this new job. Guru Dutt and Dev Anand used the services of the same laundry man when they were at Prabhat in Pune in 1945. One day Anand found that one of his shirts had been replaced with a different one. On arriving at work as the hero of ''Hum Ek Hain'', he found the film's young choreographer (Guru Dutt) wearing his shirt. On being questioned, Guru Dutt admitted that it was not his shirt, but since he had no other, he was wearing the replacement. This developed into a great friendship, since they were of the same age. They promised each other that, if Guru Dutt were to turn filmmaker, he would hire Anand as his hero, and if Dev were to produce a film then he would use Guru Dutt as its director.

Dev Anand fulfilled his end of the bargain with ''Baazi'', but regretted that his friend Guru Dutt did not. Guru Dutt indirectly did fulfill his promise. His studio, [[Guru Dutt Movies Pvt. Ltd.]], produced "[[C.I.D. (1956 film)|C.I.D.]]" which starred Dev, but the film was directed by [[Raj Khosla]] (an assistant director to Guru Dutt). Thus, technically, Guru Dutt never directed Dev Anand under his production company.

Guru Dutt and Dev Anand would make two super-hit films together, ''Baazi'', and ''Jaal''. Creative differences between Guru Dutt, and [[Chetan Anand (producer and director)|Chetan Anand]] (Anand's elder brother), who was also a director, made future collaborations difficult.

Remembering his old friend Guru Dutt, Anand quotes, “He was a young man he should not have made depressing pictures…”<ref>[http://dearcinema.com/interview/dev-anand-remembers-guru-dutt/1824 An interview of Dev Anand from www.dearcinema.com]</ref>

Recently, Anand quotes, "my only true friend in the film industry. We got close to each other while working for Prabhat, one of the big banners of those days. I gave him his big break in Baazi and he cast me in some of his movies like C.I.D."<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=3c5f9505-ab14-4a97-afd4-240feb7c723d&&Headline='One+should+live+the+moment...look+ahead' An article from Hindustan Times]</ref>

In 1978, Prabhat Chitra Mandal held a ceremony in Mumbai near Marine Lines station in honour of Guru Dutt on his birth anniversary which was attended by Guru Dutt's mother as well as Shri Dev Anand. Guru Dutt's mother told a touching story in her speech about their friendship. In his young age, Guru Dutt was about to commit suicide, it was Dev Anand who succeeded in preventing him. The mother said, thus the Guru Dutt you all know is not the son I gave birth to but one whose life Dev Anand saved.

===Baazi's other contributions===

''[[Baazi (1951 film)|Baazi]]'' also highlights two early key technical developments in Indian movie-making that are attributed to Guru Dutt. The use of close-up shots with a 100&nbsp;mm lens - there are over 14 in the movie - which became known in Indian movie-making as the "Guru Dutt shot", and the use of songs to further the narrative in the movie. Guru Dutt also introduced [[Zohra Sehgal]] (whom he met at Almora) as the choreographer in the movie, and he also met his future wife, [[Geeta Dutt]] during the making of the movie.

===As director===

[[Baazi (1951 film)|Baazi]] was an immediate success. Guru Dutt followed it with [[Jaal (1952 film)|Jaal]] and [[Baaz]]. Neither film did well at the box office, but they bring together the [[Guru Dutt team]] that performed so brilliantly in subsequent films. He discovered, and mentored, [[Johnny Walker (actor)|Johnny Walker]] (comedian), [[V.K. Murthy]] (cinematography), and [[Abrar Alvi]] (writing and directing), among others. He is also credited for introducing [[Waheeda Rehman]] to the Hindi cinema. [[Baaz]] was notable in that Guru Dutt both directed and starred, not having found a suitable actor for the principal character.

Fortune smiled on Dutt's next film, the 1954 [[Aar Paar]]. This was followed by the 1955 hit, [[Mr. and Mrs.55]], then  [[C.I.D. (1956 film)|C.I.D.]], [[Sailaab]], and in 1957, [[Pyaasa]] - the story of a poet, rejected by an uncaring world, who achieves success only after his apparent death. Guru Dutt played the lead role in three of these five films.

His 1959 [[Kaagaz Ke Phool]] was an intense disappointment. He had invested a great deal of love, money, and energy in this film, which was a self-absorbed tale of a famous director (played by Guru Dutt) who falls in love with an actress (played by Waheeda Rehman, Dutt's real-life love interest). [[Kaagaz Ke Phool]] failed at the box office and Dutt was devastated. All subsequent films from his studio were, thereafter, officially helmed by other directors since Guru Dutt felt that his name was anathema to box office.

[[Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam]], a critically and commercially successful film, was directed by his protégé, writer [[Abrar Alvi]], which won him the [[Filmfare]] Best Director's award.  The film's star [[Waheeda Rehman]] denied rumors that the film was ghost-directed by Guru Dutt himself.<ref>[http://in.rediff.com/movies/2004/oct/11guru.htm 'Nobody really knows what happened on October 10'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Guru Dutt also has his influence on his last box office smash hit [[Chaudhvin Ka Chand]].<ref>
the fact that [[Abrar Alvi]] was the strongest and most talented pillar that lead to guru dutt's success is sadly left unnoticed. since every hit movie requires a hit story ;it is crystal clear that mr.Alvi should be rewarded for Dutt's success.

His legacy to direction of Hindi cinema is unmistakable and accepted by many leading Hindi directors of the day, including another of his protégés, [[Raj Khosla]].

===Guru Dutt's last productions===

In 1964 he acted in his last film ''[[Sanjh Aur Savera]]'' directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee opposite Meena Kumari.

==Death==
On 10 October 1964, Guru Dutt was found dead in his bed in his rented apartment at [[Pedder Road]] in [[Mumbai]]. He is said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills. His death may have been suicide, or just an accidental overdose. It would have been his third suicide attempt.<ref>[http://in.rediff.com/movies/2004/oct/08spec1.htm]</ref>

Guru Dutt's son, Arun Dutt, said that he views this as an accident in an interview with ''India Abroad'' in October 2004 on the 40th anniversary of his father's death. Guru Dutt had scheduled appointments the next day with actress [[Mala Sinha]] for his movie ''[[Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi]]'', and [[Raj Kapoor]] to discuss making colour films. According to him, "my father had sleeping disorders and popped sleeping pills like any other person. That day he was drunk and had taken an overdose of pills, which culminated in his death. It was a lethal combination of excessive liquor and sleeping pills."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2004/oct/15dutt.htm |title='I miss my father terribly' |author=Ashraf, Syed Firdaus|date=15 October 2004 |work=Rediff.com |accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref>

At the time of his death, Guru Dutt was involved in two other projects - ''Picnic'' starring actress [[Sadhana (actress)|Sadhana]], and director [[K. Asif|K. Asif's]] epic, ''Love and God.''  ''Picnic'' remained incomplete and ''Love and God'' was released two decades later with [[Sanjeev Kumar (actor)|Sanjeev Kumar]] replacing Dutt in the leading role.

The extra-feature on DVD of ''[[Kaagaz Ke Phool]]'' has a three-part [[Channel 4]]-produced documentary on the life and works of Guru Dutt titled ''[[In Search of Guru Dutt]]''.

Most people, especially [[Abrar Alvi]], figured it was a suicide. Abrar and Dutt had many-a-times discussed ways of committing suicide and both had tried at least once but had failed.  Abrar and Guru Dutt sat late that night discussing a movie, and according to Alvi, during their conversation, Guru Dutt was very morbid in his thinking and conversation.<BR>He was, according to many, distressed by his personal situation - his wife, [[Geeta Dutt]], had distanced herself from him. He had a sleeping disorder that made him take sleeping pills, and he had been drinking since 5:00 pm that evening.

According to [[Asha Bhosle]], Guru Dutt called her at midnight before his death to ask whether his wife Geeta was with her to which she replied in the negative. She was the last person who spoke with Guru Dutt.

A Doordarshan documentary on Guru Dutt aired on 10 October 2011.

==Personal life==
In 1953, Dutt married [[Geeta Dutt]], a well-known playback singer. They had been engaged for three years and had to overcome a great deal of family opposition to marry. They had three children, Tarun, Arun, and Nina.

Dutt had an unhappy marital life. According to his brother Atmaram, Guru Dutt was "a strict disciplinarian as far as work was concerned, but totally undisciplined in his personal life" (Kabir, 1997, p.&nbsp;124). He smoked heavily, drank heavily, and kept odd hours. Guru Dutt's relationship with actress [[Waheeda Rehman]] also worked against their marriage. At the time of his death, he had separated from Geeta and was living alone. [[Geeta Dutt]] herself died in 1972 at age 41, after excessive drinking which resulted in liver damage. According to an interview with Abrar Alvi, one of Dutt's close friends and his assistant director in films, Dutt did not "open up" to discuss his thoughts and problems, even though they were spending many hours together.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Legacy==
Guru Dutt was at first mourned as a matinee idol but as the years passed, it became ever clearer that it was as a director that he would be remembered. Starting in 1973, his films were shown at film festivals throughout India and the rest of the world. Despite being a commercial director, he appealed to the same intelligentsia who made [[Satyajit Ray]] an international favorite. He also has a place in the hearts of many ordinary Indians for his song picturisations and the many vivid characters sketched in his films.

Contrary to a general belief about the viability of his film projects, Guru Dutt more or less produced commercially successful films.<ref>[http://www.boxofficeindia.com/cpages.php?pageName=top_hits Top hit bollywood movies from www.boxofficeindia.com]</ref> Over the years the commercial nature of his projects saw a trade-off with his creative aspirations. Movies like ''[[C.I.D. (1956 film)|C.I.D.]]'', ''[[Baazi (1951 film)|Baazi]]'', ''[[Pyaasa]]'', ''[[Kaagaz Ke Phool]]'', ''[[Chaudhvin Ka Chand]]'' and ''[[Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam]]'' were rightfully the first of their kind in Hindi cinema. The only movie produced by Guru Dutt and termed a box-office disaster was [[Kaagaz Ke Phool]], now a cult classic. He lost over 1.7&nbsp;million producing that film, a large amount by the standards of the time, which was more than recovered by his next project, [[Chaudhvin Ka Chand]]. He never lost faith in his team or in the distributors of his films. Once a project was over, he would begin anew - with little concern about the commercial success of the previous project. He was part of an exclusive school of Indian film directors, including the likes of [[Raj Kapoor]], [[Mehboob Khan]] and [[Bimal Roy]], who were able to achieve a healthy blend of artistic and commercial success between the mid-1950s and mid-1960s.

''[[Pyaasa]]'' was rated as one of the [[Time magazine's "All-TIME" 100 best movies|best 100 films]] of all time by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]''.<ref name=Time>"[http://www.time.com/time/2005/100movies/the_complete_list.html The Complete List]." All-Time 100 Movies ''[[Time Magazine]]''. 2005</ref> In the 2002 ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' critics' and directors' poll, two of his films, ''Pyaasa'' and ''[[Kaagaz Ke Phool]]'', were among the top 160 [[Films considered the greatest ever|greatest films of all time]].<ref name=Cinemacom>{{cite web|title=2002 Sight & Sound Top Films Survey of 253 International Critics & Film Directors|publisher=Cinemacom|year=2002|url=http://www.cinemacom.com/2002-sight-sound.html|accessdate=2009-04-19}}</ref> The same 2002 ''Sight & Sound'' poll ranked Dutt at #73 in its list of all-time greatest directors, thus making him the eighth highest-ranking [[Asian cinema|Asian filmmaker]] in the poll.<ref name=Lee>{{cite web|title=A Slanted Canon|author=Kevin Lee|publisher=Asian American Film Commentary|date=5 September 2002|url=http://www.asianamericanfilm.com/archives/000026.html|accessdate=2009-04-24}}</ref>
