===Legal troubles and controversy===
In February 2005, LaBeouf&nbsp;was arrested by police in Los Angeles and charged with assault with a deadly weapon after threatening his neighbor by driving into his car. A bystander claimed&nbsp;that LaBeouf&nbsp;lost his cool after he had to wait to get access to his garage while the neighbor, who was blocking his path, chatted to his girlfriend. The onlooker said: "Shia began honking his horn and yelling at the guy, but the neighbor told him to wait a minute, and carried on talking to his girlfriend. Then Shia rammed his car into the back of the other guy's car. Words were exchanged and Shia jumped out and threatened the neighbor." LaBeouf&nbsp;allegedly appeared at his neighbor's front door hours later waving a kitchen knife. The two fought, the cops were called, and the actor was led off in handcuffs.<ref>[http://www.hollywood.com/news/brief/2435433/shia-labeouf-caught-up-in-knife-attack-shocker?page=all Legal trouble], hollywood.com; accessed February 10, 2014.</ref>

In the early morning of February 5, 2011, he was involved in an altercation with another patron at the Mad Bull's Tavern bar in the [[Sherman Oaks]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, which resulted in the actor getting punched in the face.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shia-labeouf-handcuffed-released-bar-96959|title=Shia LaBeouf Handcuffed, Released After Bar Brawl|first=Charlie|last=Amter|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=February 5, 2011|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}</ref> Both LaBeouf and the unnamed patron were placed in handcuffs and questioned by a [[Los Angeles Police Department]] officer but later released with no arrest being made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/02/05/shia-labeouf-cuffed-bar-fight-los-angeles-sherman-oaks-punched|title=Shia LaBeouf Cuffed After Bar Fight|work=[[TMZ.com]]|publisher=Time Warner Inc|date=February 5, 2011|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}</ref>

On June 26, 2014, LaBeouf was charged with disorderly conduct and criminal trespass at New York's [[Studio 54]] theater. He was reported to have been "acting disorderly, yelling and being loud". He refused to leave the theater, where the musical ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' starring [[Alan Cumming]] was being performed, so the police were called. In the arrest report it was stated that LaBeouf spat at arresting officers.

In November 2014, LaBeouf stated that a woman "stripped [his] clothing and proceeded to rape [him]" the previous February at his Los Angeles art installation ''#IAMSORRY''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=How one Dazed journalist became Shia LaBeouf's pen-pal – and stared deep into the eyes of the metamodernist movie star

When later asked whether they regretted not having a code of conduct for participants during the exhibit, Turner said, "I don’t think you need a notice on the wall saying 'Do not murder the artist'."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Batty|first1=David|title=Shia LaBeouf collaborator: I don’t think you need a sign saying ‘Don’t murder the artist’|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/06/shia-labeouf-art-show-collaborators-first-interview|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=11 December 2014|date=6 December 2014}}</ref>

===Plagiarism accusations===
On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf released his short film ''[[Howard Cantour.com]]'' to the Internet and shortly after several bloggers noted its close similarity to ''Justin M. Damiano'', a 2007 comic by ''[[Ghost World]]'' creator [[Dan Clowes]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|title=Shia LaBeouf apologizes for 'copying' film idea|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/12/16/shia-labeouf-short-film-pulled/4046819|publisher=USA Today|date=December 16, 2013|accessdate=January 4, 2014|first1=Trey|last1=Barrineau}}</ref> ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' journalist Graeme McMillan noted at least three similarities in their article, one of which was that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical.<ref>{{cite news|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|title=Shia LaBeouf Accused of Plagiarizing Cartoonist in Short Film|url=http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/12/shia-labeouf-dan-clowes-comic|publisher=Wired|accessdate=January 3, 2014|date=December 16, 2013}}</ref> LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead "inspired" by him and "got lost in the creative process."<ref name=usatoday/> He followed this up with several apologies via [[Twitter]] writing, "In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that I have a great respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying "The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind."<ref>{{cite web|title=Shia LaBeouf Apologizes After Plagiarizing Artist Daniel Clowes For His New Short Film|url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/jordanzakarin/shia-labeouf-rip-off-daniel-clowes-howard-cantour?bftw|publisher=BuzzFeed|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref> LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on [[Yahoo! Answers]].<ref name=avclub>{{cite news|last=O'Neal|first=Sean|title=Shia LaBeouf plagiarizes Daniel Clowes comic for his film, responds with plagiarized apology|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/shia-labeouf-plagiarizes-daniel-clowes-comic-for-h-106565|accessdate=December 18, 2013|newspaper=A.V. Club|date=December 17, 2013}}</ref> 
 
Since the initial discovery of the plagiarism of Clowe's work, LaBeouf's other work has come under scrutiny. News outlets reported that LaBeouf's comic books, ''Let's Fucking Party'' and ''Stale N Mate'', had been plagiarized from [[Benoît Duteurtre]]'s ''The Little Girl and the Cigarette'' and [[Charles Bukowski]]'s ''Assault''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shia LaBeouf Appears to Have Also Plagiarized Passages by Bukowski and Other Authors|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/18/shia-labeouf-appears-to-have-also-plagiarized-passages-by-bukowski-and-other-authors|publisher=IGN|date=December 18, 2013|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Shia LaBeouf Seemingly Copied Bukowski, Others For His Own Comic Books|url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/jordanzakarin/shia-labeouf-copied-charles-bukowski-others-comic-books|publisher=BuzzFeed|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref>

In January 2014, LaBeouf spoke about the plagiarism accusations with ''[[Bleeding Cool]]'' writer [[Rich Johnston]], where he stated that he saw copyright laws as too restrictive and that it did not allow for ideas to flow freely.<ref name=BC>{{cite web|title="Authorship Is Censorship" – Bleeding Cool In Conversation With Shia LaBeouf|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/01/02/authorship-is-censorship-bleeding-cool-in-conversation-with-shia-labeouf|publisher=Bleeding Cool|date=January 2, 2014|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref> LaBeouf later tweeted a description of his next project, ''Daniel Boring'' (a reference to ''[[David Boring]]'', another comic created by Clowes). The description of the project was also taken word-for-word from a description by Clowes of his comic. Clowes' attorney, Michael Kump, has since sent a cease-and-desist letter to LaBeouf's attorney, which LaBeouf posted on Twitter.<ref>[http://www.thewrap.com/shia-labeouf-hit-cease-desist-letter-allegedly-plagiarizing-daniel-clowes], thewrap.com; accessed February 11, 2014.</ref>

===Religion===
In 2004, LaBeouf contributed an essay to the book ''I Am Jewish'', by [[Judea Pearl]], in which LaBeouf stated that he has a "personal relationship with God that happens to work within the confines of Judaism".<ref name="interfaith">{{cite news|last=Bloom|first=Nate|title=Interfaith Celebrities: Shia the Mensch|publisher=Interfaithfamily.com|date=April 10, 2007|url=http://www.interfaithfamily.com/arts_and_entertainment/popular_culture/Interfaith_Celebrities_Shia_the_Mensch.shtml?rd=2|accessdate=April 13, 2007}}</ref> He has described himself as Jewish,<ref name="indiel"/> but declared in 2007 that religion had "never made sense" to him.<ref name="refjuly07"/>  However, in an interview published in ''[[Interview Magazine]]'' in October 2014, LaBeouf stated "I found God doing ''Fury''. I became a Christian man, and not in a fucking bullshit way{{spaced ndash}}in a very real way. I could have just said the prayers that were on the page. But it was a real thing that really saved me".<ref name=IntvwMag>{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Elvis|title=Shia LaBeouf|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/shia-labeouf/|publisher=[[Interview Magazine]]|accessdate=October 21, 2014|date=October 20, 2014}}</ref>
