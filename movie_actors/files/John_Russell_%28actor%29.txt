==Background==

Born in [[Los Angeles, California]], he fit the [[Hollywood]] image of tall, dark, and handsome. He attended the [[UCLA|University of California]] as a student athlete. Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], he joined the [[United States Marines]], though he was initially rejected because of his height ({{height|ft=6|in=3}}).<ref>[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/reviews/showpdf.php?id=3562 Hollywood Stars and Their Service in the Marine Corps]</ref>  He was commissioned as second lieutenant on November 11, 1942, and was assigned to the [[6th Marines|6th Marine Regiment]]. His division was sent to [[Guadalcanal]], where he served as an assistant [[intelligence officer]]. He contracted [[malaria]] and returned home with a medical discharge.<ref>p.180 Wise, James E. & Rehill, Anne Collier ''Stars in the Corps: Movie Actors in the United States Marines'' 1999 Naval Institute Press</ref>

==Acting career==

Russell's first film appearance was in Frank Capra's ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939) as Otis Hopper. Russell was contracted to [[20th Century Fox]] in several supporting roles and later was signed with [[Republic Pictures]].  He primarily played secondary roles, often in [[western film]]s, including [[William A Wellman]]'s 1948 ''[[Yellow Sky]]'', but in 1952 starred opposite [[Judy Canova]] in ''[[Oklahoma Annie]]''.

In 1955, Russell was given the lead role in a television drama called  ''[[Soldiers of Fortune (TV)|Soldiers of Fortune]]''. The half-hour adventure show placed him and his sidekick, played by [[Chick Chandler]], in a dangerous jungle setting. While the show proved popular with young boys, it did not draw enough adult viewers to its prime slot and was canceled in 1957.

In 1957, Russell made a memorable appearance as a tough lawman in ''[[Untamed Youth]]''. 

In 1958, Russell portrayed Matt Reardon, a gunslinger befriended by Cheyenne Bodie in "The Empty Gun" of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] western series, ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'', starring [[Clint Walker]] in the title role. In the story line, Reardon tries to make amends to Martha Fullerton ([[Audrey Totter]]), the widow of the first man that he killed in a gunfight. Standing between them is her vengeful son, Mike ([[Sean Garrison]]), who calls out Reardon for a final gunfight. [[Tod Griffin]] plays Sheriff Frank Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0540161/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_43|title=The Empty Gun: Cheyenne|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=September 3, 2014}}</ref>

Russell appeared in other motion pictures for Warner Brothers, notably as a [[Sioux]] chieftain in ''[[Yellowstone Kelly]]'' with other Warner Brothers Television contract stars as well as the [[Howard Hawks]] 1959 western, ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'', which starred [[John Wayne]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Ricky Nelson]], and [[Walter Brennan]].

Throughout the 1960s to the 1980s, he returned to secondary roles, appearing in more than twenty films, including three directed by his friend [[Clint Eastwood]].  One of these was as Marshal Stockburn, the chief villain in Eastwood's 1985 film ''[[Pale Rider]]''.

Russell appeared in the second season of the [[Filmation]] children's science fiction series ''[[Jason of Star Command]]''. He played the role of Commander Stone, a blue-skinned alien from Alpha Centauri. He replaced [[James Doohan]], who played the Commander in the previous season but left to start working on ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''.
