==Early life==
Born and raised in [[White Plains, New York]], Duryea graduated from [[White Plains Senior High School|White Plains High School]] in 1924 and [[Cornell University]] in 1928. While at Cornell, Duryea was elected into the prestigious [[Sphinx Head Society]], Cornell's oldest senior honor society. He majored in English with a strong interest in drama, and in his senior year succeeded [[Franchot Tone]] as president of the college drama society.<ref name="Obit"/>

As his parents did not approve of his choice to pursue an acting career, Duryea became an advertising executive but after six stress-filled years, had a heart attack that sidelined him for a year.<ref name="Obit"/>

==Acting career==

===Film===
Returning to his earlier love of acting and the stage, Duryea made his name on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the play ''[[Dead End (1937 film)|Dead End]]'', followed by ''[[The Little Foxes]]'', in which he portrayed Leo Hubbard.<ref>[http://www.reelz.com/person/199229/dan-duryea/ "Dan Duryea."]  ''ReelZ TV about Movies'', 2013.

As the 1940s progressed, he found his niche as the "sniveling, deliberately taunting" antagonist in a number of [[film noir]] subjects: (''[[Scarlet Street]]'', ''[[The Woman in the Window]]'', ''[[Criss Cross (1949 movie)|Criss Cross]]'', ''[[Too Late for Tears]]'') and [[western (genre)|westerns]] such as ''Ride Clear of Diablo'', although he was sometimes cast in more sympathetic roles (''[[Black Angel]]'', ''[[One Way Street]]'').<ref name="Maltin p. 252"/> In 1946, exhibitors voted him the eighth most promising "star of tomorrow".<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17994035 "The Stars of To-morrow."] ''Sydney Morning Herald'' , September 10, 1946, p. 17. Retrieved: April 24, 2012.</ref>

When interviewed by [[Hedda Hopper]] in the early 1950s, Duryea spoke of career goals and his preparation for roles:
<blockquote>Well, first of all, let's set the stage or goal I set for myself when I decided to become an actor ... not just 'an actor', but a successful one. I looked in the mirror and knew with my "puss" and 155-pound weakling body, I couldn't pass for a leading man, and I had to be different. And I sure had to be courageous, so I chose to be the meanest s.o.b. in the movies ... strictly against my mild nature, as I'm an ordinary, peace-loving husband and father. Inasmuch, as I admired fine actors like Richard Widmark, Victor Mature, Robert Mitchum, and others who had made their early marks in the dark, sordid, and guilt-ridden world of [[film noir]]; here, indeed, was a market for my talents. I thought the meaner I presented myself, the tougher I was with women, slapping them around in well produced films where evil and death seem to lurk in every nightmare alley and behind every venetian blind in every seedy apartment, I could find a market for my screen characters.... At first it was very hard as I am a very even-tempered guy, but I used my past life experiences to motivate me as I thought about some of the people I hated in my early as well as later life ... like the school bully who used to try and beat the hell out of me at least once a week ... a sadistic family doctor that believed feeling pain when he treated you was the birthright of every man inasmuch as women suffered giving birth ... little incidents with trade-people who enjoyed acting superior because they owned their business, overcharging you. Then the one I used when I had to slap a woman around was easy! I was slapping the over-bearing teacher who would fail you in their 'holier-than-thou' class and enjoy it! And especially the experiences I had dealing with the unbelievable pompous 'know-it-all-experts' that I dealt with during my advertising agency days ... almost going 'nuts' trying to please these 'corporate heads' until I finally got out of that racket!"<ref name="IMDB">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002053/bio "Dan Duryea Biography."] ''[[Internet Movie Data Base|IMDb]].''

In his last years, Duryea worked in overseas film productions including the Italian Western ''[[The Hills Run Red (1966 film)|The Hills Run Red]]'' (1966) and the spy thriller ''[[Five Golden Dragons]]'' (1967) in West Germany while continuing to find roles on American television. He also appeared twice on the big screen with his son, character actor Peter Duryea, in the low-budget Westerns ''[[Taggart]]'' (1964) and ''The Bounty Killer'' (1965).<ref name="TCM"/>
