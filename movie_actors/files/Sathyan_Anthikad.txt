'''Sathyan Anthikad''' is an Indian film director, screenwriter, and lyricist best known for his family based [[Malayalam film]]s. 

Sathyan has created many critical and commercially successful films, especially when working with [[Sreenivasan (actor)|Sreenivasan]] as the scriptwriter. His popular films include ''[[T. P. Balagopalan M.A.]]'' (1986),  ''[[Gandhinagar 2nd Street]]'' (1986), ''[[Nadodikkattu]]'' (1987), ''[[Varavelpu]]'' (1989), ''[[Mazhavilkavadi]]'' (1989), ''[[Sasneham]]'' (1990), ''[[Sandesam]]'' (1991), ''[[Santhanagopalam]]'' (1994), ''[[Thooval Kottaram]]'' (1996), ''[[Veendum Chila Veettukaryangal]]'' (1999), ''[[Kochu Kochu Santhoshangal]]'' (2000), ''[[Manassinakkare]]'' (2003), and ''[[Rasathanthram|Rasatanthram]]'' (2006). Actors [[Mohanlal]] and [[Jayaram]] embodied the typical Sathyan Anthikkad protagonist in most of the films. On the other hand, Sathyan Anthikad had tried making movies in different genres as well but because of their lower success rate at the box-office he hasn't pursued to make more of them. Some of his such films include ''[[Pappan Priyappetta Pappan]]'' (1986), ''[[Artham]]'' (1989), and ''[[Pingami]]'' (1994).<ref>http://www.mathrubhumi.com/movies/interview/294250/</ref>

==Personal life==
Satyan  was born to M.V. Krishnan and M.K. Kalyani at [[Anthikad]] in [[Thrissur]] district of [[Kerala]],.<ref>http://www.mathrubhumi.com/movies/interview/101486/</ref> He is married to Nimmi Sathyan and has three sons.<ref>http://www.mangalam.com/print-edition/sunday-mangalam/2530</ref>

==Career==
In 1973, Sathyan debuted as an assistant director to [[Dr. Balakrishnan]] in Rekha Cine Arts.He was the Associate Director Of director [[P. Chandrakumar]] for more than twenty films till 1982.He also assisted director [[Jeassy]] in few films. Sathyan kickstarted his film direction with ''Kurukkante Kalyanam'' in 1982.<ref name="Weblokam profile">[http://www.weblokam.com/cinema/profiles/0611/02/1061102041_2.htm Weblokam profile]</ref> The legend has it that he started shooting his first film in 1981, named Chamayam.<ref>http://en.msidb.org/m.php?4</ref> Due to some unfortunate series of events this movie was never completed. He teamed up with [[Sreenivasan (actor)|Sreenivasan]] and made some of the most memorable films in [[Malayalam film]] history, with Sreenivasan as the screenwriter. ''[[Thalayanamanthram]]'', ''[[Nadodikkattu]]'' and ''[[Sandesam]]'' are some of the films born from this team, covering socially relevant matters with a comic touch. Sathyan made two novels into films: ''Appunni'' starring [[Mohanlal]] (a film adaptation of [[V. K. N.]]'s novel) and ''Irattakkuttikalude Achan'' starring [[Jayaram]] and [[Manju Warrier]] (an adaptation of C. V. Balakrishnan's novel).<ref name="weblokam.com">[http://www.weblokam.com/cinema/profiles/0611/02/1061102041_4.htm Weblokam profile]</ref> Of late, he has ventured into screenwriting and made films like ''[[Rasathanthram]]'', ''[[Vinodayathra]]'', ''[[Innathe Chintha Vishayam]]'' and ''[[Bhagyadevatha]]'', with credits of [[narrative|story]], [[dialogues]] and screenplay.

He is a favourite of family filmgoers because of his selection of plots in family-life backgrounds with social relevance and because of his comedic tastes.<ref name="Weblokam profile"/>

==Recurring collaborators==
Sathyan Anthikad often includes certain actors and technicians more than once in his films. [[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]] holds the record of working in maximum films with Sathyan Anthikad. He rarely makes movies without Innocent in the cast. [[Oduvil Unnikrishnan]], [[Mamukkoya]], [[Nedumudi Venu]] and [[K. P. A. C. Lalitha]] are common cast in his films. His association with screenwriter and actor [[Sreenivasan (actor)|Sreenivasan]]'s is one of the most successful combinations in Malayalam cinema. Among the lead actors, he has worked with [[Mohanlal]] the most, closely followed by [[Jayaram]]. The trio of Sathyan, [[Mohanlal]] and [[Sreenivasan (actor)|Sreenivasan]] have produced some of the most memorable hits in Malayalam cinema.

Either Vipin Mohan or [[Venu (cinematographer)|Venu]] has served as cinematographer for almost all of Anthikkad's films. [[Johnson (composer)|Johnson]] has provided music for most all his films till ''[[Veendum Chila Veettukaryangal]]''. Their combination is said to be one of the most successful in Malayalam film history. Many memorable songs and film scores of nineties emerged from this combo. In ''[[Kochu Kochu Santhoshangal]]'', Anthikkad roped in one of his favourite composers [[Ilaiyaraaja]] to compose music. However, he returned to [[Johnson (composer)|Johnson]] himself for his next films ''[[Narendran Makan Jayakanthan Vaka]]'' and ''[[Yathrakarude Sradhakku]]''. He again brought back Ilaiyaraja in ''[[Manassinakkare]]'', as [[Johnson (composer)|Johnson]] took a sabattical from film scoring.
