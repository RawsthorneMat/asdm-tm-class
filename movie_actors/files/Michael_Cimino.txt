==Origins==
Michael Cimino was born in New York City on February 3, 1939.<ref name=Heard-26>Heard, p. 26.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Cimino has given various dates for his birth, but his real birthdate is most likely February 3, 1939. In reference to Cimino's interview with Leticia Kent on December 10th 1978, Bach said, "Cimino wasn't thirty-five but a few months shy of forty."<ref name=Bach-170/>|group=a}} A third-generation Italian-American,<ref name=Andrews-249>Andrews, p. 249.</ref><ref>Lawton, Ben (2001). "America Through Italian/American Eyes: Dream or Nightmare?". ''From the Margins: Writing in Italian Americana''. Purdue University. [Cimino is said to be Italian/American]</ref> Cimino grew up in [[Old Westbury]], Long Island.<ref name=Bliss-268>Bliss, p. 268</ref> He was regarded as a prodigy at the private schools his parents sent him to, but rebelled against his parents by consorting with delinquents, getting into fights and coming home drunk.<ref name=Typhoon>Griffin, Nancy (February 10, 2002). "Last Typhoon Cimino Is Back". ''[[The New York Observer]]'' '''16''' (6): pp. 1+15+17.</ref> Of this time, Cimino described himself as "always hanging around with kids my parents didn't approve of. Those guys were so alive. When I was fifteen I spent three weeks driving all over Brooklyn with a guy who was following his girlfriend. He was convinced she was cheating on him, and he had a gun, he was going to kill her. There was such passion and intensity about their lives. When the rich kids got together, the most we ever did was cross against a red light."<ref name=Wakeman>Wakeman, John (1988). ''World Film Directors'' (2). The H. W. Wilson Company. pp.&nbsp;214–219.</ref>

His father was a music publisher.<ref name=Typhoon/> Cimino says his father was responsible for marching bands and organs playing pop music at football games.<ref name=Cimino-VF/> "When my father found out I went into the movie business, he didn't talk to me for a year," Cimino said.<ref name=Typhoon/> "He was very tall and thin&nbsp;... His weight never changed his whole life and he didn't have a gray hair on his head. He was a bit like a [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilt]] or a [[Whitney family|Whitney]], one of those guys. He was the life of the party, women loved him, a real womanizer. He smoked like a fiend. He loved his martinis. He died really young. He was away a lot, but he was fun. I was just a tiny kid."<ref name=Cimino-VF/> His mother, a costume designer,<ref name=Cimino-VF/> once told him after ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' that she knew he was famous because his name was in the ''[[New York Times]]'' crossword puzzle.<ref name=Typhoon/>

His nephew is novelist and screenwriter T. Rafael Cimino.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2576176/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1</ref>

===Education===
Cimino graduated from Westbury High School on Long Island in 1956. After graduating, he entered [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan]]. At Michigan State, Cimino majored in graphic arts, was a member of a weight-lifting club and a group that welcomed incoming students. He graduated in only three years with honors and won the Harry Suffrin Advertising Award. He was described in the 1959 ''Red Cedar Log'' yearbook as having tastes that included blondes, [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Chico Hamilton]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and "drinking, preferably vodka".<ref name=Bach-171>Bach, p. 171</ref>

In Cimino's final year at Michigan State, he became art director, and later managing editor, of the school's humor magazine ''Spartan''. [[Steven Bach]] wrote of Cimino's early magazine work: "It is here that one can see what are perhaps the first public manifestations of the Cimino visual sensibility, and they are impressive. He thoroughly restyled the ''Spartan''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s derivative ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' look, designing a number of its strikingly handsome covers himself. The Cimino-designed covers are bold and strong, with a sure sense of space and design. They compare favorably to professional work honored in, say, any of the ''Modern Publicity'' annuals of the late fifties and are far better than the routine work turned out on [[Madison Avenue]]. The impact and quality of his work no doubt contributed to his winning the Harry Suffrin Advertising Award at MSU and perhaps to his acceptance at Yale."<ref name=Bach-171/>

At Yale, Cimino continued to study painting as well as architecture and art history and became involved in school dramatics.<ref name=Katz/> In 1962, while still at Yale, he enlisted in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]].<ref name=Bach-170/><ref name=Bliss-268/> He trained for five months at [[Fort Dix]], New Jersey and had a month of medical training in [[Fort Sam Houston]], Texas.<ref name=Bach-170/><ref name=Typhoon/> Cimino graduated from [[Yale University]], receiving his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] in 1961 and his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in 1963, both in painting.<ref name=Bach-170>Bach, p. 170</ref><ref name=Typhoon/><!-- According to the Nigel Andrews quick bio, Cimino returned to New York where he studied acting and ballet and also attended the Directors' Unit of the Actors' Studio. There are scattered mentionings of this in other interviews. Bach wrote: "Yale appears to have loomed with unusual prominence in his creative development, for he spoke often of a burgeoning interest in the creative arts awakened there, in acting, and even in ballet."<ref name=Bach-171/> Find all details and get it nailed down! -->

}}
After graduating from Yale, Cimino moved to Manhattan to work in [[Madison Avenue]] advertising and became a star director of television commercials.<ref name=Typhoon/><ref name=Hickenlooper-76/> He shot ads for [[L'eggs]] hosiery, [[Kool (cigarette)|Kool cigarettes]], [[Eastman Kodak]], [[United Airlines]], and [[Pepsi]], among others.<ref name=Typhoon/><ref name=Final-Cut/> "I met some people who were doing fashion stuff-commercials and stills. And there were all these incredibly beautiful girls," Cimino said. "And then, zoom-the next thing I know, overnight, I was directing commercials."<ref name=Typhoon/> For example, Cimino directed the 1967 United Airlines commercial "Take Me Along", a musical extravaganza in which a group of ladies sing ''[[Take Me Along]]'' (adapted from a short-lived Broadway musical) to a group of men, presumably their husbands, to take them on a flight. The commercial is filled with dynamic visuals, American symbolism and elaborate set design that would become Cimino's trademark. "The clients of the agencies liked Cimino," remarked Charles Okun, Cimino's production manager from 1964 to 1978. "His visuals were fabulous, but the amount of time it took was just astronomical. Because he was so meticulous and took so long. Nothing was easy with Michael."<ref name=Final-Cut>Epstein, Michael (director). (2004). ''Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate''. [Television Production]. Viewfinder Productions.</ref> It was through his commercial work that Cimino met Joann Carelli, then a commercial director representative, beginning a 30-year on-again-off-again relationship.<ref name=Typhoon/>

===Screenwriting===
In 1971, Cimino moved to Los Angeles to start a career as a screenwriter.<ref name=Wakeman/> According to Cimino, it was Carelli that got him into screenwriting: "[Joann] actually talked me into it. I'd never really written anything ever before. I still don't regard myself as a writer. I've probably written thirteen to fourteen screenplays by [1978] and I still don't think of myself that way. Yet, that's how I make a living."<ref name=Gallagher-39>Carducci; Gallagher, p. 39.</ref> Cimino added, "I started writing screenplays principally because I didn't have the money to buy books or to option properties. At that time you only had a chance to direct if you owned a screenplay which some star wanted to do, and that's precisely what happened with ''Thunderbolt and Lightfoot''."<ref name=Andrews-249/><ref name=Andrews-250>Andrews, p. 250.</ref> Cimino gained representation from Stan Kamen of [[William Morris Agency]].<ref>McGilligan, p. 237.</ref> He co-wrote two scripts (the science fiction film ''[[Silent Running]]'' and [[Clint Eastwood]]'s second [[Dirty Harry (film series)|Dirty Harry]] film, ''[[Magnum Force]]'') before moving on to film directing.<ref name=Bliss-268/> Cimino's work on ''Magnum Force'' impressed Eastwood enough to buy Cimino's [[spec script]] called ''Thunderbolt and Lightfoot'' for Eastwood's production company, [[Malpaso Productions|Malpaso]].

===''Thunderbolt and Lightfoot''===
Cimino moved up to directing on the feature ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'' (1974).<ref name=Hickenlooper-76/> The film stars [[Clint Eastwood]] as a Korean War vet named "Thunderbolt" who takes a young drifter named "Lightfoot", played by [[Jeff Bridges]], under his wing. When Thunderbolt's old partners try to find him, he and Lightfoot make a pact with them to pull one last big heist at Montana Armory. Eastwood was originally slated to direct it himself, but Cimino impressed Eastwood enough to change his mind. The film became a solid box office success at the time, making $25,000,000 at the box office with a budget of $4,000,000.<ref>Eliot, Marc (October 6, 2009). ''American Rebel: The Life of Clint Eastwood'' (1st ed.). New York, NY: Rebel Road, Inc. p. 155. ISBN 978-0-307-33688-0.</ref>

===''The Deer Hunter''===
With the success of ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'', Cimino says he "got a lot of offers, but decided to take a gamble. I would only get involved with projects I really wanted to do." He rejected several offers before pitching an ambitious Vietnam War film to [[EMI]] executives in November 1976. To Cimino's surprise, EMI accepted the film.<ref name=Wakeman/> Cimino went on to direct, co-write, and co-produce ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978). The film stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Christopher Walken]], and [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] as three buddies in a Pennsylvania steel mill town who fight in the Vietnam War and rebuild their lives in the aftermath. The film went over-schedule and over-budget,<ref name=TVO/> but it became a massive critical and commercial success,<ref name=Deeley-197>Deeley, p. 197.</ref> and won five [[Academy Award|Oscars]], including [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] for Cimino.<ref name=Dirks>Dirks, Tim.

===''Heaven's Gate''===
{{main|Heaven's Gate (film)}}
On the basis of his track record, Cimino was given free rein by [[United Artists]] for his next film, ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980). The film came in several times over budget. After its release, it proved to be a financial disaster that nearly bankrupted the studio. ''Heaven's Gate'' became the lightning rod for the industry perception of the loosely controlled situation in Hollywood at that time. The film's failure marked the end of the [[New Hollywood]] era. [[Transamerica Corporation]] sold United Artists, having lost confidence in the company and its management.<ref name=Bach-404>Bach, p. 404.</ref>

''Heaven's Gate'' was such a devastating critical and commercial bomb that public perception of Cimino's work was tainted in its wake; the majority of his subsequent films achieved neither popular nor critical success.<ref name=Bach-420/> Many critics who had originally praised ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' became far more reserved about the picture and about Cimino after ''Heaven's Gate''. The story of the making of the movie, and UA's subsequent downfall, was documented in [[Steven Bach]]'s book ''Final Cut''. Cimino's film was somewhat rehabilitated by an unlikely source: the [[Z Channel]], a cable [[pay television|pay TV]] channel that at its peak in the mid-1980s served 100,000 of Los Angeles's most influential film professionals. After the unsuccessful release of the re-edited and shortened ''Heaven's Gate'', [[Jerry Harvey (screenwriter)|Jerry Harvey]], the channel's programmer, decided to play Cimino's original 219 minute cut on Christmas Eve 1982. The re-assembled movie received admiring reviews.<ref name=Bach-413>Bach, p. 413</ref>

===''Year of the Dragon''===
Cimino directed a 1985 crime drama, ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]'', which he and [[Oliver Stone]] adapted from [[Robert Daley]]'s novel. However, ''Year of the Dragon'' was also nominated for five [[Razzie]] awards, including [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay|Worst Screenplay]].<ref>[[John J. B. Wilson|Wilson, John]] (January 2, 2002). [http://razzies.com/asp/content/XcNewsPlus.asp?cmd=view&articleid=26 "1985 Archive of 6th Annual RAZZIE Awards"]. Razzies.com. Retrieved 2010-05-25.</ref> The film was sharply criticized for providing offensive stereotypes about [[Chinese American]]s.<ref name=Cimino-VF/>

===''The Sicilian''===
<!-- One can't write about this film without discussing Cimino's fight with the studio over final cut.  It ended up in a prolonged lawsuit, ultimately led to two different versions, and it was this lawsuit, and not Heaven's Gate, that truly blackballed him from much of the industry.  Gore Vidal's contribution to the screenplay needs also be discussed. -->
Cimino directed ''[[The Sicilian (film)|The Sicilian]]'' from a [[Mario Puzo]] [[The Sicilian|novel]] in 1987. The film bombed at the box office, costing an estimated $16 million{{#tag:ref|Estimate for ''The Sicilian'' film budget based on: "Total American gross at the box office was $5.5 million, about a third of our production costs."

===''Desperate Hours''===
Cimino directed a [[Desperate Hours|remake]] of the [[Humphrey Bogart]] film ''[[The Desperate Hours (film)|The Desperate Hours]]'' in 1990, starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Mickey Rourke]]. Rourke also appeared in ''Heaven's Gate'' and ''Year of the Dragon''. The film was another box-office disappointment, grossing less than $3 million.<ref name=DH/>

===''Sunchaser''===
Cimino's last feature-length film to date has been 1996's ''[[Sunchaser]]'' with [[Woody Harrelson]] and [[Jon Seda]].

==Unrealized projects==
Since the beginning of his film career, Cimino has been attached to many projects that either fell apart in pre-production or were jettisoned due to his reputation following ''Heaven's Gate''. [[Steven Bach]] wrote that despite setbacks in Cimino's career, "he may yet deliver a film that will make his career larger than the cautionary tale it often seems to be or, conversely, the story of genius thwarted by the system that is still popular in certain circles."<ref>Bach, p. 421.</ref> Film historian [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] added to this sentiment: "The flimsy nastiness of his last four pictures is no reason to think we have seen the last of Cimino.&nbsp;... If he ever emerges at full budgetary throttle, his own career should be his subject."<ref name=Thomson-178/> Cimino claims he has written at least 50 scripts overall<ref name=Cimino-VF/> and was briefly considered to helm ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.<ref>Schumacher, Michael (October 19, 1999).

Among the Cimino projects that have stalled in development or given to other directors include:
<!-- There must be a better way to order this list before. Perhaps, chronologically, if dates can be established. -->

===''The Fountainhead''===
Cimino's dream project has been an adaptation of [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. Taking its cue from more than the novel, it was largely modeled on architect [[Jørn Utzon]]'s troubled building of the [[Sydney Opera House]], as well as the construction of the [[Empire State Plaza]] in [[Albany, New York]]. He wrote the script in between ''[[Thunderbolt and Lightfoot]]'' and ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', and hoped to have [[Clint Eastwood]] play Howard Roark.<ref name=Hickenlooper-78>Hickenlooper, p. 78</ref><ref name="The Right Place"/>

===''Crime and Punishment''===
Cimino's other dream project has been an adaptation of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''.<ref name=Typhoon>Griffin, Nancy (February 10, 2002).

===''Perfect Strangers''===
Cimino spent a year and a half working on a script entitled ''Perfect Strangers'', a political love story. "...&nbsp;It bears some resemblance to ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1942)," said Cimino, "involving the romantic relationship of three people. Someone called it a romantic ''[[Z (1969 film)|Z]]'' (1969). I was very close to doing it. In fact, we'd already shot two weeks of pre-production stuff, but because of various political machinations at the studio, the project fell through. This was just before [[David V. Picker|David Picker]] left. He was the producer. There were internal difficulties, that's all. Nevertheless, I'd spent a year and a half of my life on something. It had been a difficult time. My father passed away while I was writing the screenplay. I kept working&nbsp;..."<ref name=Gallagher-40/>

===''Untitled Porgy & Bess Project''===
One of Cimino's goals since first arriving in Hollywood was to make a film musical.  One of his dream projects was a musical inspired by ''[[Porgy and Bess]]''.  Not an adaptation, it would instead had been a romance about a black gospel singer and a white [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] pianist, as they struggle to mount a production of the opera.<ref name="The Right Place"/>

===''The Life and Dreams of Frank Costello''===
After ''Perfect Strangers'' fell through, Cimino spent two and a half years working with [[James Toback]] on ''The Life and Dreams of Frank Costello'', a biopic on the life of mafia boss [[Frank Costello|Costello]], for [[20th Century Fox]]. "We got a good screenplay together," said Cimino, "but again, the studio, [[20th Century Fox]] in this case, was going through management changes and the script was put aside." Cimino added, "''Costello'' took a long time because Costello himself had a long, interesting life. The selection of things to film was quite hard.<ref name=Gallagher-40/>

===''Pearl''===

Cimino wrote a biography on [[Janis Joplin]] called ''Pearl'' while working on the Costello biopic, both for 20th Century Fox.<ref name=Typhoon/><ref name="Gallagher-40"/> "It's almost a musical," replied Cimino, "I was working with Bo Goldman on that one and we were doing a series of rewrites."<ref name=Gallagher-40/> "All these projects were in the air at once," Cimino recalled, "I postponed ''The Fountainhead'' until we had a first draft on ''Pearl'', then after meetings with Jimmy began Frank Costello."<ref name=Gallagher-40>Carducci; Gallagher, p. 40</ref>

===''Conquering Horse''===
Cimino also wanted to write and direct an adaptation of [[Frederick Manfred]]'s Western novel ''[[Conquering Horse]]'', an epic, set in pre-white America, to have been shot in the [[Sioux language]].<ref name="Ciment, Michel 1981">Ciment, Michel; Henry, Michael (September 1981).

<!-- Check audio commentary of Footloose for more info. -->
In 1984, after being unable to finalize a deal with director [[Herbert Ross]],  [[Paramount Pictures]] offered the job of directing ''Footloose'' to Cimino. According to screenwriter [[Dean Pitchford]], Cimino was at the helm of ''Footloose'' for four months, making more and more extravagant demands in terms of set construction and overall production. In the process Cimino reimagined the film as a musical-comedy inspired by ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]''. Paramount realized that it potentially had another ''Heaven's Gate'' on its hands. Cimino was fired and Ross was brought on to direct the picture.<ref name="The Right Place">Chevrie, Marc; Narboni, Jean; Ostria, Vincent (November 1985). "The Right Place" (in French).

===''[[The Pope of Greenwich Village]]''===
<!-- There has been some talk about how Cimino helped Rosenberg during production. If anyone can find reliable sources, please put it down! -->
Cimino was scheduled to work on ''Pope'', which would have reunited him with actor Mickey Rourke from ''Heaven's Gate''. After Rourke and [[Eric Roberts]] signed on as the leads, Cimino wanted to finesse the screenplay with some rewriting and restructuring. However, the rewriting would have taken Cimino beyond the mandated start date for shooting, so Cimino and MGM parted ways. [[Stuart Rosenberg]] was hired as a result.<ref name=Heard-42>Heard, p. 42.</ref> The film, while receiving admiring reviews, bombed at the box office.

===''Legs Diamond Bio Pic''===
An article in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' about actor Leonardo Termo (Angelo Rizzo in ''Year of the Dragon'') touched on how Termo and Mickey Rourke were friends, and how Termo had appeared in most of Rourke's films. The article says "The pair also were set to appear in a Cimino biopic at Embassy Pictures about "Legs" Diamond that never got made, with Rourke as the legendary 1930s gangster and Termo playing his bodyguard." <ref>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lenny-termo-mickey-rourke-seinfeld-384835</ref>

===''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]''===
In the late 1970s, Cimino passed on an offer to direct [[Oliver Stone]]'s adaptation of ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''.  A few years later, he met Stone again, who was optioning his screenplay for ''[[Born on the Fourth of July]]''.  Cimino was eager to make the film, going so far as to offer to work for nothing, even attracting [[Al Pacino]] for the role of [[Ron Kovic]].  The producers declined.  The film was eventually directed by Stone himself in 1989, and the two would later collaborate on ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]''.<ref name="The Right Place"/>

Cimino was in talks to direct ''The Yellow Jersey'', a [[bicycle racing]] drama with a script by Carl Foreman and starring [[Dustin Hoffman]].<ref name=Bliss-268>Bliss, p. 268.</ref>  The project was ultimately abandoned as it proved logistically difficult to shoot during the actual [[Tour de France]].<ref name="The Right Place"/>

===''[[Michael Collins (film)|Michael Collins]]''===
In 1987, Cimino attempted to make an epic saga about the 1920s Irish rebel [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], but the film had to be abandoned due to budget, weather and script problems. The film was to have been funded by [[Nelson Entertainment]].<ref name="Klady"/>

===Collaborations with Raymond Carver===
Cimino worked on two films with the short story writer [[Raymond Carver]].  The first was ''Purple Lake'', a contemporary Western about "juvenile delinquents who return to society after serving time in prison."<ref name="The Right Place"/><ref name="Conversations with Carver">Carver, Raymond; Morrisroe, Patricia (1990). "A Voice from the Wastland". ''Conversations with Raymond Carver''. Univ. Press of Mississippi. p. 81. ISBN 0-87805-449-9.</ref> The other was a biography of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].  Backed by [[Carlo Ponti]], Carver took over from an uncredited [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]].  Heavily researched, and taking Dostoyevsky's near execution as its focal point, the final screenplay was 220 pages long.  Fragments were eventually published by [[Capra Press]].<ref>Sklenica, Carol (2009). ''Raymond Carver: A Writer's Life''. p. 393. Simon and Schuster.

===''Full Circle''===
According to a [[John Woo]] interview, "Currently we are in preproduction at Twentieth Century-Fox. It is a story about five Americans who (due to circumstances beyond their control) become stranded in the Amazon Rainforest. Each has to battle the elements and their own weaknesses to survive. I am very excited about this project. There are things that will be quite challenging for me—the rainforest, underwater scenes, crocodiles, and thousands of extras! We are also planning a project based on a story by me called ''Full Circle''. The director Michael Cimino will be writing the script. The project will have a similar style to ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]''".<ref>http://brightlightsfilm.com/31/hk_johnwoo.php</ref>

===''Santa Ana Wind''===
Shortly after the ''Michael Collins'' biopic was cancelled, Cimino quickly started pre-production work on ''Santa Ana Wind'', a contemporary romantic drama is set in L.A. The start date for shooting was to have been early December 1987. The screenplay was written by [[Floyd Mutrux]] and the film was to be bankrolled by Nelson Entertainment, which also backed ''Collins.'' Cimino's reperesentative added that the film was "about the San Fernando Valley and the friendship between two guys" and "more intimate" than Cimino's previous big-budget work like ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' and the yet-to-be-released ''[[The Sicilian (film)|The Sicilian]]''.<ref name=Klady/> However, Nelson Holdings International Ltd. cancelled the project after disclosing that its banks, including [[Security Pacific National Bank]], had reduced the company's borrowing power after Nelson failed to meet certain financial requirements in its loan agreements. A spokesman for Nelson said the cancellation occurred "in the normal course of business," but declined to elaborate. The film had been budgeted at about $15 million and was to have begun production shortly. The film, intended for distribution by Columbia, didn't feature any major stars.<ref>Cieply, Michael (January 26, 1988).

===''Paradise Junction''===
According to Library Journal Taut. Fast paced. That's Finch's style (demonstrated in Sugarland, LJ 9/1/91), and this latest thriller literally speeds through plot and characters. It's perhaps more cinematic than novelistic, as attested to by Warner's acquisition of the movie rights (Michael Cimino is writing the screenplay). Gorgeous "heroine" Caitlin is totally bored with life and her wealthy husband, Hays, who suddenly finds that his direct-sales business is falling. At Caitlin's instigation, they team up with ex-con Sonny Naull in a series of successful burglaries undertaken more for kicks than for money. Into this mix comes Hays's reprehensible business partner, a Samoan muscleman, a troupe of nasty bikers, and a Marine named Welcome. The action is furious in this thoroughly entertaining novel, but the reader must pay close attention to sort it all out. For popular 
collections.

Cimino was attached to direct ''The Dreaming Place'' in 1997.<ref name=Pittman>Pittman, Jo Ann (September 21, 1999). "Michael Cimino". ''Film Directors''.</ref> The film, which was in the early stages of development, was to be a male vigilante story, along the lines of Paramount's ''[[Eye for an Eye (1996 film)|Eye for an Eye]]''. [[Rodney Vaccaro]] wrote the screenplay under the supervision of Cimino, and Jonathon Komack Martin was to be executive producer. The planned budget was not revealed.<ref name="Trimark's 'Dream' helmer: Cimino">Variety Staff (July 1, 1997).

===''Man's Fate''===
Cimino has written a three-hour-long adaptation of [[André Malraux]]'s [[Man's Fate|1933 novel]] about the early days of the Chinese Revolution.<ref name=Typhoon/><ref name=War-Stories/> The story will focus on several Europeans living in Shanghai during the tragic turmoil that characterized the onset of China's Communist regime.<ref name=HMM>Staff Reporter (September 4, 2001). "Michael Cimino Discovers 'Man's Fate' in Shanghai". ''Home Media Magazine''.</ref> "The screenplay, I think, is the best one I've ever done," adding that he has "half the money; [we're] trying to raise the other half."<ref name=Cimino-VF/> The roughly $25 million project is to be filmed wholly on location in Shanghai and will benefit from the support of China's government, which has said it will provide some $2 million worth of local labor costs.<ref name=HMM/> Cimino has been scouting locations in China since 2001.<ref name=Typhoon/><ref name=TVO>[[Peter Biskind|Biskind, Peter]] (March 2008). [http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/03/warmovies200803 "The Vietnam Oscars"]. ''Vanity Fair''. Retrieved 2010-08-28.</ref><ref name="War-Stories"/> "There was never a better time to try to do ''Man's Fate''", Cimino said, "because ''Man's Fate'' is what it's all about right now. It's about the nature of love, of friendship, the nature of honor and dignity. How fragile and important all of those things are in a time of crisis." Martha De Laurentiis, who with [[Dino De Laurentiis|her husband Dino]] helped produce ''Year of the Dragon'' and ''Desperate Hours'' with Cimino, read his script for ''Man's Fate'' and passed on it. "If you edit it down, it could be a very tight, beautiful, sensational movie," she said, "but violent, and ultimately a subject matter that I don't think America is that interested in."<ref name=Typhoon/>

==Books==
In 2001, Cimino published his first novel, ''Big Jane''. Later that year, the French Minister of Culture decorated him [[Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres]]<ref name=Typhoon/> and the Prix Littéraire Deauville 2001, an award that previously went to [[Norman Mailer]] and [[Gore Vidal]].<ref name=Cimino-VF/> "Oh, I'm the happiest, I think, I've ever been!" said Cimino.<ref name=Cimino-VF/> Cimino also wrote a book called ''Conversations en miroir'' with Francesca Pollock in 2003.<ref>Cimino, Michael; Pollock, Francesca (writer) (2003). ''Conversations en miroir'' (in French). Paris: Gallimard.</ref>

==Interviews==
Interviews with Cimino are rare: He declined all interviews with American journalists for 10 years following ''Heaven's Gate''<ref name=Cimino-VF/> and he gives his part in the making of that film little discussion. [[George Hickenlooper]]'s book ''Reel Conversations'' and [[Peter Biskind]]'s highly critical book ''[[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls]]'' deal with the film and resulting scandal.<ref>[[Peter Biskind|Biskind, Peter]] (April 27, 1998). "'Coming Apart' & 'The Eve of Destruction'". ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' (Hardcover, 1st ed.). New York, NY: [[Simon & Schuster]]. ISBN 978-0-684-80996-0.</ref> Hickenlooper's book includes one of the few candid discussions with Cimino; Biskind focuses on events during and after the production as a later backdrop for the sweeping changes made to [[Hollywood]] and the [[New Hollywood|movie brat]] generation. [[Steven Bach]], a former UA studio executive, wrote ''Final Cut'' (1985), which describes in detail how ''Heaven's Gate'' brought down [[United Artists]]. Cimino has called Bach's book a "work of fiction" by a "degenerate who never even came on the set."<ref name=Cimino-VF/> However, Bach's work does discuss times in which he did appear at the shooting location to confront Cimino about the budgetary issues.

While [[Al Pacino]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[Robert De Niro]] all gave interviews for the 2009 [[John Cazale]] documentary ''[[I Knew It Was You]]'', Cimino refused to do so.

However, the [[DVD region code|European DVD release]] of ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' contains an [[audio commentary]]<ref name=Deer-Comm/> with Cimino as does the American DVD release of ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]''.<ref name=Cimino-YOTD>Cimino, Michael (director) (2005). ''Commentary by director Michael Cimino''. [''Year of the Dragon'' Region 1 DVD]. Turner Entertainment Co.</ref>

In 2011, the French movie critic Jean-Baptiste Thoret wrote a large profile on Michael Cimino for ''Les Cahiers du Cinema''. Cimino makes the cover.

In 2013, Thoret publish in France an acclaimed book, ''Michael Cimino, les voix perdues de l'Amérique'' (lost voices of America). Flammarion. ISBN 978-2081261600

==Praise==
<!-- Should add paragraph about Cimino's popularity in France. -->
After Cimino's success with ''The Deer Hunter'', he was considered a "Second Coming" among critics.<ref name=TVO/> In 1985, author Michael Bliss described Michael Cimino as a unique American filmmaker after only three films: "Cimino occupies an important position in today's cinema&nbsp;... a man whose cinematic obsession it is to extract, represent, and investigate those essential elements in the American psyche&nbsp;..."<ref name=Bliss-147>Bliss, p. 147</ref> Frequent collaborator [[Mickey Rourke]] has often praised Cimino for his creativity and dedication to work. On ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', Rourke has said, "I remember thinking this little guy [Cimino] was so well organized. He had this huge production going on all around him yet he could devote his absolute concentration on the smallest of details."<ref>Heard, p. 29.</ref>

<!-- Tarantino has also called Heaven's Gate a "masterpiece" and said the first scene in "Inglorious Basterds" was a tribute to it.  This was during the publicity for the latter, around the time of Cannes. A source should be able to be found. -->  
Film director/screenwriter [[Quentin Tarantino]] has also expressed great admiration and praise for Cimino's ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', especially with regards to the Vietnamese POW [[Russian roulette]] sequence: "The Russian roulette sequence is just out and out one of the best pieces of film ever made, ever shot, ever edited, ever performed.&nbsp;... Anybody can go off about Michael Cimino all they want but when you get to that sequence you just have to shut up."<ref>Joyce, Paul (Director/Producer); Rodley, Chris (Director/Producer). (1994).

==Criticisms==
Cimino has been described by colleagues and critics as vain, self-indulgent, egotistical, megalomaniacal and an ''enfant terrible''.<ref name=Cimino-VF/><ref>Dirks, Tim. [http://www.filmsite.org/filmterms8.html "Cinematic Terms - A FilmMaking Glossary: D2-E1"]. Greatest Films. Retrieved 2011-06-03.</ref> Producers and critics have tended to be harsher on Cimino than his fellow collaborators. Critics, for example, [[Pauline Kael]],<ref name=Kael-35/> [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]]<ref name=Simon>[[John Simon (critic)|Simon, John]] (February 16, 1979). ''New York''. Anthologized in the collection ''Reverse Angle'' (1982).</ref> and John Powers,<ref name=Rainer-311>Rainer, p. 311</ref> have also noted and criticized these qualities in many of the films he has written and directed. Cimino has also been known to give exaggerated, misleading and conflicting stories about himself, his background and his filmmaking experiences.

===Colleagues===
In writing about his experience working on ''[[The Sicilian]]'', producer [[Bruce McNall]] described Cimino as "one part artistic genius and one part infantile egomaniac."<ref name=M&D-103>McNalll & D'Antonio, p. 103</ref> In his book, ''Blade Runners, Deer Hunters and Blowing the Bloody Doors Off'', producer [[Michael Deeley]] described his experience with Cimino on ''Deer Hunter'' a "travail",<ref>Deeley, p. 3</ref> adding "the only flaw I find in my Oscar [for ''The Deer Hunter''] is that Cimino's name is also engraved on it."<ref>Deeley, p. 5</ref> Deeley went on to criticize Cimino further for his deceit and lack of professional respect: "Cimino was selfish.&nbsp;... Selfishness, in itself, is not necessarily a flaw in a director, unless it swells into ruthless self-indulgence combined with a total disregard for the terms in which the production has been set."<ref name=Deeley-178>Deeley, p. 178.</ref> Cinematographer [[Vilmos Zsigmond]] has said that Cimino is hard to work with but extremely talented visually.<ref>''Shooting The Deer Hunter: An interview with Vilmos Zsigmond''. [DVD & Blu-ray]. Blue Underground. Interview with the cinematographer, located on [[The Deer Hunter]] UK Region 2 DVD and [[StudioCanal]] Blu-ray.</ref>

===Critics===
[[Pauline Kael]] and [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] have criticized Cimino's abilities as a filmmaker and storyteller. His failure with ''Heaven<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Gate'' has led many commentators to joke and/or suggest that he give back his Oscars for ''The Deer Hunter''. Pauline Kael in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' described Cimino's storytelling abilities in her review of ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]'':

<blockquote>As I see it, Michael Cimino doesn't think in terms of dramatic values: he doesn't know how to develop characters, or how to get any interaction among them. He transposes an art-school student's approach from paintings to movies, and make visual choices: this is a New York movie, so he wants a lot of blue and harsh light and a realistic surface. He works completely derivatively, from earlier movies, and his only idea of how to dramatize things is to churn up this surface and get it roiling. The whole thing is just material for Cimino the visual artist to impose his personality on. He doesn't actually dramatize himself—it isn't as if he tore his psyche apart and animated the pieces of it (the way a [[D. W. Griffith|Griffith]] or a [[Sam Peckinpah|Peckinpah]] did). He doesn't animate anything.<ref name=Kael-35>Kael, p. 35.</ref></blockquote>

[[John H. Foote|John Foote]] questioned whether or not Cimino deserved his Oscars for ''The Deer Hunter'': "It seemed in the spring of 1979, following the Oscar ceremony, there was a sense in the industry that if the Academy could have taken back their votes — which saw ''The Deer Hunter'' and director Michael Cimino winning for Best Picture and Best Director — they would have done so."<ref name=Foote>Foote, John (June 3rd, 2008). [http://incontention.com/2008/06/03/cimino-oscar-winnerbut-well-deserved/ "Cimino and Oscar"]. incontention.com. Retrieved 2011-05-09.</ref>

[[Peter Biskind]] offered one of the harshest criticisms of Cimino pre-''Heaven<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Gate'' when he described Cimino as "our first, home-grown fascist director, our own [[Leni Riefenstahl]]".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |date=March 30, 1979 |title="Come Back to the Mill, Nick Honey": The Deer Hunter Misses The Target |encyclopedia=Gods and Monsters |publisher=Nation Books |page=91 |location=New York, NY |id= }}</ref>

==Conflicting stories on background==
Cimino has also been known to give exaggerated, misleading and conflicting (or simply tongue-in-cheek) stories about himself, his background and his filmmaking experiences. "When I'm kidding, I'm serious, and when I'm serious, I'm kidding," responded Cimino. "I am not who I am, and I am who I am not."<ref name=Cimino-VF/> Subsequent research by journalists and authors have revealed how and where Cimino has given false information.

===Age===
Cimino has given various dates for his birth, usually shaving a couple of years off to seem younger, including February 3, 1943, November 16, 1943,<ref name="Pittman"/> and February 3, 1952.<ref name=Cimino-VF>Garbarino, Steve (March 2002). [http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/classic/features/ciminos-final-cut-200203 "Michael Cimino's Final Cut"]. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' (499): pp.&nbsp;232–235+250-252. Retrieved 2010-08-27.</ref> Many biographies about Cimino, like the Michael Cimino entries in [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]]'s ''[[The New Biographical Dictionary of Film]]''<ref name=Thomson-178>Thomson, p. 178.</ref> and [[Ephraim Katz]]'s ''Film Encyclopedia'',<ref name=Katz>Katz, Ephraim (1998). ''The Film Encyclopedia'' (3rd ed.). New York, NY: HarperCollins. p. 257. ISBN 0-06-273492-X.</ref> simply list his year of birth as 1943.<ref name=Hickenlooper-76/><ref name="Andrews-245"/> In reference to Cimino's interview with Leticia Kent on December 10, 1978, Steven Bach said, "Cimino wasn't thirty-five but a few months shy of forty."<ref name=Bach-170/>

===Education and early career===
Cimino claimed he got his start in documentary films following his work in academia and nearly completed a doctorate at Yale.<ref name=Bach-169>Bach, p. 169.</ref> Some of these details are repeated in reviews of Cimino's films{{#tag:ref|In Pauline Kael's review of ''The Deer Hunter'', she wrote about Cimino "When his interest turned to movies, he worked in documentary film and in commercials&nbsp;..." <ref>Kael, Pauline (December 18, 1978) "The Deer Hunter: The God-Bless-America Symphony". ''[[The New Yorker]]''.</ref>|group="a"}} or his official bios.<ref name=Katz/><ref name=Andrews-245/> [[Steven Bach]] refuted those claims in his book ''Final Cut'': "[Cimino] had done no work toward a doctorate and he had become known in New York as a maker not of documentaries but of sophisticated television commercials."<ref name=Bach-170/>

===Military service===
During the production of ''The Deer Hunter'', Cimino had given co-workers (such as [[cinematographer]] [[Vilmos Zsigmond]] and [[associate producer]] Joann Carelli) the vague impression that much of the storyline was biographical, somehow related to the director's own experience and based on the experiences of men he had known during his service in Vietnam. Just as the film was about to open, Cimino gave an interview to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in which he claimed that he had been "attached to a [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] medical unit" at the time of the [[Tet Offensive]] of 1968. When the ''Times'' reporter, who had not been able to corroborate this, questioned the studio about it, studio executives panicked and fabricated "evidence" to support the story.<ref name="TVO"/> [[Universal Studios]] president [[Thom Mount]] commented at the time, "I know this guy. He was no more a medic in the Green Berets than I'm a [[rutabaga]]."<ref name=TVO/> Tom Buckley, a veteran Vietnam correspondent for the ''Times'', corroborated that Cimino had done a stint as an Army medic, but that the director had never been attached to the Green Berets. Cimino's active service – just six months in 1962 – had been as a reservist who was never deployed to Vietnam.<ref>Buckley, Tom (April 1980). ''Hollywood's War.'' ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]''.</ref> Cimino's publicist reportedly said that he intended to sue Buckley, but Cimino never did.<ref name=TVO/>

==<!-- "[He] into virtual seclusion, which has, over the years, deepened the sense of mystery brought on by his radically altered physical appear- ance. Even his agent, Mike Wise, says, "Michael is the Howard Hughes of Hollywood."<ref name=Cimino-VF/> Can this quote be used somewhere here? -->Filmography==
