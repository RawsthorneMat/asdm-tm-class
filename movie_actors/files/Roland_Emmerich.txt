==Early life and career==
Emmerich was born in [[Stuttgart]], [[West Germany]], and grew up in the nearby town of [[Sindelfingen]].<ref name="wesuf4">{{cite news | author = Rebecca Ascher-Walsh | title = Space Under Fire | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = August 22, 1995 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293332_4,00.html | accessdate =July 8, 2008}}</ref> As a youth, he traveled extensively throughout Europe and North America on vacations financed by his father, Hans, the wealthy founder of a garden machinery production company.<ref name="cnn1">{{cite news | author = By Hilary Whiteman | title = Roland Emmerich, the accidental director openly gay | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = March 7, 2008 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/02/28/emmerich.history/index.html | accessdate =March 16, 2009}}</ref> In 1977, he began attending [[University of Television and Film Munich]] with the intention of studying to become a production designer.<ref name="cnn1"/><ref name="cnn2"/> After watching ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', he instead decided to enroll in the school's film director program.<ref name="cnn1"/><ref name="Legacy">''The Force Is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars'' Star Wars Original Trilogy DVD Box Set: Bonus Materials, [2004]</ref> Required to create a short film as his final thesis in 1981, he wrote and directed the full-length feature ''[[The Noah's Ark Principle]]'', which was screened as the opening film of the [[34th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1984.<ref name="cnn2">{{cite news | author = By Hilary Whiteman | title = Roland Emmerich: Making it big | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = March 10, 2008 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/02/28/emmerich.director/index.html | accessdate =March 16, 2009}}</ref>

In 1985, he founded Centropolis Film Productions (now [[Centropolis Entertainment]]) in partnership with his sister, producer Ute Emmerich, and directed his major film debut, a fantasy feature named ''[[Joey (1985 film)|Joey]]''.<ref name="cnn1"/> He subsequently directed the 1987 comedy ''[[Hollywood-Monster]]'' and the 1990 science-fiction film ''[[Moon 44]]''. Theatrically, these were only released in and nearby his native country, although Emmerich filmed them in English and went against [[Cinema of Germany|conventional German styles]] in an attempt to appeal to a larger market.<ref name="cnn1"/><ref name="time5"/> This subsequently resulted in ''Moon 44'' being released [[direct-to-video]] in the U.S. in early 1991. ''Joey'' and ''Hollywood-Monster'' eventually also saw home video releases in the U.S. (as ''Making Contact'' and ''Ghost Chase'', respectively) once Emmerich achieved more prominence in America.

==Hollywood director==

===1990s===

Producer [[Mario Kassar]] invited Emmerich to come to the United States to direct a futuristic action film entitled ''Isobar''.<ref name="scifi">{{cite news | author = Patrick Lee, Maria Virobik | title = Devlin's Isobar Moves Forward | publisher = [[Sci Fi Wire]] | date = 21-JULY-06 | url = http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=37195 | accessdate =July 8, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> [[Dean Devlin]], who appeared in ''Moon&nbsp;44'', soon joined Emmerich as his writing and producing partner, and served in this capacity until 2000.<ref name="time5"/> Emmerich subsequently refused the offer to direct after producers rejected Devlin's re-write of the script, and the ''Isobar'' project was eventually scrapped.<ref name="scifi"/> Instead, Emmerich was hired to replace director [[Andrew Davis (filmmaker)|Andrew Davis]] for the action movie ''[[Universal Soldier (1992 film)|Universal Soldier]]''. The film was released in 1992, and has since been followed by [[Universal Soldier (series)|two direct-to-video sequels, a theatrical sequel, and another sequel released in 2010]].

Emmerich next helmed the 1994 science-fiction film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''. At the time, it set a record for the highest-grossing opening weekend for a film released in the month of October.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/month/?mo=10&p=.htm| title=TOP OPENING WEEKENDS BY MONTH | date= | publisher= boxofficemojo.com | accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref> It became more commercially successful than most film industry insiders had anticipated,<ref name="time5"/><ref name="wesuf1">{{cite news | author = Rebecca Ascher-Walsh | title = Space Under Fire | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = July 28, 1995 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293332,00.html | accessdate =July 8, 2008}}</ref> and spawned a highly popular [[Stargate|media franchise]].

Emmerich then directed ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', an alien invasion feature, released in 1996, that became the first film to gross $100 million in less than a week<ref name="EW4">{{cite news | author = A.J.

Retrieved on March 4, 2008.</ref> Emmerich and Devlin then created the television series ''[[The Visitor (TV series)|The Visitor]]'', which aired on the [[Fox Network]] during 1997–1998 before being cancelled after one season.

His next film, ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'', opened in 1998. An extensive advertising and marketing campaign generated significant hype during the months leading up to the film's release. The film was a box office success but was met with negative reviews from critics and fans. It garnered a Saturn Award for Best Special Effects, a BMI Film Music Award, and the Audience Award for Best Director at the European Film Awards while also receiving a Razzie Award for Worst Remake or Sequel. It has only a 26% fresh rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>Godzilla (1998). [review]. Rotten Tomatoes. http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godzilla/ Accessed 7 June 2012.</ref>

===2000s===
Taking a short break from science-fiction, Emmerich next directed the [[American Revolutionary War]] epic ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]''. One of only four films (''Universal Soldier'', ''Anonymous'' and ''[[White House Down]]'' being the others) Emmerich has directed in which he did not contribute to the screenplay, the film received generally favorable critical and commercial response,<ref name="mc1">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/patriot?q=roland%20emmerich|title=The Patriot |date= |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref> and is Emmerich's best-reviewed film to date.<ref name="mc2">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/search/process?sort=relevance&termType=all&ts=roland+emmerich&ty=1&x=42&y=6|title=Roland Emmerich (search results) |date= |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name="rt6">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/roland_emmerich/|title=Roland Emmerich |date= |publisher=rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref> After teaming up with new screenwriting partner [[Harald Kloser]], Emmerich returned once again to directing a visual effects-laden adventure with 2004's blockbuster ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', another disaster film about a rapidly oncoming [[Ice Age]] brought upon by the effects of [[global warming]]. Soon afterward, he founded Reelmachine, another film production company based in Germany.

In 2008, Emmerich directed ''[[10,000 BC (film)|10,000 BC]]'', a film about the journeys of a prehistoric tribe of [[Woolly mammoth|mammoth]] hunters. It was a box office hit, but consistently regarded by professional critics as his worst film, as well as one of the worst films of the year.<ref name="rt7">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/browser.php?navsection=home&type=2&genre=&subgenre=&tomatometer=0%s&numreviews=&mpaa=&letter=&decade=2000s&year=&video_format=&title_search=&person_search=&plot_search=&sort=OrigReleaseYear+DESC&start_index=0&page=1|title=Tomato Picker 2008 films with <10% "fresh" ratings|date= |publisher=rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref> He was slated to direct a remake of the 1966 science-fiction film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'',<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970307.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&query=fantastic+voyage| title=Emmerich to captain 'Voyage' | date=August 15, 2007 | publisher= variety.com | accessdate=August 15, 2007 | first=Michael | last=Fleming}}</ref> but the project slipped back into [[development hell]].

===2010s===
Emmerich's next film, ''[[Anonymous (film)|Anonymous]]'', released on 28 October 2011, is based on the premise that [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]] is the real author of the plays and sonnets of [[William Shakespeare]].<ref>[http://www.coronacomingattractions.com/scoops/october-9-2009-anonymous-roland-emmerich-talks-about-his-next-project Coming Attractions]</ref> According to Emmerich, "It’s an historical thriller because it’s about who will succeed [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and the struggle of the people who want to have a hand in it. It's the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]] on one side and the [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Cecil]]s on the other, and in between [the two] is the Queen. Through that story we tell how the plays written by the Earl of Oxford ended up labelled 'William Shakespeare.'"<ref name=empire>{{cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=27133|title=Roland Emmerich's Next Is 'Anonymous' About Shakespeare|last=de Semlyen|first=Phil |date=February 25, 2010|work=Bauer Consumer Media|publisher=''[[Empire Online]]''|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> The release date for ''Anonymous'' coincided with the completion of the 13th [[Baktun]], the date which marks the empirical base for Emmerich's film ''2012'', as this is celebrated by the surviving indigenous Maya, specifically the [[K'iche' people|Quiché]] people.

Emmerich directed the action-thriller film ''[[White House Down]]'', which involved an assault on the [[White House]] by a [[Paramilitary|paramilitary group]]. The spec script was written by [[James Vanderbilt]] and was purchased by Sony Pictures for {{nowrap|$3 million}} in March 2012. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called it "one of the biggest spec sales in quite a while". The journal said the script was similar "tonally and thematically" to the films ''[[Die Hard]]'', ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' and ''[[Olympus Has Fallen]]'' (2013). Emmerich began filming in July 2012 at the La Cité Du Cinéma in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec, Canada]]. The film was released on June 28, 2013 in the United States.

===Criticisms===

Reviewers often criticize that Emmerich's films rely too heavily on visual effects, and suffer from [[cliché]] dialogue, flimsy and formulaic narrative, numerous scientific and historical inaccuracies, illogical plot development, and lack of character depth.<ref name="rt2">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/godzilla/ |title=The Day After Tomorrow (2004) |date= |publisher=rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name="rt3">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1098149-patriot/ |title=The Patriot (2000) |date= |publisher=rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name="rt4">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10000_bc/ |title=10,000 BC (2008) |date= |publisher=rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref> Emmerich contends that he is not discouraged by such negative criticism, and that he aims to provide enjoyable "popcorn" entertainment to movie-going audiences.<ref name="CC"/> Stating that he is "a filmmaker, not a scientist", he creates his own fiction based on actual science or history to make the messages he sends "more exciting".<ref name="black">{{cite news | author = Todd Gilchrist | title = The Day After Tomorrow: An Interview with Roland Emmerich| publisher = blackfilm.com | date = May 2004 | url = http://www.blackfilm.com/20040528/features/rolandemmerich.shtml | accessdate =March 16, 2009}}</ref>

In response to accusations of insensitivity for including scenes of [[New York City]] being destroyed in ''The Day After Tomorrow'', less than three years after the [[September 11 attacks]], Emmerich claims that it was necessary to depict the event as a means to showcase the increased unity people now have when facing a disaster, because of 9/11.<ref name="CC">{{cite news | author = Thomas Chau | title = INTERVIEW: Director Roland Emmerich on "The Day After Tomorrow" | publisher = Cinema Confidential | date = May 27, 2004 | url = http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0405271 | accessdate =March 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name="black"/><ref name="ugo"/>  When accused of resorting too often to scenes of cities being subjected to epic disasters, Emmerich says that it is a justified way of increasing awareness about both global warming, and the lack of a [[government]] preparation plan for a global doomsday scenario in the cases of ''The Day After Tomorrow'' and ''2012'' respectively.<ref name="black"/><ref name="FS">{{cite news | author = By Alex Billington | title = Roland Emmerich (Almost) Explains What Happens in 2012 | publisher = Firstshowing.net | date = March 3, 2008 | url = http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/03/03/roland-emmerich-almost-explains-what-happens-in-2012/ | accessdate =March 16, 2009}}</ref>

Acknowledging what he was told were flaws with ''Godzilla'', Emmerich admitted he regretted having agreed to direct it. He stated that his lack of interest in the previous [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla movies]], the short time he promised it would take for him to complete the film, and the studio's refusal to screen it for test audiences were all factors that may have negatively affected the quality of the final product,<ref name="ugo"/> and cited the former reason as to why he turned down an offer to direct ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' as he could not imagine himself as getting enthusiastic about the project because he was never intrigued by [[comic books]] and [[superhero]]-related fiction.<ref name="ugo">{{cite news | author = Daniel Robert Epstein | title = Roland Emmerich of The Day After Tomorrow (20th Century Fox) Interview | publisher = UGO | date = | url = http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmTv/features/thedayaftertomorrow/rolandemmerich.asp | accessdate =March 16, 2009}}</ref> However, Emmerich still defends ''Godzilla'', noting that the film was highly profitable<ref name="ugo"/> and claiming that, of all his movies, people tell him ''Godzilla'' is the one they and their kids watch the most repeatedly.<ref name="black"/>

Emmerich has claimed that he witnessed overt racism when producers and studio executives were opposed to allowing him to cast [[Will Smith]] for the lead in ''Independence Day'', and reluctant to allow him to portray an interracial couple in ''The Day After Tomorrow''.<ref name="TDATcomm">''The Day After Tomorrow'' Director/Producer DVD Commentary (2004)</ref> He has also claimed that he has encountered [[homophobia]] from the same groups, and is vocal in his opposition of such behavior.<ref name="TDATcomm"/> He has stated that sometimes he does "[not like working in] the movie business", describing it as a sometimes "very cold, brutal business", but his motivation to keep directing is that he genuinely "like[s] making movies".<ref name="cnn1"/>

In 2006, he pledged $150,000 to the Legacy Project, a campaign dedicated to gay and lesbian film preservation.
