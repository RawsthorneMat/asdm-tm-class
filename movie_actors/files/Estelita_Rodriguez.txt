== Early life and career ==
Rodriguez's career began in 1942 when she was won a contract with [[MGM]] at the age of 14, and continued to go to MGM school in preparation to make a movie.  However, MGM dropped her at the last minute, and Rodriguez traveled back to New York until 1945 when she signed a 5- picture deal with [[Republic]].

Her first movie was ''[[Along the Navajo Trail (film)|Along the Navajo Trail]]''.  Though it made her career take a better turn, Rodriguez did not enjoy making the movie, and reportedly said the following, "Everyone treats me like a kid.  I am a mother."  Soon after this, she starred with western favorites [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Dale Evans]] in ''[[Twilight in the Sierras]]'' in 1950 and ''[[In Old Amarillo]]'' with Rogers.

She concluded her career with Republic in 1952, and her last film was ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]''.
In 1959, she appeared in Rio Bravo with John Wayne, Dean Martin and Walter Brennan.

In January 1953, Rodriguez married actor [[Grant Withers]], an ex-husband of [[Loretta Young]].  [[John Wayne]] served as the best man at the wedding.  They divorced in 1955.

Her third marriage was to Ismael Alfonso Halfss in 1956.  They divorced in 1960.
Her fourth and final marriage was to Dr. Ricardo A. Pego in 1961.  They remained married until her death.
