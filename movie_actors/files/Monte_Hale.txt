Often reported to have been born in [[San Angelo, Texas]], he was actually born as '''Buren Ely''' in [[Ada, Oklahoma]]; a Texas birthplace reportedly sounded better for the movies.<ref>[http://www.b-westerns.com/mhale2.htm B-Westerns]</ref> Starting to sing and play the guitar at an early age, Hale started playing in cities of Texas as well in [[Vaudeville]] and local [[rodeo]] shows. He then got a job during [[World War II]] as a replacement guitarist with the ''[[Stars Over Texas]]'' Bond Drive. Hale had joined with several [[Republic Pictures]] celebrities and staff. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

After signing with the company for seven years, he changed his name from ''Buren Ely'' to ''Monte Hale''. He soon starred in his first major role in ''Home on the Range'' (1946 film). During his film run in the early 1950s, he began to sing at rodeos and circuses. He soon retired from movies and began to appear at western conventions. In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>[http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated]</ref>

On November 12, 2004, for his work in movies, he received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He was also instrumental in the foundation of what is now the [[Autry National Center]] of the American West.<ref name=LATObit/>
