'''Nina Quartero''' (March 17, 1908 - November 23, 1985) was a motion picture actress from [[New York City]], whose career spanned the years 1928 - 1943. Often she played supporting roles and sometimes a diversive love interest for the lead male actor.

In ''One Stolen Night'' (1929) Quartero was cast with [[Betty Bronson]] and [[William Collier]]. The story concerns a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[World War I]] soldier who comes to the assistance of an enslaved dancer. In ''[[Frozen River (1929 film)|Frozen River]]'' (1929) she was paired with [[Raymond McKee]] as the motion picture's romantic leads. Wonder dog [[Rin Tin Tin]], is the most unlikely of heroes in the screen drama.

In 1931 Quartero appeared in ''[[Arizona (1931 film)|Arizona]]'', an early [[John Wayne]] movie. Playing "Conchita," she is a source of strife in Wayne's relationship to the characters depicted by [[Laura La Plante]] and [[June Clyde]]. She performed again with Wayne in ''[[The Man from Monterey]]'' (1933).

Her final screen performances show Quartero playing smaller parts, such as the role of a [[Cubans|Cuban]] dancer in ''Torchy Blane In Panama'' (1938), a native dancer in ''[[Green Hell (film)|Green Hell]]'' (1940) and a bar-girl in ''[[A Lady Takes a Chance]]'' (1943).

Nina Quartero died in [[Woodland Hills, California]] in 1985.

==Publicity seeker==

Quartero once tried a publicity stunt by claiming that she was betrothed to [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] [[All-American]] [[Quarterback]] [[Frank Carideo]]. Carideo demanded a retraction of Quartero's engagement announcement, although admitted he knew her from a time when each resided in [[Mount Vernon, New York]]. He had also visited her home, in [[Beverly Hills, California]], prior to the 1930 [[University of Southern California]] game, to exchange greetings.
