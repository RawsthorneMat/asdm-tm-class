==Early life==
Katy Jurado was born María Christina Jurado García on January 16, 1924, in [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]], [[Mexico]]. Her parents were Luis Jurado Ochoa and Vicenta Estela García de la Garza. One of three children (her brothers were Luis Raul and Oscar Sergio), Jurado had a privileged childhood. Both her maternal and paternal families were wealthy; six generations earlier, they had owned much of the land that became the state of [[Texas]].<ref name="Rodríguez, Clara">Roríguez, Clara. ''Heroes, Lovers, and Others'', p.117</ref> Both families lost much of their wealth during the [[Mexican revolution]]. Family's lands were confiscated by the federal government for redistribution to the landless peasantry.<ref name="Porter, Darwin">Porter, Darwin. ''Brando Unzipped'', p.395</ref> However, Jurado still lived well. Her father was a cattle baron and orange farmer, and her mother was a well-known opera singer who gave up the stage to marry and raise a family. Jurado's cousin, [[Emilio Portes Gil]], was president of Mexico beginning in 1928. Despite the loss of property, the matriarch of the family, her grandmother, continued to live by her aristocratic ideals.

She studied journalism. Discovered by Director [[Emilio Fernández]] when she was sixteen, Jurado went against family wishes and began pursuing a career in acting. Emilio Fernández wanted to cast her in one of his films (''La isla de la pasión''), but Jurado's grandmother objected to her wish to become a movie actress. To get around the ban, Katy slipped from the grasp of her family's control by marrying the Mexican actor and writer Víctor Velázquez against her parents' wishes.<ref name="Ruiz & Sánchez Korrol"/> Together, they had a son and a daughter, Víctor Hugo and Sandra.<ref name="Ruiz & Sánchez Korrol"/> The marriage ended in divorce in 1943, and the children remained with Jurado's family in Mexico when she traveled to the United States to work.

==Career==
===1940's===

Jurado began acting in Mexican films from 1943. She debuted in the movie ''No matarás'', directed by  [[Chano Urueta]], with [[Emilio Tuero]] and [[Carmen Montejo]]. She went on to appear in sixteen more films over the next seven years in the early years of the [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema]]. Her very particular features were the key to her success. Gifted with a breathtaking beauty and an assertive personality, Jurado specialized in playing wicked and seductive women in a wide variety of films. Her second film was ''Internado para señoritas'' (1943), with [[Mapy Cortés]] and Emilio Tuero. In the same year, she had her first success with her third film, ''La vida inútil de Pito Pérez'' along the comedian Manuel Medel, considered by many as the best Mexican picaresque novel. The film was directed by [[Miguel Contreras Torres]]. With Contreras Torres and Medel, Jurado also filmed the film ''Bartolo toca la flauta'' (1944). Other highlights of her early films were ''Balajú'' (1944), with [[David Silva]] and the Cuban rumbera [[María Antonieta Pons]]; ''Rosa del Caribe'' (1945), with [[Maria Elena Marqués]]; ''Soltera y con gemelos'' and ''La viuda celosa'' (1945), films created as a vehicle for showcasing for the singer [[Amanda Ledesma]]: ''Guadalajara pues'' and ''El último chinaco'' (1946), both with [[Luis Aguilar (actor)|Luis aguilar]], and ''Prisión de sueños'' (1946), along [[Esther Fernandez]]. In 1947 Jurado acts on the film ''Hay lugar para ... dos'' sequel to the hit film ''¡Esquina bajan!'' (1946), starring David Silva. In 1948, her performance in ''[[Nosotros los pobres]]'', directed by [[Ismael Rodríguez]], with [[Pedro Infante]], brought her great popularity.

In addition to acting, Jurado worked as a movie columnist, radio reporter and bullfight critic to support her family.<ref name="Porter, Darwin"/>  She was on assignment when Director [[Budd Boetticher]] and actor [[John Wayne]] spotted her at a bullfight.<ref name="Rodríguez, Clara"/> Neither knew at the time that she was an actress. However, Boetticher, who was also a professional bullfighter, cast Jurado in his 1951 film ''[[Bullfighter and the Lady]]'', opposite [[Gilbert Roland]] as the wife of an aging matador. Jurado stayed close to home, as the film was made on location in Mexico. At that time, Jurado had very limited English language skills. She memorized and delivered her lines phonetically.<ref name="Rodríguez, Clara"/> Despite this handicap, her strong performance brought her to the attention of Hollywood producer [[Stanley Kramer]]. Kramer cast her in the classic Western ''[[High Noon]]'', starring [[Gary Cooper]] and [[Grace Kelly]].
Jurado quickly learned to speak English for the role, studying and taking classes two hours a day for two months. Jurado delivered a powerful performance as the saloon owner Helen Ramírez, former love of reluctant hero Will Kane, in one of the most memorable films of the era.<ref name="Rodríguez, Clara"/> She earned a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Supporting Actress and gained widespread notice in the American movie industry.<ref name="Ruiz & Sánchez Korrol"/>

In 1953 she starred in [[Luis Buñuel]]'s box-office success ''[[El Bruto]]'', with [[Pedro Armendáriz]], for which she received an [[Ariel Award]].<ref name="Rodríguez, Clara"/> She also filmed in Mexico some films made in English,  like ''El Corazón y La Espada'' (1953, opposite [[Cesar Romero]]) and ''Mujeres del Paraíso'' (1954, opposite [[Dan O'Herlihy]]). The same year, she starred in ''[[Arrowhead (film)|Arrowhead]]'' with [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Jack Palance]], playing a Comanche woman, the love-interest of Heston's character.

The studios wanted her off the film, but Jurado asked for 24 hours to review footage of her scenes. After all, the studios were impressed.<ref>{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Revista Somos: Katy Jurado:Estrella de Hollywood orgullosamente mexicana|publisher=Editorial Televisa S.A de C.V|year=1999|pages= 30|isbn= }}</ref> Only two other Mexican actresses have been nominated since then: [[Salma Hayek]] as Best Actress in 2002 for ''[[Frida]]'' and [[Adriana Barraza]] as Best Supporting Actress in 2006 for ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]''.

[[File:Jurado-Borgnine-Badlanders.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Jurado with [[Ernest Borgnine]] in the [[1958 in film|1958 film]] ''[[The Badlanders]]'' (1958)]]

With Velázquez fathered two Children, Sandra and Victor. Victor died tragically in an accident on a highway near [[Monterrey]], plunging Katy into a deep sadness that she could never overcome, and that led her to abandon her acting career for a few years.

Early in her career in Hollywood, Jurado had affairs with [[John Wayne]], [[Budd Boetticher]]  and [[Tyrone Power]].
[[Marlon Brando]] was smitten with Katy Jurado after seeing her in ''[[High Noon]]''. He was involved at the time with [[Movita Castaneda]] and was having a parallel relationship with [[Rita Moreno]]. Brando told [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] that he was attracted to "her enigmatic eyes, black as hell, pointing at you like fiery arrows".<ref name="Porter, Darwin">Porter, Darwin. ''Brando Unzipped'', p.394</ref> They struck up a close friendship when Brando filmed ''[[Viva Zapata!]]'' in Mexico. Jurado recalled years later in an interview that "Marlon called me one night for a date, and I accepted. I knew all about Movita. I knew he had a thing for Rita Moreno. Hell, it was just a date. I didn't plan to marry him".<ref name="Porter, Darwin"/>  However, their first date became the beginning of an extended affair that lasted many years and peaked at the time they worked together on ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1960), a film directed by Brando.<ref name="Porter, Darwin"/>

During the filming of the movie ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'' in [[Cuernavaca]], Jurado met the American actor [[Ernest Borgnine]], who became her second husband on December 31, 1959. They filmed together the film ''[[The Badlanders]]'' in 1959. The couple founded the movie production company ''SANVIO CORP''.

However, her true love was the western novelist [[Louis L'Amour]]. Jurado said: ''"I have love letters that he wrote me until the last day of his life''.<ref>{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Revista Somos: Katy Jurado:Estrella de Hollywood orgullosamente mexicana|publisher=Editorial Televisa S.A de C.V|year=1999|pages= 32|isbn= }}</ref>

She's like [[Anna Magnani]], but flavored tequila and lemon."''.<ref>García Riera (1999), p. 114</ref>  

Katy Jurado also claimed to be one of the first people to find the body of Mexican actress [[Miroslava Stern]] after her tragic suicide. According to Katy, the picture that Miroslava had between her hands, was [[Cantinflas]], but artistic manager Fanny Schatz exchanged the photo for one of the Spanish bullfighter [[Luis Miguel Dominguín]].<ref>{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Revista Somos: Katy Jurado:Estrella de Hollywood orgullosamente mexicana|publisher=Editorial Televisa S.A de C.V|year=1999|pages= 100|isbn= }}</ref>
