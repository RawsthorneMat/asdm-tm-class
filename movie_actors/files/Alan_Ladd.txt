'''Alan Walbridge Ladd''' (September 3, 1913&nbsp;– January 29, 1964) was an American actor and film and television producer. Ladd found success in film the 1940s and early 1950s, particularly in [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and [[film noir]]s where he was often paired with [[Veronica Lake]]. His popularity diminished in the late 1950s, though he continued to appear in popular films until his accidental death due to a lethal combination of alcohol, a barbiturate, and two tranquilizers.<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', February 5, 1964, page 63.</ref>

==Early life==
Ladd was born in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]. He was the only child of Ina Raleigh (also known as Selina Rowley) and Alan Ladd, a freelance accountant.<ref>http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2767</ref> His mother was English, from County Durham. His father died when he was four, and his mother relocated to [[Oklahoma City]], where she married Jim Beavers, a housepainter. The family then moved again to the [[North Hollywood]] section of [[Los Angeles]] where Ladd became a high school swimming and diving champion and participated in high school dramatics at [[North Hollywood High School]], graduating on February 1, 1934. He opened his own hamburger and malt shop, which he called Tiny's Patio. He worked briefly as a studio carpenter (as did his stepfather) and for a short time was part of the [[Universal Pictures]] studio school for actors. But Universal decided he was too blond and too short and dropped him.<ref name="linet" />

==Career==
Intent on acting, he found work in small theatres.<ref>"Alan Ladd Urges Training for Films", Schallert, Edwin. ''Los Angeles Times'' 28 May 1950: D1.</ref> He had short term stints at MGM and RKO, and eventually started getting steady work on radio.<ref name="ReferenceA">"The Gent Is Alan Ladd, the Calculating Trigger-Man in 'This Gun for Hire'" by John R. Franchey. ''New York Times'' 7 June 1942: X4.</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article78120072 |title=Biography of Alan Ladd. |newspaper=[[The Border Watch]]|location=Mount Gambier, SA |date=28 November 1942 |accessdate=9 December 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

===Sue Carol===
Ladd was heard on radio by the agent [[Sue Carol]] who signed him to her books and enthusiastically promoted her new client, starting with the 1939 film ''[[Rulers of the Sea]]'', in which he played a character named "Colin Farrell." Ladd began by appearing in dozens of films in small roles, including ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', in which he played a newspaper reporter towards the end of the film. He first gained some wide recognition with a featured role in the wartime thriller ''[[Joan of Paris]]'', 1942.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=161109 Alan Ladd 8/12<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Stardom===
[[File:Brian-Donlevy-Esther-Fernandez-Alan-Ladd-Two-Years-Before-the-Mast.jpg|thumb|right|Ladd with [[Brian Donlevy]] and [[Esther Fernández]] in ''[[Two Years Before the Mast (film)|Two Years Before the Mast]]'' (1946).]]
For his next role, Sue Carol found a vehicle which made Ladd's career: the 1942 adaptation of [[Graham Greene]]'s novel ''[[This Gun for Hire]]'' in which he played "Raven", a hitman with a conscience.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> "Once Ladd had acquired an unsmiling hardness, he was transformed from an extra to a phenomenon. Ladd's calm slender ferocity make it clear that he was the first American actor to show the killer as a cold angel." – David Thomson (''A Biographical Dictionary of Film'', 1975) <ref name="tedstrong.com">[http://www.tedstrong.com/alanladdrip.shtml Alan Ladd<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Both the film and Ladd's performance played an important role in the development of the "gangster" genre: "That the old fashioned motion picture gangster with his ugly face, gaudy cars, and flashy clothes was replaced by a smoother, better looking, and better dressed bad man was largely the work of Mr. Ladd." – ''New York Times'' obituary (January 30, 1964).<ref name="tedstrong.com"/> Ladd was teamed with actress [[Veronica Lake]] in this film, and despite the fact that it was [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] who played the romantic lead, the Ladd-Lake pairing captured the public's imagination, and would continue in another three films. (They appeared in a total of seven films together, but three were only guest shots in all-star musical revues.)

Ladd and Lake became a particularly popular pairing because, at 5'1", she was one of the few Hollywood actresses shorter than him.<ref name=lenburg>{{cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=Peekaboo: The Story of Veronica Lake|year=2001|publisher=iUniverse|location=Lincoln NE|isbn=978-0595192397|pages=95–96|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nPcMRSAXP8gC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=alan%20ladd&f=false}}</ref> In his memoirs, actor/producer [[John Houseman]] wrote of Ladd: "Since he himself was extremely short, he had only one standard by which he judged his fellow players: their height".<ref>{{cite book|last=Houseman|first=John|title=Unfinished business: memoirs, 1902–1988|year=1989|publisher=Applause Theatre Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1557830241|page=260}}</ref> To compensate for Ladd's height, during the filming of ''[[Boy on a Dolphin]]'', co-starring the much taller [[Sophia Loren]], the cinematographer used special low stands to light Ladd and the crew built a ramp system of heavy planks to enable the two actors to stand at equal eye level.<ref>{{cite book|last=Udel|first=James C.|title=The Film Crew of Hollywood: Profiles of Grips, Cinematographers, Designers, a Gaffer, a Stuntman and a Makeup Artist|year=2013|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson NC|isbn=978-0-7864-6484-5|page=87|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aVdOAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> In outdoor scenes, trenches were dug for Loren to stand in.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Paul and John Williams Malone|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Acting|year=2001|publisher=Alpha|location=Indianapolis|isbn=978-0028641539|page=122|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vYbMissSHP8C&pg=PA122&dq=alan+ladd+height+problem&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wSq2UqywK-6E2wXx2IGABQ&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=alan%20ladd%20height%20problem&f=false}}</ref> For the film ''[[Saskatchewan (film)|Saskatchewan]]'', director [[Raoul Walsh]] had a six-inch hole dug for co-star [[Hugh O'Brian]] to stand in, while using the excavated dirt to build a mound for Ladd to stand on, thereby overcoming the one-foot disparity in height.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Marilyn Ann|title=Raoul Walsh: The True Adventures of Hollywood's Legendary Director|year=2011|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington|isbn=978-0813133935|page=334|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Rj2uMkfjDAgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

Ladd went on to star in many [[Paramount Pictures]]' films,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=0x8AFchW4JsC&pg=PA229&dq=%22Alan+Ladd%22+dead+OR+death+OR+died&lr=&cd=13#v=onepage&q=%22Alan%20Ladd%22%20&f=false City of nets: a portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s] By Otto Friedrich</ref> with a brief timeout for military service in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[First Motion Picture Unit]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article97940471 |title=Paula Walling's Hollywood Film Gossip. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|Sunday Mail]] |location=Brisbane |date=19 March 1944 |accessdate=9 December 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

He appeared in [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s story ''[[The Glass Key (1942 film)|The Glass Key]]'', his second pairing with Lake, and ''[[Lucky Jordan]]'' with [[Helen Walker]]. His cool, unsmiling persona proved popular with wartime audiences, and he was quickly established as one of the top box office stars of the decade.<ref>[http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity-biography/alan-ladd.1/ Alan Ladd – Biography – MSN Movies<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1946, he starred in a trio of silver screen classics: the big screen adaptation of [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.|Richard Henry Dana]]'s maritime classic, ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' (for which he also received critical acclaim), the [[Raymond Chandler]] original mystery ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' (his third pairing with Lake), and the World War II espionage thriller ''[[O.S.S. (film)|O.S.S.]]''.

He formed his own production companies for film and radio and then starred in his own syndicated series ''[[Box 13]]'', which ran from 1948–49. Ladd and [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] starred in the 1948 western film, ''[[Whispering Smith]]'', which in 1961 would become a short-lived [[NBC]] [[television series]], starring [[Audie Murphy]]. In the 1949 version of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', Ladd had the featured role of Jay Gatsby.

In 1950 the Hollywood Women's Press Club voted him the easiest male star to deal with in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26745581 |title=STARS WHO PLEASE— AND TEASE. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=14 December 1950 |accessdate=10 July 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

===Leaving Paramount===
[[File:Alan Ladd in Shane.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Jean Arthur and Alan Ladd in ''Shane'' (1953)]]
In 1951 Ladd announced that he would leave Paramount and make five films for Warner Bros. His contract with Paramount was amended so he could only make two more films for that studio but this did not happen. His final movies for paramount were ''Red Mountain'', ''Thunder in the East'', ''Shane'' and ''Botany Bay''.<ref name="one">"PARAMOUNT SIGNS LADD TO NEW PACT: Studio and Actor Arrange for Deal Whereby He Will Make One Film a Year on Lot" by THOMAS M. PRYOR ''New York Times'' 29 Feb 1952: 19.</ref> Ladd later announced that leaving Paramount was "a big upset" for him and he only left for "business reasons... future security for the children and ourselves".<ref name="leave">"THIS LADD STEPPING OUT ON HIS OWN" Scheuer, Philip K. ''Los Angeles Times'' 6 April 1952: E1.</ref>

Although Ladd left Paramount in 1952 the release of his final films was staggered: ''Shane'' and ''Botany Bay'' did not come out until 1953. ''Shane'' was particularly popular and saw Ladd voted as one of the ten most popular stars in the country in 1953.

===Freelance star===
Ladd's films at Warner were made by his own production unit, Jaguar. The first of these was ''The Iron Mistress''.

He then made a movie at Universal, ''[[Desert Legion]]''.

When former agent [[Albert R. Broccoli]] formed [[Warwick Films]] with his partner [[Irving Allen]], they heard Ladd was unhappy with Paramount and was leaving the studio. With his wife and agent [[Sue Carol]], they negotiated for Ladd to appear in the first three of their films made in England and released through [[Columbia Pictures]]: ''[[The Red Beret]]'' (1953); ''[[Hell Below Zero]]'' (1954), based on the [[Hammond Innes]] book ''The White South''; and ''[[The Black Knight (film)|The Black Knight]]'' also (1954). All three were co-written by Ladd's regular screenwriter [[Richard Maibaum]], the last with additional dialogue by [[Bryan Forbes]].<ref>Broccoli, Albert R. & Zec, Donald ''When the Snow Melts: The Autobiography of Cubby Broccoli'' Trans-Atlantic Publications 1999</ref><ref>Bryan Forbes, ''A Divided Life'', Mandarin, 1993 p3-4</ref> In 1954 Ladd formed a new production company, [[Jaguar Productions (1950s company)|Jaguar Productions]], originally releasing his films through [[Warner Bros.]] and then with ''[[All the Young Men]]'' through Columbia.

Ladd's pictures became less distinguished as the decade went on. He turned down the chance to play the role of Jett Rink in ''Giant'' (1956) which was subsequently played by James Dean and became one of the biggest hits of the decade.

In November 1962, he was found lying unconscious in a pool of blood with a bullet wound near his heart, in what might have been an unsuccessful [[suicide]] attempt.<ref name="linet"/><ref>"Alan Ladd Recovering From Shot" ''Los Angeles Times'' 5 Nov 1962: A1.</ref> In 1963 Ladd's career looked set to make a comeback when he filmed a supporting role in ''[[The Carpetbaggers (film)|The Carpetbaggers]]'', which became one of the most popular films of 1964. He would not live to see its release.

==Height==
[[File:Alan Ladd - publicity.JPG|thumb|Ladd, late 1950s]]
Few biographical sources refrain from speculation on Ladd's height, which legend contends was slight.  Reports of his height vary from {{nowrap|5 ft 5 in}}&nbsp;to {{nowrap|5 ft 9 in}} (1.65&nbsp;m&nbsp;– 1.75&nbsp;m), with {{nowrap|5 ft 6 in}} (1.68&nbsp;m) being the most generally accepted today.
