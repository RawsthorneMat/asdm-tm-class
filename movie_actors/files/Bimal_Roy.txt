==Legacy==
Bimal Roy's influence was far-reaching, both in [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]] and [[world cinema]]. In Indian cinema, his influence extended to both mainstream commercial [[Bollywood|Hindi cinema]] and the emerging [[Parallel Cinema]]. His film ''[[Two Acres of Land]]'' (1953) was the first film to successfully stradle art and commercial cinema. It was a commercial and critical success, winning the International Prize at the [[1954 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film's success paved the way for the [[Parallel Cinema|Indian New Wave]] as a result.<ref>{{cite web|title=Do Bigha Zamin: Seeds of the Indian New Wave|author=Srikanth Srinivasan|publisher=Dear Cinema|date=4 August 2008|url=http://dearcinema.com/review-do-bigha-zamin-bimal-roy|accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref><ref name=filmreference>[http://www.filmreference.com/Films-De-Dr/Do-Bigha-Zamin.html Do Bigha Zamin at filmreference]</ref><ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Independent-Film-Road-Movies/India-TRENDS-AND-GENRES.html Trends and genres]</ref>

In commercial cinema, the most influential film he directed was perhaps ''[[Madhumati]]'' (1958), his first and only collaboration with [[Ritwik Ghatak]] (who wrote the screenplay) and one of the earliest films to deal with [[reincarnation]]. It is believed to have been the source of inspiration for many later works dealing with the theme of reincarnation in Indian cinema, [[Television in India|Indian television]], and perhaps world cinema. It may have been the source of inspiration for the American film ''[[The Reincarnation of Peter Proud]]'' (1975) and the Hindi film ''[[Karz (film)|Karz]]'' (1980), both of which dealt with reincarnation and have been influential in their respective cultures.<ref name=Doniger>{{Cite book|last=Doniger|first=Wendy|title=The woman who pretended to be who she was: myths of self-imitation|chapter=Chapter 6: Reincarnation|pages=112–136 [135]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-19-516016-9}}</ref> ''Karz'' in particular was remade several times: as the [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada film]] ''[[Yuga Purusha]]'' (1989), the [[Tamil cinema|Tamil film]] ''[[Enakkul Oruvan]]'' (1984), and more recently the [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Karzzzz (film)|Karzzzz]]'' (2008). ''Karz'' may have also inspired the American film ''[[Chances Are (film)|Chances Are]]'' (1989).<ref name=Doniger/> The most recent film to be directly inspired by ''Madhumati'' is the hit Bollywood film ''[[Om Shanti Om (film)|Om Shanti Om]]'' (2007), which led to Roy's daughter [[Rinki Bhattacharya]] accusing the film of plagiarism and threatening legal action against its producers.

Bimal Roy's films continue to be screened at major national and international film festivals in India, Europe and North America. His films are currently being restored and digitised by the [[National Film Archive of India]] (NFAI) at Pune. In July 2014, [[Prince of Wales Museum]], Mumbai hosted an exhibition, ''Bimal Roy: Life & Times'', organised in collaboration with his children. The exhibits included screening of films, ''Madhumati'', ''Sujata'' and ''Bandini'', besides film posters, costumes and memorobilia, including an Arriflex camera used to shoot ''Devdas'' and ''Sujata''.<ref>{{cite web | title = First in Mirror: Enter Roy’s world|work= Mumbai Mirror| url = http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/others/First-in-Mirror-Enter-Roys-world/articleshow/36861885.cms|author=Reema Gehi|date= 20 June 2014 | accessdate = 7 September 2014 }}</ref> 

A postage stamp, bearing his face, was released by [[India Post]] to honour him on 8 January 2007.
