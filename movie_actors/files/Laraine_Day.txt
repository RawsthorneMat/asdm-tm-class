'''Laraine Day''' (October 13, 1920 – November 10, 2007)<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/13/arts/13day.html?_r=2&ref=arts&oref=slogin&oref=slogin Laraine Day, ‘B+ Movie’ Star, Dies at 87]</ref> was an American actress and a former [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] contract star.

==Career==
Day was born '''La Raine Johnson''' in [[Roosevelt, Utah]], one of eight children in an affluent [[Mormon]] family. She had a twin brother, Lamar.<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/12/local/me-day12|title=Laraine Day, 87; 'Dr. Kildare' film actress had love of baseball|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|date=November 12, 2007|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref> The family later moved to California where she began her acting career with the Long Beach Players. She was a 1938 graduate of [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School|Polytechnic High School]] in [[Long Beach, California]].

In 1937, Day debuted onscreen in a bit part in ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]''. Shortly afterwards, she won lead roles in several [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] westerns at [[RKO]], in which she was billed as "Laraine Hays" and then "Laraine Johnson".

In 1939 she signed with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], and became popular and well-known (billed as Laraine Day) as "Nurse Mary Lamont", the title character's fiancee in a string of seven "[[Dr. Kildare]]" movies beginning with ''Calling Dr. Kildare'' (1939), with [[Lew Ayres]] in the title role.

Her roles for other studios were often far more stimulating than those MGM gave her, including a prominent supporting part in the Irish melodrama ''[[My Son, My Son!]]'' (1940). She also starred in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] thriller ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' (1940) with [[Joel McCrea]], and the psychological mystery ''[[The Locket]]'' (1946) with [[Robert Mitchum]], [[Brian Aherne]], and [[Gene Raymond]]. In 1941 she was voted the number one "star of tomorrow" in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8208562 |title=CUPID'S INFLUENCE ON THE FILM BOX-OFFICE. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1956)]] |location=Melbourne, Vic. |date=4 October 1941 |accessdate=24 April 2012 |page=7 Supplement: The Argus Week-end Magazine |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

She was paired opposite major film stars, including [[Lana Turner]], [[Cary Grant]], and [[John Wayne]], and hosted a TV show alternately called ''Daydreaming With Laraine'' or ''The Laraine Day Show'' (1951). During a time when she had a break in her film career she made her stage debut opposite [[Gregory Peck]] in the national theatre tour of ''[[Angel Street]]''. She also made other stage appearances in ''[[Lost Horizon]]'', the 1973 revival of ''[[The Women (play)|The Women]]'', and a revival of ''[[The Time of the Cuckoo]]''.<ref>http://www.legacy.com/NS/Obituary.aspx?pid=97835077</ref> In the 1940s she made guest appearances on radio in both ''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]'' and ''[[The Screen Guild Theater]]''.

==Personal life==
[[File:Foreign Correspondent trailer 14.jpg|thumb|In ''Foreign Correspondent'' (1940)]]
Day's first marriage was to singer turned airport executive, James Ray Hendricks in 1942.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1569266/Laraine-Day.html|title=Laraine Day|date=November 14, 2007|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref> The couple adopted three children: Christopher, Angela and Michelle.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aB0aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NSUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1380,868417&dq=laraine+day+adopt+chris&hl=en|title=Laraine Day, Husband Adopt Third Child, Boy|date=October 3, 1946|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=12|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref> Day filed for divorce from Hendricks in December 1946.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DcMwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YGoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5190,4719392&dq=laraine+day+ray+hendricks+divorce&hl=en|title=Irate Husband Calls Curocher Love Thief|last=MacPherson|first=Virginia|date=December 5, 1946|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=1|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref> Day was granted an [[interlocutory]] divorce from Hendricks on January 20, 1947, which required her to wait one year before remarrying.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=POIcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=n2QEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1608,1804158&dq=laraine+day+interlocutory&hl=en|title='The Lip' and Actress Incur Judge's Ire; Now Live Apart|date=January 23, 1947|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|page=1|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref>

On January 21, 1947, Day traveled to [[Juarez, Mexico]] where she received a second divorce decree. Later that day, she traveled to [[El Paso, Texas]], where she married baseball manager [[Leo Durocher]]. Upon returning to California, the judge who granted Day's interlocutory divorce from Hendricks stated that the Mexican divorce she received was not legal and, since she failed to wait the one year period for her divorce to become final, deemed her Texas marriage illegal as well. After waiting approximately one year, Day and Durocher remarried on February 16, 1948, in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kJIjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=T6sFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4499,4728750&dq=laraine+day+ray+hendricks+divorce&hl=en|title=Laraine Day and Lippy Wed Again|date=February 16, 1948|work=The Owosso Argus-Press|page=12|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref> During her marriage to Durocher, Day was often referred to as "The First Lady of Baseball". While Durocher was managing the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]], she wrote, ''Day With the Giants'' (1952).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eyFKAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FiINAAAAIBAJ&pg=5356,6422186&dq=laraine+day+adopt&hl=en|title=Leo Durocher and Laraine Day Husband-Wife Team of 1952|date=June 6, 1952|work=Oxnard Press-Courier|pages=6–!|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref>  In 1952, she wrote and published another book entitled ''The America We Love''. She was also the host of ''Day With the Giants'', a 15-minute television interview program broadcast before New York Giants home games. Day and Durocher divorced in June 1960.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n08yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rekFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5640,7564790&dq=laraine+day+adopt&hl=en|title=Laraine Day Divorces Leo|date=June 15, 1960|work=The Miami News|pages=10–A|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref>

On March 7, 1961, Day married television producer [[Michael Grilikhes]]. She and Grilikhes had two daughters, Dana Laraine (born November 13, 1962) and Gigi (born October 6, 1964).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ID8NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YWwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4359,1941491&dq=laraine+day+adopt&hl=en|title=Laraine Day Has Baby Girl|date=November 14, 1962|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=9|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0gZdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=J1oNAAAAIBAJ&pg=675,368337&dq=laraine+day+gigi&hl=en|title=Daughter Born to Laraine Day|date=October 7, 1964|work=St. Joseph Gazette|page=5|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref> After their births, Day rarely appeared in films, and only occasionally appeared on TV, usually portraying matronly types.

===Religion===
Day was a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Day's fame mostly coincided with her dedication to [[Mormonism]]. Throughout her life she never swore, smoked, or drank any kind of [[alcohol]], [[coffee]] or [[tea]]. Until her death in 2007 she retained her Mormon faith stating that, "It brings me comfort in a confusing world".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2007/nov/13/guardianobituaries.obituaries|title=Laraine Day|last=Bergan|first=Ronald|date=2007-11-13|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref>

In 1961 she appeared with the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] in their production of ''Let Freedom Ring'' which was an inspirational one hour program dedicated to the spirit of American Freedom.<ref>[http://www.josephsons.org/slmtc/mtchist.htm Salt Lake Mormon Tabernacle Choir Discography - 04/03/2009]</ref>

==Politics==
Day was as, she described herself, 'very much a Republican'.<ref>http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/l/laraineday630147.html</ref> She was also a vocal supporter for [[Richard Nixon]], whom she later met with at the [[1968 Republican National Convention]], citing him to be the type who would '
go out of his way to help the American people'.<ref>http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/l/laraineday630148.html</ref>

==Later years and death==
In October 1960, Day appeared in the Nixon-Lodge Bumper Sticker Motorcade Campaign in Los Angeles along with [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Cesar Romero]], [[Irene Dunne]], [[Dick Powell]], [[Mary Pickford]] and [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://framework.latimes.com/2012/05/15/get-your-nixon-bumper-stickers/|title=Get your Nixon bumper stickers!|last=Harrison|first=Scott|date=May 15, 2012|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=April 16, 2013}}</ref>

In the 1970s she was the spokesperson for the Make America Better campaign and traveled across the country sharing her views on environmental issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1971/10/improving-our-environment|title=Improving Our Environment|last=Day|first=Laraine|date=October 1971|publisher=''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]''|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref> In that same period of time she was active in establishing a playhouse in Los Angeles for Mormon actors and she helped bring [[Ray Bradbury]]'s work the attention of the public.

Day had moved back to her native Utah in March 2007 following the death of her third husband. She died at her daughter Gigi's home in [[Ivins, Utah]], on November 10, 2007, at the age of 87.<ref name=latimes /> Following her death her body was taken back to California and on November 15, 2007, a memorial service was held at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in the Hollywood Hills.

For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Laraine Day has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6676 Hollywood Blvd.
