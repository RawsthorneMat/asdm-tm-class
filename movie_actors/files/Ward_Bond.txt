==Biography==

===Early life===
Bond was born in [[Benkelman, Nebraska]], a small town located in the southwestern corner of Nebraska near the [[Kansas]] and [[Colorado]] borders. The Bond family, John W., Mabel L., and sister Bernice, lived in Benkelman until 1919 when they moved to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. Ward graduated from [[East High School (Denver)|East High School]] in Denver.

Bond attended the [[University of Southern California]] and played football on the same team as future USC coach [[Jess Hill]].<ref name=28football>{{cite web| title=1928 USC Football Roster| url=http://www.fanbase.com/USC-Trojans-Football-1928| publisher=Fanbase.com| accessdate=2011-10-04}}</ref>  At 6'2" and 195 pounds, Bond was a starting lineman on USC's first [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|national championship]] team in [[1928 college football season|1928]].

Bond and [[John Wayne]], who as Marion Robert Morrison had played tackle for USC in 1926 before an injury ended his career,<ref name="USC26">{{cite web| title=1926 USC Football Roster| url=http://www.fanbase.com/USC-Trojans-Football-1926/roster| publisher=Fanbase.com| accessdate=2011-10-04}}</ref> became lifelong friends and colleagues. Bond, Wayne and the entire Southern Cal team were hired to appear in ''[[Salute (1929 film)|Salute]]'' (1929), a football film starring [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] and directed by [[John Ford]]. During the filming of this movie Bond and Wayne befriended Ford, and appeared in many of Ford's later films.

===Hollywood===

Bond made his screen debut in ''[[Salute (1929 film)|Salute]]'', and thereafter played over 200 supporting roles, rarely playing the lead in a theatrical release but starring in the television series ''[[Wagon Train]]'' from 1957 until his death in 1960. He was frequently typecast as a friendly policeman or as a brutal thug. He had a long-time working relationship with directors [[John Ford]] and [[Frank Capra]], performing in such films as ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', ''[[Drums Along the Mohawk]]'', ''[[The Quiet Man]]'', and ''[[Fort Apache (film)|Fort Apache]]'' for Ford, with whom he made 25 films, and ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' and ''[[Riding High (1950 film)|Riding High]]'' for Capra. Among his other well-known films were ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), ''[[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]]'' (1941), ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' (1945), ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948), in which he was atypically cast as Captain [[La Hire]], ''[[Rio Bravo (1959 film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959), and [[Raoul Walsh]]'s 1930 [[widescreen]] wagon train epic ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which also featured [[John Wayne]]'s first leading role. Bond later starred in the popular [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] western [[television series]] ''[[Wagon Train]]'' from 1957 until his death. ''Wagon Train'' was inspired by the 1950 film ''[[Wagon Master]]'', in which Bond also appeared, and was influenced by ''[[The Big Trail]]''. For ''Wagon Train'' Bond specifically requested [[Terry Wilson (actor)|Terry Wilson]] for the role of assistant trailmaster Bill Hawks and [[Frank McGrath (actor)|Frank McGrath]] as the cook Charlie Wooster. Wilson and McGrath stayed with the series for the entire run.

An [[epilepsy|epileptic]], he was rejected by the [[conscription|draft]] during [[World War II]].

During the 1940s, Bond was a member of the conservative group called the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]], whose major rationale was opposition to [[Communism|communists]] in the film industry.  In 1960, Bond campaigned for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nominee [[Richard M. Nixon]]. Bond died three days before [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John F. Kennedy]] narrowly defeated Nixon.

Bond appears in more of the films on both the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|original]] and the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|tenth anniversary edition]] of the [[American Film Institute]]'s 100 Years... 100 Movies lists than any other actor, albeit always as a supporting player: ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), ''[[The Grapes of Wrath (film)|The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1940), ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) and ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956).

Bond has also been in 11 films that were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], which may be more than any other actor:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sophomorecritic.blogspot.com/2007/02/actors-and-how-many-best-picture.html |title=Actors and how many best picture nominees they've been in |accessdate=2007-06-12 |date=2007-02-18 |work=The Sophomore Critic }}</ref>

===Death and legacy===
[[File:Conflict (1936) 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean Rogers]], John Wayne, and Bond in ''[[Conflict (1936 film)|Conflict]]'' (1936)]]
A legend has developed that country singer [[Johnny Horton]] died in an automobile accident while driving to see Bond at a hotel in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] to discuss a possible role in the fourth season of ''Wagon Train''. Although Horton was indeed killed in a car crash at 1:30 a.m. on November 5, 1960, and Bond died from a massive [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at noon that same day, the two events were unrelated. Horton was on his way from [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], not Dallas. Bond was in Dallas to attend a football game between SMU and Texas A&M at the Cotton Bowl.<ref name="Franks">{{cite web| title=The Legendary Tillman Franks| url=http://www.tillmanfranks.com/biography.htm| publisher=TillmanFranks.com| date=| accessdate=2011-10-04}}</ref><ref>[http://www.woodstock.com/johnny-horton-concerts/ ]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> In addition, since Bond was only the star of ''Wagon Train'' and not a producer, he was not responsible for casting.

Bond was 57 at the time of his death; [[John Wayne]] gave the [[eulogy]] at his funeral. Bond's will bequeathed to Wayne the shotgun with which Wayne had once accidentally shot Bond.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web| title=Biography for Ward Bond| url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000955/bio| publisher=imdb.com| accessdate=2011-10-05}}</ref>

For his contribution to the television industry, Bond has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6933 Hollywood Blvd. In 2001, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]]. There is also a Ward Bond Memorial Park in his birthplace of Benkelman, Nebraska.
