'''Kevin Joseph "Chuck" Connors''' (April 10, 1921 – November 10, 1992) was an American actor, writer and professional basketball and baseball player. He is one of only 12 athletes in the history of American professional sports to have played both [[Major League Baseball]] and in the [[National Basketball Association]]. With a 40-year film and television career, he is best known for his five-year role as [[Lucas McCain]] in the highly rated [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958–63).<ref name=obit/>

==Early life==
Connors was born '''Kevin Joseph <!-- Aloysius -- this might have been his confirmation name. He is shown [http://www.ourchuckconnors.com here] as "Kevin Joseph Aloysius Connors was born on April 10, 1921". --> Connors''' in [[Brooklyn, New York]] to Allan, a longshoreman, and Marcella Connors, immigrants from the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] (now part of [[Canada]]). Connors was raised [[Roman Catholic]] and served as an [[altar boy]] at the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help (Brooklyn, New York)|Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help]] in Brooklyn. Connors had one sibling, a sister, Gloria.<ref name="profile">[http://www.ourchuckconnors.com Profile], ourchuckconnors.com; accessed March 7, 2015.</ref>

Connors did not like his first name and was seeking another one. He tried out "Lefty" and "Stretch" before settling on "Chuck", because while playing first base, he would always yell, "Chuck it to me, baby, chuck it to me!" to the pitcher. The rest of his teammates and fans soon caught on and the name stuck. He loved the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] despite their losing record during the 1930s, and hoped to someday join the team himself. Connors' athletic abilities earned him scholarships to the [[Adelphi University|Adelphi Academy]] (from which he graduated in 1939) and [[Seton Hall University]] in [[South Orange, New Jersey]], which he left after two years.<ref name="profile"/>

During [[World War II]] (1939–45), he enlisted in the [[United States Army|Army]] at [[Fort Knox, Kentucky]], and spent most of the war as a tank-warfare instructor at [[Fort Campbell, Kentucky]] and later at [[West Point, New York]].<ref name="profile"/>

During his Army service, Connors moonlighted as a professional basketball player, joining the [[Rochester Royals]] and helping to lead them to the 1946 [[National Basketball League (United States)|National Basketball League]] championship.<ref name="Sacramento Kings History">{{cite web|title=Sacramento Kings History|url=http://www.nba.com/kings/history/team_history.html|publisher=NBA.com/kings|accessdate=November 29, 2012}}</ref> Following his [[military discharge]] in 1946, he joined the newly formed [[Boston Celtics]] of the [[National Basketball Association|Basketball Association of America]].

Connors left the team for spring training with [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. He played for numerous minor league teams before joining the Dodgers in 1949, for whom he played in only one game. He joined the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 1951, playing in 66 games as a first baseman and occasional pinch hitter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/C/Pconnc101.htm|title=Chuck Connors's career page at|publisher=Retrosheet.org|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref> In 1952, he was sent to the minor leagues again to play for the Cubs' top farm team, the [[Los Angeles Angels (PCL)|Los Angeles Angels]].

He was drafted by the NFL's [[Chicago Bears]], but never suited up for the team. He is also credited as the first professional basketball player to break a backboard. During warmups in the first-ever Boston Celtics game on November 5, 1946 at [[Boston Arena]], Connors took a shot that caught the front of the rim and [[Backboard shattering|shattered an improperly installed glass backboard]].<ref name="ESPN">{{cite journal|title=November Classic Moments|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/moments/9911.html#5|publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref>

In 1966, Connors played an off-field role by helping to end the celebrated holdout by [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitchers [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Sandy Koufax]] when he acted as an intermediary during negotiations between the team and the players.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Katz|first1=Jeff|title=Everybody's a Star: The Dodgers Go Hollywood|url=http://sabr.org/research/everybodys-star-dodgers-go-hollywood|website=SABR.org|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref> Connors can be seen in the Associated Press photo with Drysdale, Koufax and Dodgers general manager [[Buzzie Bavasi]] announcing the pitchers' new contracts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thorp|first1=Ellen|title=Chuck Connors: American Actor/Athlete, Rifleman Star|url=http://trivia.ellenthorp.com/chuck-connors-american-actorathlete-rifleman-star/|website=When Westerns Ruled|accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>

==Acting career==
===Television roles===
Connors realized that he would not make a career in professional sports, so he decided to pursue an acting career. Playing baseball near Hollywood proved fortunate, as he was spotted by an [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] [[casting director]] and subsequently signed for the 1952 [[Spencer Tracy|Tracy]]-[[Katharine Hepburn|Hepburn]] film ''[[Pat and Mike]]''. In 1953, he starred opposite [[Burt Lancaster]] as a rebellious [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] private in the film ''[[South Sea Woman]]'' and ''[[Trouble Along the Way]]'' opposite [[John Wayne]] as a football coach.

Connors had a rare comedic role in a 1955 episode ("Flight to the North") of The ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''. He portrayed Sylvester J. Superman, a lanky rustic yokel who shared the same name as the title character of the series.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0506565/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl ''Adventures of Superman'' episode], imdb.com; accessed March 10, 2015.</ref>

Connors was cast as [[Lou Brissie]], a former professional baseball player wounded during World War II, in the 1956 episode "The Comeback" of the religion [[anthology series]] ''[[Crossroads (1955 TV series)|Crossroads]]''. [[Don DeFore]] portrayed the Reverend C. E. "Stoney" Jackson, who offered the spiritual insight to assist Brissie's recovery so that he could return to the game. [[Grant Withers]] was cast as Coach [[Whitey Martin]]; ''Crossroads'' regular [[Robert Carson (actor)|Robert Carson]] also played a coach in this episode. [[Edd Byrnes]], [[Rhys Williams (actor)|Rhys Williams]], and [[Robert Fuller (actor)|Robert Fuller]] played former soldiers. [[X Brands]] is cast as a baseball player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0550807|title=The Comeback|date=October 5, 1956|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 16, 2013}}</ref><ref name="imdb"/>

In 1957, Connors was cast in the [[Walt Disney]] film, ''[[Old Yeller (1957 film)|Old Yeller]]'' in the role of Burn Sanderson. That same year, he co-starred in ''The Hired Gun''.<ref name="Chuck Connors — Lucas Mcain">The Rifleman The Original Series [http://www.therifleman.net/chuck-connors ''The Riflemen'' website], therifleman.net; accessed March 10, 2015.</ref><ref name="imdb"/>

===Character actor===
Connors acted in feature films including ''[[The Big Country]]'', ''[[Move Over Darling]]'' with [[Doris Day]] and [[James Garner]], ''[[Soylent Green]]'' with [[Charlton Heston]], and ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0175200/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1|title=Chuck Connors (I) (1921–1992)|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>

He also became a lovable television [[character actor]], guest-starring in dozens of shows. His guest-starring debut was on an episode of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Dear Phoebe]]''. He played in two episodes, one as the bandit [[Sam Bass (outlaw)|Sam Bass]], on [[Dale Robertson]]'s NBC western ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]''.<ref name="imdb"/> 

Other television appearances were on ''[[Hey, Jeannie!]]'', ''[[The Loretta Young Show]]'', ''[[Schlitz Playhouse]]'', ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]'', ''[[Screen Directors Playhouse]]'', ''[[Four Star Playhouse]]'', ''[[Matinee Theatre]]'', ''[[Cavalcade of America]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke (TV series)|Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Gale Storm Show]]'', ''[[West Point]]'', ''[[The Millionaire (TV series)|The Millionaire]]'', ''[[General Electric Theater]]'' hosted by [[Ronald W.

===''The Rifleman''===
{{Main|The Rifleman}}
[[File:Chuck Connors The Rifleman 1962.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Publicity still of Connors for ''The Rifleman'', 1962]]
Connors beat 40 other actors for the lead on ''[[The Rifleman]]'', portraying Lucas McCain, a widowed rancher known for his skill with a customized [[Winchester rifle]]. This [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] series, which aired from 1958 to 1963, was also the first show to feature a widowed father raising a young child.<ref name="Chuck Connors — Lucas Mcain"/> Connors said in a 1959 interview with ''[[TV Guide]]'' that the producers of [[Four Star Television]] ([[Dick Powell]], [[Charles Boyer]], [[Ida Lupino]] and [[David Niven]]) must have been looking at 40–50 thirty-something males. At the time, the producers offered a certain amount of money to do 39 episodes for the 1958–59 season. The offer turned out to be less than Connors was making doing freelance acting, so he turned it down. A few days later, the producers of ''The Rifleman'' took their own children to watch ''[[Old Yeller (1957 film)|Old Yeller]]'' in which Connors played a strong father figure. After the producers watched him in the movie, they decided they should cast Connors in the role of Lucas McCain and make him a better offer, including a five-percent ownership of the show.

''The Rifleman'' was an immediate hit, ranking No. 4 in the [[Nielsen ratings]] in 1958–59, behind three other Westerns – ''[[Gunsmoke (TV series)|Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'', and ''[[Have Gun - Will Travel]]''. [[Johnny Crawford]], a former [[Mousketeer]], baseball fan and [[Western (genre)|Western]] buff, beat 40 other young stars to play the role of Lucas's son, Mark. Crawford remained on the series from 1958 until its cancellation in 1963. ''The Rifleman'' landed high in the [[Nielsen ratings]] until the last season in 1962–63, when it was opposite the highly rated return to television of [[Lucille Ball]] on [[The Lucy Show]] and ratings began to drop. The show was cancelled in 1963 after five seasons and 168 episodes.<ref name="imdb"/>

[[File:Chuck Connors Johnny Crawford The Rifleman 1960.JPG|thumb|upright|Connors with Johnny Crawford, 1960]]
Johnny Crawford said of his relationship with Connors: "I was very fond of Chuck, and we were very good friends right from the start. I admired him tremendously." Crawford also said about the same sport that Connors had played: "I was a big baseball fan when we started the show, and when I found out that Chuck had been a professional baseball player, I was especially in awe of him. I would bring my baseball and a bat and a couple of gloves whenever we went on location, and at lunchtime I would get a baseball game going, hoping that Chuck would join us. And he did, but after he came to bat, we would always have trouble finding the ball. It would be out in the brush somewhere or in a ravine, and so that would end the game." {{cn|date=March 2015}}

Crawford stayed in touch with Connors until his death in 1992. "We remained friends throughout the rest of his life. He was always interested in what I was doing and ready with advice, and anxious to help in any way that he could ... He was a great guy, a lot of fun, great sense of humor, bigger than life, and he absolutely loved people. He was very gregarious and friendly, and not at all bashful ... I learned a great deal from him about acting, and he was a tremendous influence on me. He was just my hero." He and Connors reprised their roles as the McCains in a television western movie, ''[[The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw]]''. {{cn|date=March 2015}}

====The rifle====
There were three rifles made for the show. Two identical [[Winchester Model 1892#The '92 goes to Hollywood|44–40 Winchester model 1892]] rifles, one that was used on the show and one for backup, and a Spanish version called an El Tigre used in the saddle holster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riflemansrifle.com/the_riflemans_rifle.htm|title=The Rifleman's Rifle|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref> The rifle levers were modified from the round type to a more "D" shaped in later episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmemorabilia.com/Auctions/AuctionItem?AuctionId=43828|title=Chuck Connors Last Modified Winchester "Rifleman" Style Rifle (w/Connors' family letter and original case)|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>

Two rifles were made for Chuck Connors personally by Maurice "Moe" Hunt that were never used on the show. He was a fan of the show and gave them to Connors. [[Arnold Palmer]], a friend and Honorary Chairman of the annual Chuck Connors charity golf event, was given one of the personal rifles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmemorabilia.com/Auctions/AuctionItem?AuctionId=19584|title=Chuck Connors' Last Modified Winchester "Rifleman" Style Rifle|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref> by Connors and it was on display at the [[The World Golf Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riflemanconnors.com/golf_hall_of_fame.htm|title=The Rifleman's Rifle on display at the World Golf Hall of Fame|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>

The popularity of the show led to tie-in products, such as toy models of the Rifleman's rifle, with the twirl-around-the-trigger lever-action that made the customized rifle a match for any six-shooter hand-gun used by villains. Also a Milton Bradley board game, called "The Rifleman Game", had two players each competing to move their herd of cattle from a Start to a Finish, across a prairie landscape, with a river-crossing and other hazards. The cattle were represented by die-cut cardboard cattle-pieces mounted in plastic counters, red or blue for either player. {{cn|date=March 2015}}

He had a key role against type as a [[slave owner]] in the 1977 [[miniseries]] ''[[Roots (TV miniseries)|Roots]]'', and was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his performance.<ref name=obit/>

Connors hosted a number of episodes of ''[[Family Theater]]'' on the [[Mutual Radio Network]]. This series was aimed at promoting prayer as a path to world peace and stronger families, with the motto, "The family which prays together stays together."

In 1983, Connors joined [[Sam Elliott]] and [[Cybill Shepherd]] in the short-lived [[NBC]] series ''[[The Yellow Rose]],'' about a modern [[Texas]] ranching family. In 1985, he guest-starred as "King Powers" in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[Spenser: For Hire]],'' starring [[Robert Urich]]. In 1987, he co-starred in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[Werewolf (TV series)|Werewolf]],'' as drifter Janos Skorzeny. In 1988, he guest-starred as "Gideon" in the TV series ''[[Paradise]],'' starring [[Lee Horsley]].

[[File:Chuck Connors and son 1959.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Connors and son, Jeffrey, on ''[[The Rifleman]]'' set in 1959. Jeffrey had a role as Toby Halperin in the episode "Tension".]]
Connors was married three times. He met his first wife, Elizabeth Jane Riddell Connors, at one of his baseball games, and married her on October 1, 1948. They had four sons, Michael (born 1950), Jeffrey (1952-2014),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourchuckconnors.com|title=OurChuckConnors.com|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref> Steven (born 1953), Kevin (1956–2005), but divorced in 1961.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

Connors married [[Kamala Devi (actress)|Kamala Devi]] (1963) the year after, co-starring with her in ''[[Geronimo (1962 film)|Geronimo]]''. She also acted with Connors in ''[[Branded (TV series)|Branded]]'', ''Broken Sabre'', and ''[[Cowboy in Africa]]''. They were divorced in 1973. 

Connors played in ''[[Soylent Green]]'' (1973), as Tab Fielding, and Faith Quabius  played an attendant. They were married in 1977 and divorced in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riflemanconnors.com/Chuck_Connors2.htm|title=Chuck Connors profile at|publisher=Riflemanconnors.com|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>

Connors was a supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and attended several fundraisers for campaigns for U.S. President [[Richard M. Nixon]].{{cn|date=April 2015}}

[[File:General Secretary Brezhnev meets actor Chuck Connors, at San Clemente - NARA - 194526 - edited.jpg|thumb|upright|General Secretary Brezhnev meets actor Chuck Connors, 1973]]
Connors was introduced to [[Leonid Brezhnev|Secretary General Leonid Brezhnev]] of the former [[Soviet Union]] at a party given by Nixon at the [[Western White House]] in [[San Clemente, California]], in June 1973. Connors presented Brezhnev with a pair of Colt Single Action Army "Six-Shooters" (revolvers) which Brezhnev liked greatly. Upon boarding his airplane bound for Moscow, Brezhnev noticed Connors in the crowd and went back to him to shake hands, and jokingly jumped up into Connors' towering hug. The ''Rifleman'' was one of the few American shows allowed on Russian television at that time; that was because it was Brezhnev's favorite. Connors and Brezhnev got along so well that Connors traveled to the Soviet Union in December 1973. In 1982, Connors expressed an interest in traveling to the Soviet Union for Brezhnev's funeral, but the U.S. government would not allow him to be part of the official delegation. Coincidentally, Connors and Brezhnev died on the same day, ten years apart.

===Charity===
Connors hosted the annual ''Chuck Connors Charitable Invitational Golf Tournament'', through the Chuck Connors Charitable Foundation, at the Canyon Country Club in Palm Springs, California. Proceeds went directly to the ''Angel View Crippled Children's Foundation'' and over $400,000.00 was raised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palmspringslife.com/Palm-Springs-Life/Cover-Archive/index.php/name/Palm-Springs-Life-Cover-Archive-1970-May/record/1819/ |title=Chuck Connors Charitable Invitational Golf Tournament |deadurl=no |accessdate=November 4, 2013}}</ref>

===Death===
Connors had started smoking in 1940. For many years he smoked three packs of Camel cigarettes a day until he quit the habit in the mid-1970s, though he occasionally resumed smoking afterwards. He died on November 10, 1992 at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles at the age of 71 of [[pneumonia]] stemming from [[lung cancer]].
