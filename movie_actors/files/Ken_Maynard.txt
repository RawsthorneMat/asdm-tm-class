'''Kenneth Olin "Ken" Maynard''' (July 21, 1895 &ndash; March 23, 1973) was an American [[motion picture]] [[stunt]]man and [[actor]].

==Biography==
Maynard was born in [[Vevay, Indiana]], one of five children, another of whom, his [[lookalike]] younger brother, [[Kermit Maynard|Kermit]], would also become an actor; most audience members assumed that Kermit was his brother's identical twin.  Ken Maynard began working at [[Traveling carnival|carnival]]s and [[circus]]es, where he became an accomplished horseman. As a young man, he performed in [[rodeo]]s and was a trick rider with ''[[Buffalo Bill]]'s [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show|Wild West Show]]''.

Maynard served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War I]]. After the war, Maynard returned to show business as a circus rider with [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus|Ringling Brothers]]. When the circus was playing in [[Los Angeles, California]], actor [[Buck Jones]] encouraged Maynard to try working in the movies. Maynard soon had a contract with [[Fox Studios]].<ref name=cowboy>Phillips, Robert W. ''Singing Cowboy Stars''. Salt Lake City: Gibbs-Smith, 1994. pp 14-16.</ref>

He first appeared in [[silent film|silent motion pictures]] in 1923. Maynard's work included [[stunt| stunt performance]]. His horsemanship and rugged good looks made Maynard a cowboy star. He and his white [[stallion (horse)|stallion]], "Tarzan," became famous. His  two recorded songs with [[Columbia Records]], "The Lone Star Trail" and "The Cowboy's Lament," made him one of the first of the [[singing cowboy]]s. Maynard moved to [[Universal Studios]], where he made his first films with a musical soundtrack. He sang two songs in ''[[Sons of the Saddle]]'' in 1930.<ref name=cowboy/>

In 1931 and 1932, Maynard worked for [[Tiffany Productions]] and [[Sono Art-World Wide Pictures]] before moving back to Universal in 1933. Maynard played several musical instruments, and was featured that year on the [[fiddle|violin]] in ''[[The Fiddlin' Buckaroo]]'',  and on the [[banjo]] in ''[[The Trail Drive]]''. Maynard moved to [[Mascot Pictures]] in 1934.<ref name=cowboy/>

Maynard appeared in more than ninety films in twenty years with his white cowboy hat, fancy shirt, and a pair of [[Cowboy action shooting|six-shooters]], but [[alcoholism]] so severely affected his life that his acting career ended in 1944. He made appearances at [[state fair]]s and rodeos. He owned a small circus operation featuring rodeo riders but eventually lost it to creditors. His substantial wealth had vanished, and he lived a desolate life in a rundown [[mobile home|trailer]]. During these years, Maynard was supported by an unknown benefactor, long thought to be [[Gene Autry]].<ref>''Singing In The Saddle'', by Ranger Douglas B. Green. ISBN 0-8265-1506-1</ref> More than twenty five years after his last starring role, Maynard returned to the screen two small roles, in 1970 and 1972, the more notably in ''[[The Marshal of Windy Hollow]]''.

==Death==
Maynard died of [[stomach cancer]] in 1973 at the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture Home]] in [[Woodland Hills, California]]. He was interred at Forest Lawn Cypress Cemetery [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=3056] in [[Cypress, California]].  Maynard's funeral is described in detail in James Horwitz's book ''[[They Went Thataway]]''.<ref>Horwitz, James. ''They Went Thataway'' (1978). Ballantine Books; . ISBN 0-345-27126-2</ref>

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Ken Maynard has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6751 Hollywood Blvd.
