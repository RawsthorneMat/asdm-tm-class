'''Roman Polanski''' (born '''Rajmund Roman Thierry Polański'''; 18&nbsp;August 1933) is a [[Poles|Polish]] and, since 1976, naturalized-French<ref>{{cite web |author= [[AllMovie|All Movie Guide]] |url= http://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/106743/Roman-Polanski/biography |title= Roman Polanski – Biography |website= [[The New York Times]] website |accessdate= 20 November 2013}}</ref> film director, producer, writer, and actor.

Born in Paris to Polish parents, he moved with his family back to Poland ([[Second Polish Republic]]) in 1937, shortly before the outbreak of [[World War II]].<ref name="contributions"/> He survived the [[Nazi Holocaust|Holocaust]], was educated in Poland ([[People's Republic of Poland]]), and became a director of both [[art house]] and commercial films.<ref name="Law in Action: Polanski Libel Case" /> Polanski's first feature-length film, ''[[Knife in the Water]]'' (1962), made in Poland, was nominated for a United States [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] but was beaten by [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]''.<ref name="california"/> He has since received five more [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations, along with two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|Baftas]], four [[César Award|Césars]], a [[Golden Globe]] Award and the [[Palme d'Or]] of the Cannes Film Festival in France. In the United Kingdom he directed three films, beginning with ''[[Repulsion]]'' (1965). In 1968 he moved to the United States and cemented his status by directing the horror film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), for which [[Ruth Gordon]] won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress.

In 1969, Polanski's pregnant wife, [[Sharon Tate]], was murdered by members of the [[Manson Family]] while staying at Polanski's [[Benedict Canyon]] home above Los Angeles.<ref name="Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" /> Following Tate's death, Polanski returned to Europe and spent much of his time in Paris and [[Gstaad]], but did not direct another film until ''[[Macbeth (1971 film)|Macbeth]]'' (1971) in England. The following year he went to Italy to make ''[[What? (film)|What?]]'' (1973) and subsequently spent the next five years living near Rome. However, he travelled to Hollywood to direct ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974). The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, and was a critical and box-office success.<ref name="Chinatown1974 at IMDB" /> Polanski's next film, ''[[The Tenant]]'' (1976), was shot in France, and completed the "Apartment Trilogy", following ''Repulsion'' and ''Rosemary's Baby''.<ref name="trilogy" />

In 1977, after a photo shoot in Los Angeles, [[Roman Polanski sexual abuse case|Polanski was arrested for the rape of a 13-year-old girl]] and pleaded guilty to the charge of [[unlawful sex with a minor]].<ref name="In Polanski Case, '70s Culture Collides With Today" /> To avoid [[sentence (law)|sentencing]], Polanski fled to his home in London, eventually settling in France. More than 32 years later, in September 2009, he was temporarily arrested by Swiss police at the request of United States authorities, who unsuccessfully asked for his [[extradition]].<ref name="CNN270909" /><ref name="A Tribute to&nbsp;... Roman Polanski" /><ref name="guardian.co.uk" /> During an interview for a later film documentary, he offered his apology to the woman,<ref name="CNN-apology" /> and later said that he had regretted that episode for the last 33 years.<ref name="heraldsun" />

Polanski continued to make films such as ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (2002), a WWII true story drama about [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish-Polish]] musician [[Władysław Szpilman]]. The film won three Academy Awards including [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], along with numerous international awards. He also directed other films, including ''[[Oliver Twist (2005 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (2005), a story which parallels his own life as a "young boy attempting to triumph over adversity".<ref name="Freer" /> In 2009 at age 76 he was due to be awarded a lifetime-achievement award at the [[Zurich Film Festival]] but was arrested and held in a detention center for 67 days upon arrival in [[Zurich]] by the authorities in Switzerland at the request of United States authorities.<ref name="AFP2009-09-27" />  After posting $4.5 million bail, he was allowed to live at his chalet in Zurich under house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor, for nine months after which he was freed.<ref name=toobin>{{cite web|last=Toobin|first=Jeffrey|title=The Celebrity Defense Sex, fame, and the case of Roman Polanski|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/14/091214fa_fact_toobin?currentPage=all|date=December 14, 2009|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref> Due to Polanski's arrest, post-production for the film he was working on,  ''[[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]]'', was briefly put on hold, but he resumed and completed work during house arrest at his Swiss villa.

== Early life ==
Polanski was born as '''Rajmund Roman Thierry Polański''' <!-- correct as is, keep reading -->in Paris, France on 18 August 1933,<ref>{{cite news|title=Monitor|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=August 2012|issue=1220/1221|page=28}}</ref> the son of Bula (née Katz-Przedborska)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://znanepary.pl/roman-polanski-i-emmanuelle-seigner/ |title=Roman Polański i Emmanuelle Seigner |publisher=Znane Pary |date=26 December 2012 |accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref> and Ryszard Polański,<ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /> a painter and manufacturer of sculptures, who had changed his family name from Liebling.<ref name="Roman Polanski Biography" /> His mother had a daughter, Annette, by her previous husband. Annette managed to survive [[Auschwitz]], where her mother died, and left Poland forever for France.<ref name="Biography" /> Polański's Polish-born father was [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish]]; Polański's Russian-born mother had been raised Roman Catholic, and was of half Jewish ancestry.<ref name="Guardian profile" /><ref name="Roman Polanski, UXL Newsmakers, Find Articles at BNET.com" /><ref name="polanski"/><!-- Thus Roman Polanski was born as Rajmund Roman Thierry Polański, ''not'' Rajmund Roman Thierry Liebling a year later in 1933 --> Polański's parents were both agnostics.<ref name="adherents"/> Polański, influenced by his education in the [[People's Republic of Poland]], said "I'm an atheist" in an interview about his film, ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cronin|first=Paul |title=Roman Polanski: Interviews|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=1578067995|page=17}}</ref>

=== World War II ===
The Polański family moved back to the Polish city of [[Kraków]] in 1936,<ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /> and were living there when World War&nbsp;II began with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]].  [[General Government|Kraków was soon occupied]] by the German forces, and Nazi racial [[Nuremberg Laws|purity laws]] made the Polańskis targets of persecution, forcing them into the [[Kraków Ghetto]], along with thousands of the [[Holocaust in Poland|city's Jews]].<ref name="Kraków Ghetto&nbsp;– Kraków Informer Travel Guide," /> Around the age of five, he attended primary school for only a few weeks, until "all the Jewish children were abruptly expelled," writes biographer Christopher Sandford. That initiative was soon followed by requiring all Jewish children over the age of twelve to wear white armbands with a blue [[Star of David]] imprinted for visual identification. After he was expelled, he would not be allowed to enter another classroom for the next six years.<ref name="RPinterviewsxv" />{{rp|18}}<ref name="fail">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=UkMRxv820VwC&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22hadn%27t+intended+to+give+refuge%22 |title=Roman |publisher=Morrow (''ibidem'') |year=1984 |page=93 |author=Roman Polański |isbn=0688026214}}</ref> Polanski then witnessed both the ghettoization of Kraków's Jews into a compact area of the city, and the subsequent deportation of all the ghetto's Jews to concentration camps, including watching as his father was taken away. He remembers from age six, one of his first experiences of the terrors to follow:
{{Quote|I had just been visiting my grandmother&nbsp;... when I received a foretaste of things to come. At first I didn't know what was happening. I simply saw people scattering in all directions. Then I realized why the street had emptied so quickly. Some women were being herded along it by German soldiers. Instead of running away like the rest, I felt compelled to watch.

One older woman at the rear of the column couldn't keep up. A German officer kept prodding her back into line, but she fell down on all fours,&nbsp;... Suddenly a pistol appeared in the officer's hand. There was a loud bang, and blood came welling out of her back. I ran straight into the nearest building, squeezed into a smelly recess beneath some wooden stairs, and didn't come out for hours. I developed a strange habit: clenching my fists so hard that my palms became permanently calloused. I also woke up one morning to find that I had wet my bed.<ref name="polanski" />
}}

His father was transferred, along with thousands of other Jews, to [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], a group of 49 German concentration camps in Austria. His mother was taken to Auschwitz and was killed soon after arriving. The forced exodus took place immediately after the German liquidation of the Kraków ghetto, a true-life backdrop to Polanski's film, [[The Pianist (2002 film)|''The Pianist'']] (2002). Polanski, who was then hiding from the Germans, remembered seeing his father being marched off with a long line of people. Polanski tried getting closer to his father to ask him what was happening, and managed to get within a few yards. His father saw him, but afraid his son might be spotted by the German soldiers, whispered (in Polish), "Get lost!"<ref name="RPinterviewsxv" />{{rp|24}} Polański escaped the Kraków Ghetto in 1943 and survived by assuming the name Romek Wilk, with the [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|help]] of some Polish Roman Catholic families including Mrs Sermak who promised his father to shelter him.<ref name="RPinterviewsxv" />{{rp|21}} He attended church, learned to recite Catholic prayers by heart, and behaved outwardly as a Roman Catholic, although he was never baptized. His efforts to blend into a Catholic household failed miserably at least once, when the parish priest visiting the family posed questions to him one-on-one about the [[catechism]]: "You aren't one of us", he said.<ref name="Roman73 snippet">{{cite book | url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=UkMRxv820VwC&q=%22Black+Virgin+of+Czestochowa+above+my+desk%22&dq=%22Black+Virgin+of+Czestochowa+above+my+desk%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FTQBU-CyI5PpoATJiIDACg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA | title=Roman | publisher=Morrow (ibidem) |year=1984 |page=73 |author=Roman Polański |isbn=0688026214}}</ref>

As he roamed the countryside trying to survive in a Poland now occupied by German troops, he witnessed many horrors, such as being "forced to take part in a cruel and sadistic game in which German soldiers took shots at him for target practice."<ref name="Freer" /> Author [[Ian Freer]] concludes that his constant childhood fears and dread of violence have contributed to the "tangible atmospheres he conjures up on film."<ref name="Freer" />

By the time the war ended in 1945, a [[Poland#World War II|fifth of the Polish population]] had been killed,<ref name="countrystudies" /> with the vast majority of the victims being civilians. Of those deaths, 3 million were of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]], 90% of the country's [[The Holocaust#By country|Jewish population]].<ref name="holocaust" /> According to Sandford, Polanski would use the memory of his mother, her dress and makeup style, as a physical model for [[Faye Dunaway]]'s character in his film [[Chinatown (1974 film)|''Chinatown'']] (1974).<ref name="RPinterviewsxv" />{{rp|13}}

=== After the war ===
After the war he was reunited with his father and moved back to Kraków. His father remarried 21 December 1946 to Wanda Zajączkowska (a woman Polanski had never liked) and died of cancer in 1984. Time repaired the family contacts; Polanski visited them in Kraków, and relatives visited him in Hollywood and Paris. Polanski recalls the villages and families he lived with as relatively primitive by European standards:
{{Quote|They were really simple Catholic peasants. This Polish village was like the English village in ''Tess.'' Very primitive. No electricity. The kids with whom I lived didn't know about electricity&nbsp;... they wouldn't believe me when I told them it was enough to turn on a switch!<ref name="RS" />
}}

He stated that "you must live in a Communist country to really understand how bad it can be. Then you will appreciate capitalism."<ref name="RS" /> He also remembered events at the war's end and his reintroduction to mainstream society when he was 12, forming friendships with other children, such as [[Roma Ligocka]], [[Ryszard Horowitz]] and his family.<ref name="polanski1" />

=== Introduction to movies ===
Polanski's fascination with cinema began very early, when he was around age four or five. He recalls this period in an interview:
{{Quote|Even as a child, I always loved cinema and was thrilled when my parents would take me before the war. Then we were put into the ghetto in Krakòw and there was no cinema, but the Germans often showed newsreels to the people outside the ghetto, on a screen in the market place. And there was one particular corner where you could see the screen through the barbed wire. I remember watching with fascination, although all they were showing was the German army and German tanks, with occasional anti-Jewish slogans inserted on cards.<ref name="playboy"/>
}}

After the war, he watched films, either at school or at a local cinema, using whatever pocket money he had. Polanski writes, "Most of this went on the movies, but movie seats were dirt cheap, so a little went a long way. I lapped up every kind of film."<ref name="polanski2" /> As time went on, movies became more than an escape into entertainment, as he explains:
{{Quote|Movies were becoming an absolute obsession with me. I was enthralled by everything connected with the cinema&nbsp;— not just the movies themselves but the aura that surrounded them. I loved the luminous rectangle of the screen, the sight of the beam slicing through the darkness from the projection booth, the miraculous synchronization of sound and vision, even the dusty smell of the tip-up seats. More than anything else though, I was fascinated by the actual mechanics of the process.<ref name="polanski3" />
}}

== Early career in Poland ==
[[File:Roman Polanski gwiazda Lodz.jpg|thumb|Polanski's star on the [[Łódź]] walk of fame]]

Polanski attended the [[National Film School in Łódź]], the third-largest city in Poland.<ref name="Łódź"/> In the 1950s Polanski took up acting, appearing in [[Andrzej Wajda]]'s ''[[Pokolenie]]'' (''A Generation'', 1954) and in the same year in Silik Sternfeld's ''[[Zaczarowany rower]]'' (''Enchanted Bicycle'' or ''Magical Bicycle''). Polanski's directorial debut was also in 1955 with a short film ''Rower'' (''Bicycle''). ''Rower'' is a semi-autobiographical feature film, believed to be lost, which also starred Polanski. It refers to his real-life violent altercation with a notorious Kraków felon, Janusz Dziuba, who arranged to sell Polanski a bicycle, but instead beat him badly and stole his money. In real life the offender was arrested while fleeing after fracturing Polanski's skull, and executed for three murders, out of eight prior such assaults which he had committed.<ref name="thesmokinggun" /> Several other short films made during his study at Łódź gained him considerable recognition, particularly ''[[Two Men and a Wardrobe]]'' (1958) and ''[[When Angels Fall]]'' (1959). He graduated in 1959.<ref name="Łódź" />

== Film director ==
=== 1960s ===
; ''Knife in the Water'' (1962)
Polanski's first feature-length film, ''[[Knife in the Water (film)|Knife in the Water]]'', was also one of the first significant Polish films after the Second World War that did not have a war theme. Scripted by  [[Jerzy Skolimowski]], [[Jakub Goldberg]], and Polanski,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,102030,7114095,Spieprzaj_do_Hollywood_.html |title=Polanski and the writing of "Knife in the Water" |publisher=Wyborcza.pl |accessdate=2014-07-19}}</ref> ''Knife in the Water'' is about a wealthy, unhappily married couple who decide to take a mysterious hitchhiker with them on a weekend boating excursion. A dark and unsettling work, Polanski's debut feature subtly evinces a profound pessimism about human relationships with regard to the psychological dynamics and moral consequences of status envy and sexual jealousy. ''Knife in the Water'' was a major commercial success in the West and gave Polanski an international reputation. The film also earned its director his first Academy Award nomination (Best Foreign Language Film) in 1963. Leon Niemczyk, who played Andrzej, was the only professional actor in the film. Jolanta Umecka, who played Krystyna, was discovered by Polanski at a swimming pool.<ref name="california1"/>

Polanski left then-communist Poland and moved to France, where he had already made two notable short films in 1961: ''[[The Fat and the Lean]]'' and ''[[Ssaki|Mammals]]''. While in France, Polanski contributed one segment ("La rivière de diamants") to the French-produced omnibus film, ''[[Les plus belles escroqueries du monde]]'' (English title: ''The Beautiful Swindlers'') in 1964. However, Polanski found that in the early 1960s the French film industry was xenophobic and generally unwilling to support a rising filmmaker of foreign origin.<ref name="mississippi"/>

; ''Repulsion'' (1965)
Polanski made three feature films in England, based on original scripts written by himself and [[Gérard Brach]], a frequent collaborator. ''[[Repulsion]]'' (1965) is a psychological horror film focusing on a young [[Belgians|Belgian]] woman named Carol ([[Catherine Deneuve]]), who is living in London with her older sister ([[Yvonne Furneaux]]). The film's themes, situations, visual motifs, and effects clearly reflect the influence of early [[surrealist]] cinema as well as horror movies of the 1950s&nbsp;— particularly [[Luis Buñuel]]'s ''[[Un chien Andalou]]'', [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[The Blood of a Poet]]'', [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]]'s ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Diabolique]]'' and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.

; ''Cul-de-sac'' (1966)
''[[Cul-de-sac (1966 film)|Cul-de-sac]]'' (1966) is a bleak [[nihilism|nihilist]] [[tragicomedy]] filmed on location in [[Northumberland]]. The tone and premise of the film owe a great deal to [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', along with aspects of [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]''.

; ''The Fearless Vampire Killers/Dance of the Vampires'' (1967)
''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'' (1967) (known by its original title, "Dance of the Vampires" in most countries outside the United States) is a parody of vampire films. The plot concerns a buffoonish professor and his clumsy assistant, Alfred (played by Polanski), who are traveling through [[Transylvania]] in search of vampires. The ironic and macabre ending is considered classic Polanski. ''The Fearless Vampire Killers'' was Polanski's first feature to be photographed in color with the use of [[Panavision]] lenses, and included a striking visual style with snow-covered, fairy-tale landscapes, similar to the work of Soviet fantasy filmmakers. In addition, the richly textured color schemes of the settings evoke the magical, kaleidoscopic paintings of the great Belarussian-Jewish artist [[Marc Chagall]], who provides the namesake for the innkeeper in the film. The film was written for [[Jack MacGowran]], who played the lead role of Professor Abronsius.

Polanski met [[Sharon Tate]] while the film was being made, where she played the role of the local innkeeper's daughter. They were married in London on {{Nowrap|20 January}} 1968.<ref name="polanski4" />

; ''Rosemary's Baby'' (1968)
Paramount studio head [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]] brought Polanski to America ostensibly to direct the film ''Downhill Racer'', but told Polanski that he really wanted to him to read the horror novel ''[[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' by [[Ira Levin]]<ref name="california2"/> to see if a film could be made out of it.<ref name="christopher"/> Polanski read it non-stop through the night and the following morning decided he wanted to write as well as direct it. He wrote the 272-page screenplay for the film in slightly longer than three weeks.<ref name="christopher3"/> The film, ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), was a box-office success and became his first Hollywood production, thereby establishing his reputation as a major commercial filmmaker. The film, a horror-thriller set in trendy Manhattan, is about Rosemary Woodhouse ([[Mia Farrow]]),<ref name="publishing4"/> a young housewife who is impregnated by the devil. Polanski's screenplay adaptation earned him a second Academy Award nomination.

On 9 August 1969, while Polanski was working in London, his wife, Sharon Tate, and four other people were murdered at the Polanskis' residence in Los Angeles.<ref name="bugliosi" />

=== 1970s ===
; ''Macbeth'' (1971)
Polanski adapted ''[[Macbeth]]'' into a screenplay with the [[Shakespeare]] expert [[Kenneth Tynan]].<ref name="publishing5"/> [[Jon Finch]] and [[Francesca Annis]] played the main characters.<ref name="Bate, Jonath page 132"/> [[Hugh Hefner]] and Playboy Productions funded [[Macbeth (1971 film)|the 1971 film]], which opened in New York and was screened in Playboy Theater.<ref name="california6"/> Hefner was credited as executive producer, and the film was listed as a "Playboy Production".<ref name="shakespeare"/> It was controversial because of Lady Macbeth's being nude in a scene,<ref name="Bate, Jonath page 132" /> and received an X rating because of its graphic violence and nudity.<ref name="shakespeare7"/> In his autobiography, Polanski wrote that he wanted to be true to the violent nature of the work, and that he had been aware that his first project following Tate's murder, would be subject to scrutiny and probable criticism regardless of the subject matter; if he had made a comedy he would have been perceived as callous.<ref name="polanski5" />

; ''What?'' (1973)
Written by Polanski and previous collaborator [[Gérard Brach]], ''[[What? (film)|What?]]'' (1973) is a mordant [[absurdist fiction|absurdist]] comedy loosely based on the themes of ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' and [[Henry James]]. The film is a rambling [[shaggy dog story]] about the sexual indignities that befall a winsome young American [[hippie]] woman hitchhiking through Europe.

; ''Chinatown'' (1974)
Polanski returned to Hollywood in 1973 to direct ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974) for [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film is widely considered to be one of the finest American crime movies<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/bfi-film-releases/chinatown| title=Chinatown| accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref> and was nominated for 11 Academy Awards. The stars, [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Faye Dunaway]], both received Oscar nominations, and the script by [[Robert Towne]] won for Best Original Screenplay.<ref name="Chinatown1974 at IMDB" /> Polanski appears in a cameo role.

; ''The Tenant'' (1976)
Polanski returned to Paris for his next film, ''[[The Tenant]]'' (1976), which was based on a 1964 novel by [[Roland Topor]], a French writer of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish origin]]. In addition to directing the film, Polanski also played a leading role of a timid Polish immigrant living in Paris. Together with ''Repulsion'' and ''Rosemary's Baby'', ''The Tenant'' can be seen as the third installment in a loose trilogy of films called the "Apartment Trilogy" that explore the themes of social alienation and psychic and emotional breakdown.<ref name="trilogy" />

In 1978, Polanski [[#Sexual abuse case|became a fugitive]] from American justice and could no longer work in countries where he might face arrest or extradition.

; ''Tess'' (1979)
He dedicated his next film, ''[[Tess (1979 film)|Tess]]'' (1979), to the memory of his late wife, Sharon Tate. It was Tate who suggested to Polanski that he read ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', as she felt it might make a good film. [[Nastassja Kinski]] appeared in the title role opposite [[Peter Firth]] and [[Leigh Lawson]].

''Tess'' was shot in the north of France instead of Hardy's England and became the most expensive film made in France up to that time. Ultimately, it proved a financial success and was well received by both critics and the public. Polanski won France's César Awards for [[César Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[César Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and received his fourth Academy Award nomination (and his second nomination for Best Director). The film received three Oscars: best cinematography, best art direction, best costume design, and was nominated for best picture.

=== 1980s ===

; ''Pirates'' (1986)
Nearly seven years passed before Polanski's next film, ''[[Pirates (1986 film)|Pirates]]'', a lavish period piece starring [[Walter Matthau]] as Captain Red, which the director intended as an homage to the beloved [[Errol Flynn]] swashbucklers of his childhood. Captain Red's henchman, Jean Baptiste, was played by Cris Campion. The film is about a rebellion the two lead on a ship called the ''Neptune'', in the seventeenth century. The screenplay was written by Polanski, Gérard Brach, and John Brownjohn. The film was shot on location in Tunisia,<ref name="publishing9"/> using a full sized pirate vessel constructed for the production. It was a financial and critical failure, recovering a small fraction of its production budget and garnering a single Academy Award nomination.<ref name="publishing10"/>

; ''Frantic'' (1988)
''[[Frantic (film)|Frantic]]'' (1988) was a Hitchcockian suspense-thriller starring [[Harrison Ford]]<ref name="publishing11"/> and the actress/model [[Emmanuelle Seigner]],<ref name="publishing12"/> who later became Polanski's wife. The film follows an ordinary tourist in Paris whose wife is kidnapped. He attempts, hopelessly, to go through the Byzantine bureaucratic channels to deal with her disappearance, but finally takes matters into his own hands.

Polanski followed this with the dark psycho-sexual film ''[[Bitter Moon]]'' (1992), followed by a film of the acclaimed play ''[[Death and the Maiden (film)|Death and the Maiden]]'' (1994) starring [[Sigourney Weaver]].

; ''The Ninth Gate'' (1999)
''[[The Ninth Gate]]'' is a thriller based on the novel ''[[El Club Dumas]]'' by [[Arturo Perez-Reverte]] and starring [[Johnny Depp]]. The movie's plot is based on the idea that an ancient text called "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadow", authored by Aristide Torchia along with Lucifer, is the key to raising Satan.<ref name="publishing13"/>

In 1997, Polanski directed a stage version of his 1967 film ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'', which debuted in [[Vienna]]<ref name="bartlomiej"/> followed by successful runs in [[Stuttgart]], Hamburg, Berlin, and [[Budapest]]. On {{Nowrap|11 March}} 1998, Polanski was elected a member of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]].<ref name="Entertainment, Polanski joins French elite" />

=== 2000s ===
[[File:Roman Polanski..jpg|thumb|left|upright|Polanski at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]] for ''The Pianist'']]

; ''The Pianist'' (2002)
In 2001, Polanski filmed ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'', an adaptation of the WWII [[The Pianist (memoir)|autobiography of the same name]] by [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish]] musician [[Władysław Szpilman]]. Szpilman's experiences as a persecuted Jew in Poland during WWII were reminiscent of those of Polanski and his family. While Szpilman and Polanski escaped the concentration camps, their families did not, eventually perishing.

When [[Warsaw, Poland]] was chosen for the 2002 premiere of ''The Pianist'', "the country exploded with pride." According to reports, numerous former communists came to the screening and "agreed that it was a fantastic film."<ref name="worldcrunch" />

In May 2002, the film won the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' (Golden Palm) award at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]],<ref name="cannes-2002.com" /> as well as [[César Awards|Césars]] for [[César Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[Cesar Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and later the 2002 [[Academy Award for Directing]]. Because he would have been arrested in the United States, Polanski did not attend the Academy Awards ceremony in Hollywood. After the announcement of the Best Director Award, Polanski received a standing ovation from most of those present in the theater. Actor [[Harrison Ford]] accepted the award for Polanski, and then presented the Oscar to him at the [[Deauville Film Festival]] five months later in a public ceremony.<ref name="wlwt" /> Polanski later received the [[Crystal Globe]] award for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] in 2004.

; ''Oliver Twist''  (2005)
''[[Oliver Twist (2005 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' is an adaptation of Dickens's classic, written by ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'''s [[Ronald Harwood]] and shot in [[Prague]].<ref name="publishing14"/> Polanski said in interviews that he made the film as something he could show his children, and that the life of the young scavenger mirrored his own life, fending for himself in World War II Poland.

=== 2010s ===
; ''The Ghost Writer'' (2010)
''[[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]]'', a thriller focusing on a ghostwriter working on the memoirs of a character based loosely on former British prime minister [[Tony Blair]], swept the [[European Film Awards]] in 2010, winning six awards, including best movie, director, actor and screenplay.<ref name="Awards1" /> When it premiered at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival|60th Berlinale]] in February 2010, Polanski won a [[Silver Bear for Best Director]],<ref name="historical"/> and in February 2011, it won four [[César Awards]], France's version of the Academy Awards.<ref name="nytimes" />

The film is based on a novel by British writer [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]. Harris and Polanski had previously worked for many months on a film of Harris's earlier novel ''Pompeii'', a novel that was actually inspired by Polanski's ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/polanski-to-bring-bestseller-on-last-days-of-pompeii-to-the-big-screen-434816.html</ref> They had completed a script for ''Pompeii'' and were nearing production when the film was cancelled due to a looming actors' strike in September 2007.<ref>http://variety.com/2007/film/news/polanski-pulls-out-of-pompeii-2-1117971777/</ref>  After that film fell apart, they moved on to Harris's novel, [[The Ghost (novel)|The Ghost]], and adapted it for the screen together.

The cast includes [[Ewan McGregor]] as the writer and [[Pierce Brosnan]] as former British Prime Minister Adam Lang. The film was shot on locations in Germany.<ref name="studiobabelsberg" />

In the United States, film critic [[Roger Ebert]] included it in his top 10 pick for 2010, and states that "this movie is the work of a man who knows how to direct a thriller. Smooth, calm, confident, it builds suspense instead of depending on shock and action."<ref name="firstshowing" /> Co-star Ewan McGregor agrees, saying about Polanski that "he's a legend... I've never examined a director and the way that they work, so much before. He's brilliant, just brilliant, and absolutely warrants his reputation as a great director."<ref name="articleslash" />
[[File:Roman Polanski 2011 2.jpg|thumb|At the premiere of ''[[Carnage (2011 film)|Carnage]]'' in Paris, November 2011]]

; ''Carnage'' (2011)
Polanski shot ''[[Carnage (2011 film)|Carnage]]'' in February/March 2011. The film is a screen version of [[Yasmina Reza]]'s play ''[[God of Carnage]]'', a comedy about the relationship between two couples after their children get in a fight at school and the selfishness of everyone, which eventually leads to chaos. It stars [[Kate Winslet]], [[Jodie Foster]], [[Christoph Waltz]] and [[John C. Reilly]]. Though set in New York, it was shot in Paris.<ref name="dailymail" /> The film had its world premiere on 9 September 2011 at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and was released in the United States by Sony Pictures Classics on 16 December 2011.

Co-stars Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet commented about Polanski's directing style. According to Foster, "He has a very, very definitive style about how he likes it done. He decides everything. He decided every lens. Every prop. Everything. It's all him."<ref name="hollywoodchicago" /> Winslet adds that "Roman is one of the most extraordinary men I've ever met. The guy is 77 years old. He has an effervescent quality to him. He's very joyful about his work, which is infectious. He likes to have a small crew, to the point that, when I walked on the set, my thought was, 'My God, this is it?'”<ref name="inquirer" /> Also noting that style of directing, [[New York Film Festival]] director [[Richard Pena]], during the American premiere of the film, called Polanski "a poet of small spaces... in just a couple of rooms he can conjure up an entire world, an entire society."<ref name="latimes" />

; ''Venus in Fur'' (2013)
His latest film is an adaptation of the award-winning play ''[[Venus in Fur (film)|Venus in Fur]]'', starring his wife [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] and [[Mathieu Amalric]].

; ''D'' (2015)
Polanski is currently preparing to shoot ''D'', a film about the notorious [[Dreyfus affair]] in the 19th century, in which one of the few Jewish members of the French Army's general staff was wrongly convicted of passing military secrets to the [[German Empire]] and sent to [[Devil's Island]], only to be acquitted 12 years later. The film is written by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], who is working with Polanski for the third time.<ref name="Roman Polanski to Direct Dreyfus Affair Drama 'D'"/> The film is scheduled to begin production in Warsaw in July, 2015.<ref>http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/prosecutors-in-poland-send-polanski-extradition-request-to-court/?_r=0</ref>

== Marriages and relationships ==
=== Barbara Kwiatkowska-Lass ===
Polanski's first wife, [[Barbara Kwiatkowska-Lass|Barbara Lass]] (née Kwiatkowska),<ref name="RPinterviewsxv" /> was a Polish actress who also starred in Polanski's 1959 ''When Angels Fall''.<ref name="autogenerated" /> The couple were married in 1959 and divorced in 1961.<!-- or 1962 per Bugliosi--><ref name="RPinterviewsxv" />

=== Sharon Tate ===
[[File:Sharon Tate in Eye of the Devil trailer 2.jpg|thumb|left|Sharon Tate in the trailer for the film ''[[Eye of the Devil]]''.]]
Polanski met rising actress [[Sharon Tate]] while filming ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'', and during the production the two of them began dating.<ref name="Bugliosip27" /> On {{Nowrap|20 January}} 1968, Polanski married Tate in London.<ref name="sknew" />

In August 1969, while Polanski was in Europe working on a film, Tate was murdered along with four of their friends at their home in Los Angeles by members of [[Charles Manson]]'s "family," a group of young, gullible, and mostly female followers. Tate was pregnant at the time of her murder.

Manson, along with members of his "family", was arrested in late 1969, and eventually tried and found guilty in 1971 of 27 counts, including first-degree murder, an event now called the [[Tate-LaBianca murders|Manson murders]]. Because at the time it was one of the most "horrific crimes in modern history," the crime and trial of Manson and his followers became a media sensation, leading to movies, documentaries and bestselling books.<ref name="Statman"/>

Polanski has said that his absence on the night of the murders is the greatest regret of his life.<ref name="Roman Polanski: The artful dodger" /> In his autobiography, he wrote, "Sharon's death is the only watershed in my life that really matters", and commented that her murder changed his personality from a "boundless, untroubled sea of expectations and optimism" to one of "ingrained pessimism&nbsp;... eternal dissatisfaction with life".<ref name="polanski7" /> In his autobiography, Polanski described his brief time with Tate as the best years of his life.

Polanski was also left with a very negative impression of the press, which he felt was interested in sensationalizing the lives of the victims, and indirectly himself, to attract readers. He was shocked by the lack of sympathy expressed in various news stories:

{{quote
| I had long known that it was impossible for a journalist to convey 100 percent of the truth, but I didn't realize to what extent the truth is distorted, both by the intentions of the journalist and by neglect. I don't mean just the interpretations of what happened; I also mean the facts. The reporting about Sharon and the murders was virtually criminal. Reading the papers, I could not believe my eyes. I could not believe my eyes! They blamed the victims for their own murders. I really despise the press. I didn't always. The press made me despise it.<ref name="playboy" />
}}

Among the media-generated [[sensationalism]] were rumors that claimed Tate and her visitors were taking drugs, despite the coroner announcing that no traces of drugs or nicotine were found after Tate's autopsy.<ref name="USAToday"/> For years afterward, notes Sandford, "reporters openly speculated about the Polanskis' home life" and their personalities in order to create more media gossip about the private lives of Hollywood celebrities.<ref name="RPinterviewsxv" />{{rp|2}}

=== Nastassja Kinski ===
[[File:Roman Polanski Emmanuelle Seigner Césars 2011.jpg|thumb|Polanski and [[Emmanuelle Seigner]] at the [[César Awards 2011]].]]
In 1976, Polanski started a romantic relationship with [[Nastassja Kinski]], who starred in ''Tess''. She was between 15 and 17 years old at the time and he was 43. Their relationship ended at the completion of filming.<ref name="After 'Tess' and Roman Polanski, Nastassia Kinski Trades Notoriety for L.A.

=== Emmanuelle Seigner ===
In 1989, Polanski married French actress [[Emmanuelle Seigner]], 33 years his junior. They have two children, daughter Morgane and son Elvis.<ref name="WTCIFTC" /> Polanski and his children speak Polish at home.<ref name="tvn24" />

== Legal history ==
=== Sexual abuse case ===
{{main|Roman Polanski sexual abuse case}}

On 11 March 1977, Polanski, then 43 years old, was arrested in Los Angeles for the [[sexual assault]] of 13-year-old Samantha Geimer during a photo shoot for French ''Vogue'' magazine. Polanski was indicted on six counts of criminal behavior, including rape.<ref name="WTCIFTC"/><ref name="BBC2009-09-28"/> At his arraignment he pleaded not guilty to all charges. Many executives in Hollywood came to his defense.<ref name="Polanski Pleads Not Guilty in Drug-Rape Case"/> Geimer's attorney next arranged a [[plea bargain]] in which five of the six charges would be dismissed, and Polanski accepted.<ref name="Romney2008-10-05"/> 

[[File:Roman Polański.jpg|thumb|left|Polanski in 2007.]]
As a result of the plea bargain, Polanski pleaded guilty to the charge of "Unlawful Sexual Intercourse with a minor,"<ref name="onecle"/><ref name="Palmer2009-09-28"/> and was ordered to undergo 90 days of psychiatric evaluation at [[California Institution for Men]] at Chino.<ref name="Court Orders Polanski Kept in Jail"/> Upon release from prison after 42 days, Polanski understood that at the final sentencing he would be put on [[probation]]. However, he learned that the judge was planning to renege on his promise of no further jail time.<ref name="bostonglobe"/><ref name="Palmer2009-09-28"/><ref name="Cieply2009-10-02"/> Polanski's attorney suggested that despite the fact that the prosecuting attorneys recommended probation, "the judge could no longer be trusted..." and the judge's representations were "worthless".<ref name="documentary2"/>

Upon learning of the judge's plans, Polanski fled to France on 1 February 1978, just hours before sentencing.<ref name="Allen2009-10-01"/> As a French [[Citizenship|citizen]], he has been protected from extradition and has lived mostly in France since then.<ref name="Dyer2009-09-29"/> However, having fled the country before final sentencing, the charges were never dismissed and still remain pending.

In an interview with [[Larry King]], Geimer stated that the police and media had been slow at the time of the assault to believe her account, which she attributed to the climate of the era.<ref name="2003 Larry King Transcript"/> In 1988 she sued Polanski. Among other things, the suit alleged sexual assault, [[false imprisonment]], seduction of a minor, and [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]]. In 1993 Polanski agreed to settle with Geimer. In August 1996 Polanski still owed her $604,416; Geimer and her lawyers later {{When|date=May 2015}}confirmed that the settlement was completed.<ref name="2003 Larry King Transcript"/><ref name="Ryan2009-10-03"/>

On 26 September 2009, Polanski was arrested while in Switzerland at the request of United States authorities.<ref name="AFP2009-09-27"/> The arrest brought renewed attention to the case and stirred controversy, particularly in the United States and Europe.<ref name="bostonglobe"/> Polanski was defended by many prominent individuals, including Hollywood celebrities and European artists and politicians, who called for his release.<ref name="outcry"/> American public opinion was reported to run against him, however,<ref name="reaction"/><ref name="Reuters"/> and polls in France and Poland showed that strong majorities favored his [[extradition]] to the United States.<ref name="ft"/><ref name="inpoland"/>

Polanski was jailed near [[Zürich]] for two months, then put under [[house arrest]] at his home in [[Gstaad]] while awaiting decision of appeals fighting extradition.<ref name="Roman Polanski begins house arrest at his Swiss chalet"/> On 12 July 2010 the Swiss rejected the United States request, declared him a "free man" and released him from custody.<ref name="nytimes1"/> He remains the subject of an [[Interpol notice|Interpol red notice]] issued in 2005 at the request of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/Wanted-Persons/(wanted_id)/2005-47995|title=Wanted Persons: Polanski, Roman Raymond|author=Staff|year=2005|publisher=[[Interpol]]|accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref>

During a television interview on 10 March 2011, Geimer blamed the media, reporters, the court, and the judge for causing "way more damage to [her] and [her] family than anything Roman Polanski has ever done", and opined that the judge was using her and Polanski for the media exposure.<ref name="2003 Larry King Transcript"/><ref name="abcnews"/>

In January 2014, newly uncovered emails by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge {{who|date=May 2015}} from 2008, indicated that if Polanski returned to the United States for a hearing, the conduct of the judge who had originally presided over the case might require that Polanski be freed. These emails were related to a 2008 documentary film by Marina Zenovich.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/movies/emails-raising-questions-about-the-polanski-case.html?_r=0 "Emails Raising Questions About the Polanski Case"], ''New York Times'', 15 January 2014.</ref><ref name=Beaumont-Thomas>{{cite news|last=Beaumont-Thomas|first=Ben|title=Conduct of judge in Roman Polanski statutory rape case questioned|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/17/judge-roman-polanski-rape-case-questioned|accessdate=19 April 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 January 2014}}</ref> In late October 2014, Polanski was questioned by prosecutors in Kraków.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29834442 Roman Polanski freed in Poland]</ref>

====Documentary films====
In 2008 the documentary film by Marina Zenovich, ''[[Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired]]'', was released in Europe and the United States where it won numerous awards.<ref name="nytimes8" /> The film focuses on the judge in the case and the possible reasons why he changed his mind. It includes interviews with people involved in the case, including the victim, Geimer, and the prosecutor, Roger Gunson. Geimer said that the judge "didn't care what happened" to her or Polanski, but "was orchestrating some little show,"<ref name="documentary2" /> while Gunson added, "I'm not surprised that Polanski left under those circumstances,&nbsp;... it was going to be a real circus."<ref name="documentary2" /><ref name="documentary1"/>

Former DA David Wells, whose statements were the most damning against Polanski, and who said he advised the judge to imprison Polanski, admitted that he lied about those statements, and said that to the press to "play up" his own role.<ref name="Former DA admits he lied in 'Roman Polanski: Wanted And Desired' film" /><ref name="Ex-prosecutor admits he lied about Polanski case" />

In December 2009, a California appellate court discussed the film's allegations as it denied Polanski's request to have the case dismissed. While saying they  "deeply concerned" the court, and were "in many cases supported by considerable evidence," it also found that “(e)ven in light of our fundamental concern about the misconduct&nbsp;... flight was not Polanski’s only option. It was not even his best option." It said dismissal of the case, which would erase Polanski's guilty plea, wouldn't be an "appropriate result," and that he still had other legal options.<ref name="bostonglobe" /><ref name="cbsnews" />

In September 2011, the documentary film ''[[Roman Polanski: A Film Memoir]]'' had its world premiere in Zürich, Switzerland. During an interview in the film, he offers his apology to Geimer: "She is a double victim: My victim, and a victim of the press."<ref name="CNN-apology" /> On this occasion, he collected the lifetime achievement award he was to receive at the time of his arrest two years earlier.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/sep/28/roman-polanski-zurich-film-festival Roman Polanski gets Zürich film festival award after two-year wait], ''The Guardian'', 28 September 2011</ref>

=== ''Vanity Fair'' libel case ===
In 2004, Polanski sued ''[[Vanity Fair magazine|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine in London for libel. A 2002 article in the magazine claimed that Polanski promised he would "make another Sharon Tate out of you" in an attempt to seduce a Scandinavian model while he was travelling to Tate's funeral. He received supporting testimony from Mia Farrow, and ''Vanity Fair'' "was unable to prove that the incident occurred." Polanski was awarded [[pound sterling|£]]50,000 in [[damages]] plus some of his [[legal costs]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=F30715F93F5B0C708EDDAE0894DD404482| title=Polanski Wins Vanity Fair Libel Suit| accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref>
