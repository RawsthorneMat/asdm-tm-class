She was born '''Virginia Pound''' in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. 

Before appearing in films, Gray sang with a group in Cleveland called Ben Yost's Varsity Coeds, who performed primarily in movie theaters before the movie began. Although she had a film test at [[Universal Studios]] and a brief contract with [[Paramount Pictures]], she made her first big film for [[Columbia Pictures]].

As a Columbia contract player she appeared in the studio's shorts and serials, including ''[[Flying G-Men]]'' (starring [[Robert Paige]]), ''[[Pest from the West]]'' (starring [[Buster Keaton]]), and ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]'' (starring [[The Three Stooges]]). When her Columbia contract lapsed, she found work at [[Monogram Pictures]], where she worked with action star [[Frankie Darro]].<ref name="AB">{{cite web | url=http://www.republicpictures75th.com/celebs/bios/booth/bio2_adrianbooth.html | title=Adrian Booth biography | publisher=Republic Pictures 75th | accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>

Gray also starred opposite [[John Wayne]] in ''[[Red River Range]]'' (1938) and appeared in the title role in ''[[O, My Darling Clementine]]'' (1943), a [[country music]] film starring [[Roy Acuff]] as a [[singing cowboy|singing sheriff]].<ref name="LG">{{cite web | url=http://www.b-westerns.com/ladies28.htm | title=Lorna Gray/Adrian Booth | publisher=B-Westerns | accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>

In her Paramount films, such as ''[[Hold 'Em Navy]]'', she was credited as Virginia Pound, but she was given the name '''Lorna Gray''' by Columbia and she used it from 1938 until 1945, when she left Columbia and moved to [[Republic Pictures]]. She appeared as Lorna Gray in Republic's ''[[Federal Operator 99]]'', but subsequently adopted the name '''Adrian Booth''', which she has used ever since.<ref name="Bloodshot">[http://blogs.commercialappeal.com/beifuss/archives/2007/06/adrian_booth.html "Yo, Adrian!
