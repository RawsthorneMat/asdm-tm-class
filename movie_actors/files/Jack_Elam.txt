</ref>&nbsp;– October 20, 2003), was an [[United States|American]] [[film]] and [[television]] [[actor]] best known for his numerous roles as villains in [[Western (genre)|Western films]] and, later in his career, comedies (sometimes spoofing his villainous image). His most distinguishing physical quality was the iris of his left eye, which was skewed to the outside, making him look unnaturally "wide eyed" (the opposite of cross-eyed). Before his career in acting, he took several jobs in finance and served two years in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]].

Elam played in 73 movies, and made an appearance in 41 television series. His most known works consist of ''[[Once Upon A Time In The West]]'', ''[[High Noon]]'' and the television program, ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

Jack Elam died in 2003 of [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]], leaving behind two daughters and one son.

==Early life==
Elam was born in [[Miami, Arizona|Miami]] in [[Gila County, Arizona|Gila County]] in south central [[Arizona]], to Millard Elam and Alice Amelia Kirby. His mother died in 1922 when Jack was two years old.<ref name="westernclippings" /> By 1930, he was living with his father, older sister Mildred, and their stepmother, Flossie Varney Elam.

He grew up picking [[cotton]] and lost the sight in his left eye during a boyhood accident when he was stabbed with a pencil at a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] meeting.<ref name=NYTobit>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E2DD1731F930A15753C1A9659C8B63&st=cse&sq=jack+elam&scp=2 |title=Jack Elam, Lazy-Eyed Movie Villain, Is Dead |author=Douglas Martin|publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |date=October 23, 2003|accessdate=2009-11-27}}</ref> He was a student at both [[Miami High School (Arizona)|Miami High School]] in [[Gila County]] and [[Phoenix Union High School]] in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], graduating from there in the late 1930s.

Elam attended [[Santa Monica College|Santa Monica Junior College]] in [[California]]. After that, he worked as a bookkeeper at the Bank of America in Los Angeles and as an auditor for the Standard Oil Company. In [[World War II]], he served two years in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and subsequently became an independent [[accountant]] in [[Hollywood]]; one of his clients was movie mogul [[Samuel Goldwyn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jack-elam-548963.html|title=Jack Elam Archetypal villain in film and TV westerns|author=Paul Wadey|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=October 23, 2003|accessdate=2009-11-27}}</ref> At one time, he was the manager of the [[Bel Air Hotel]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="westernclippings">{{cite web |url=http://www.westernclippings.com/heavies/jackelam_charactersheavies.shtml |title = Jack Elam at westernclippings.com |accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>

==Acting career==
In 1949, Elam made his debut in ''[[She Shoulda Said No!]],'' an [[exploitation film]] where a chorus girl's marijuana smoking ruins her career and drives her brother to suicide. He appeared mostly in westerns and gangster films playing villains. Elam made multiple guest star appearances in many popular Western television series in the 1950s and 1960s, including "[[Gunsmoke]]", "[[The Rifleman]]", "[[Lawman (TV series)]]", "[[Bonanza]]", "[[Cheyenne]]", "[[Have Gun Will Travel]]", "[[Zorro]]", "[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]" and "[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]". In 1961, Elam played a slightly crazed character in an episode of ''The Twilight Zone'' entitled "[[Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?]]."

In 1963, Elam got a rare chance to play the good guy, Deputy Marshal J. D. Smith in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] series, ''[[The Dakotas (TV series)|The Dakotas]],'' a television western that ran for only nineteen episodes.  He played George Taggart, a gunslinger-turned-marshal in the NBC/WB western series, ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|Temple Houston]]'', with [[Jeffrey Hunter]] in the title role. Elam got this part after [[James Coburn]] declined the role; the series ran for only twenty-six weeks.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), p. 106</ref>

In 1968, Elam had an amusing cameo in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', where he was one of a trio of gunslingers sent to kill Charles Bronson's character. Elam spent a good part of the scene trying to trap an annoying fly in his gun barrel. In 1969, he was given his first comedic role in ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', which was followed two years later by ''[[Support Your Local Gunfighter]];'' both were opposite [[James Garner]], after which he found his villainous parts dwindling and his comic roles increasing. (Both films were also directed by [[Burt Kennedy]], who saw Elam's potential as a comedian and would direct him a total of 15 times in features and television.) In between those two films, he also played a comically cranky old coot opposite [[John Wayne]] in [[Howard Hawks]]'s ''[[Rio Lobo]]'' (1970).

In 1979, he was cast--ideally, some said--as the Frankenstein monster in the CBS sitcom ''[[Struck by Lightning (TV series) | Struck by Lightning]]'', but the show was cancelled after only three episodes.

In 1981, Elam played an eccentric doctor in the movie [[The Cannonball Run]] as Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing.

In 1984, Elam once again returned in the sequel [[The Cannonball Run II]]

In 1985, Elam played Charlie in ''[[The Aurora Encounter]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0090675|"The Aurora Encounter" (1986)}}. Retrieved 2009-11-27.</ref> During this film Elam made a lifelong relationship with an 11-year-old boy named Mickey Hays, who suffered from [[progeria]]. As shown in the documentary  ''[[I Am Not A Freak]]''<ref>{{IMDb title|0345421|"I Am Not A Freak" (1987)}}. Retrieved 2009-11-27.</ref> viewers see how close Elam and Hays really were. Elam said, "You know I've met a lot of people, but I've never met anybody that got next to me like Mickey."

In 1986, Elam also co-starred on the short-lived comedy series ''[[Easy Street (TV series)|Easy Street]]'' as Alvin "Bully" Stevenson, the down-on-his-luck uncle of Loni Anderson's character, L. K. McGuire.

In 1988, Elam co-starred with Willie Nelson in the movie "Where The Hell's That Gold?"

In 1994, Elam was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] of the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum.

Elam classified the stages of a moderately successful actor's life, as defined by the way a film director refers to the actor suggested for a part. (He said this on a George Plimpton ABC documentary about the making of ''Rio Lobo;'' [[Ricardo Montalbán]] would later use the recitation numerous times, with his own name, in speeches.<ref>[http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/5521.html "Crowds Gather to Inaugurate Montalbán Theatre"]. www.startrek.com. 5 November 2004.
