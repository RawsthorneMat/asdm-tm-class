'''Warren Mercer Oates''' (July 5, 1928 – April 3, 1982) was an American actor best known for his performances in several films directed by [[Sam Peckinpah]] including ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969) and ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'' (1974). He starred in numerous films during the early 1970s which have since achieved cult status including ''[[The Hired Hand]]'' (1971), ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]'' (1971) and ''[[Race with the Devil]]'' (1975). Oates also portrayed [[John Dillinger]] in the biopic ''[[Dillinger (1973 film)|Dillinger]]'' (1973) and Sergeant Hulka in the comedy ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'' (1981).

==Early life==
Oates was born and reared in [[Depoy, Kentucky|Depoy]], a tiny rural community west of [[Greenville, Kentucky|Greenville]] in [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]]. He was the son of Sarah Alice ([[married and maiden names|née]] Mercer) and Bayless Earle Oates, who owned a [[general store]].<ref>[http://www.tedstrong.com/oateskentuckian.shtml Kentuckian Warren Oates Got His Big Break in 1954]</ref><ref>{{Citation

After high school he enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]] for two years serving in the air wing as an aircraft mechanic. He became interested in theater at the [[University of Louisville]] and starred in several plays there in 1953 for the Little Theater Company. He got an opportunity in New York City to star in a live production of the [[television series]], ''[[Studio One (TV series)|Studio One]]'' in 1957.<ref name=tedstrong>{{cite web |title=Tedstrong, Warren Oates |work=tedstrong.com |url=http://www.tedstrong.com/warrenoates.shtml |year=2002 |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>

==Career==
Oates moved to Los Angeles where he began to establish himself in guest roles in [[western (genre)|Western]] [[television series]], including ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'', ''[[Buckskin (TV series)|Buckskin]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', ''[[Trackdown (TV series)|Trackdown]]'', ''[[Tate (TV series)|Tate]]'', ''[[The Rebel (TV series)|The Rebel]]'', ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'', ''[[Lawman (TV series)|Lawman]]'', ''[[The Big Valley]]'' and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''. Oates first met Peckinpah when he played a variety of guest roles on ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958–1963), a popular television series created by the director. He also played a supporting role in Peckinpah's short-lived series ''[[The Westerner (TV series)|The Westerner]]'' in 1960.<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Weddle|authorlink= David Weddle|title=If They Move...Kill 'Em!|publisher=Grove Press |year = 1994|pages=153–154. ISBN 0-8021-3776-8}}</ref> The collaboration continued as he worked on Peckinpah's early films ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]) and ''[[Major Dundee]]'' ([[1965 in film|1965]]).

"There were forty [western] series, and I went from one to the other. I started out playing the third bad guy on a horse and worked my way up to the No. 1 bad guy," Oates once quipped.<ref name=mph/>

In the episode "Subterranean City" (October 14, 1958) of the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] ''[[Rescue 8]]'', Oates played a gang member, Pete, who is the nephew of series character Skip Johnson ([[Lang Jeffries]]). In the story line, rescuers Skip Johnson and Wes Cameron ([[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]]) search for a lost girl in the sewer tunnels and encounter three criminals hiding out underground. Pete soon breaks with his gang companions and joins the firemen Wes and Skip in locating the missing child.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0890610/|title=Subterranean City, ''Rescue 8'', October 14, 1958 |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref>

In 1961, Oates guest starred in the episode "Artie Moon" in [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Lawless Years]]'' [[crime drama]] about the 1920s. In 1962, he appeared as "Ves Painter" in the short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Stoney Burke]]'', co-starring [[Jack Lord]], a program about [[rodeo]] contestants.

Oates also played in a number of guest roles on ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' (in ''[[The Purple Testament]]'' and ''[[The 7th Is Made Up of Phantoms]]'', in which he costarred with [[Randy Boone]] and [[Ron Foster (actor)|Ron Foster]]), ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' ("[[The Mutant]]" [1964]), ''[[Combat!]] ''("The Pillbox" [1964],) and ''[[Lost in Space]]'' ("Welcome Stranger" [1965]). During the 1960s and 1970s, he guest-starred on such shows as ''[[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|Twelve O'Clock High]]'' (The Hotshot 1965)[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'', and ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''.

In addition to Peckinpah, Oates worked with several major film directors of his era including [[Leslie Stevens]] in the 1960 film ''Private Property'', his first starring role; [[Norman Jewison]] in ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' ([[1967 in film|1967]]); [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] in ''[[There Was a Crooked Man...]]'' (1970); [[John Milius]] in ''[[Dillinger (1973 film)|Dillinger]]'' ([[1973 in film|1973]]); [[Terrence Malick]] in ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' (1973); [[Philip Kaufman]] in ''[[The White Dawn]]'' (1974); [[William Friedkin]] in ''[[The Brink's Job]]'' (1978); and [[Steven Spielberg]] in ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' (1979).

He appeared in the [[Sherman Brothers]] musical version of ''[[Tom Sawyer (1973 film)|Tom Sawyer]]'' as "Muff Potter", the town drunk.  He also starred in ''[[The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond]]'' (1960), ''[[Return of the Seven]]'' (1966), ''[[The Shooting]]'' (filmed in 1965, released in 1968), ''[[The Thief Who Came to Dinner]]'' (1973), ''[[Cockfighter]]'' (1974), ''[[Drum (1976 film)|Drum]]'' (1976) and ''[[China 9, Liberty 37]]'' (1978). Oates co-starred three times with friend [[Peter Fonda]] in ''[[The Hired Hand]]'' (1971), ''[[Race with the Devil]]'' (1975) and ''92 in the Shade'' (1975).

June 18 thru June 26 while making a guest appearance on a segment of ''[http://apacheland.com/filmography/tv-serials-commercials/dundee-and-the-culhane.html Dundee and the Culhane],'' Warren Oates managed to steal the show with his off camera antics and bloopers that had everyone on the set rolling. After a long day of filming, Warren headed over and ''[http://apacheland.com/bootprints/warren-oates.html set his footprints in cement]'' along with all the other stars that appeared at Apacheland Movie Ranch. It was during this time that "Heat of the Night" was a blockbuster summer flick. Warren's role as "Officer Sam Wood" is spectacular as he plays a peeping-tom officer and possible killer in the critically acclaimed film.

Oates was cast in [[Roger Donaldson]]'s 1977 New Zealand film ''[[Sleeping Dogs (1977 film)|Sleeping Dogs]]'' together with New Zealand actor [[Sam Neill]]. A political thriller with action film elements, ''Sleeping Dogs'' follows the lead character "Smith" (Neill) as New Zealand plunges into a police state, as a fascist government institutes martial law after industrial disputes flare into violence. Smith gets caught between the special police and a growing resistance movement and reluctantly becomes involved. Oates plays the role of "Willoughby", commander of the American forces stationed in New Zealand and working with the New Zealand fascist government to find and subdue "rebels" (the resistance movement).

His partnership with Peckinpah resulted in two of his most famous film roles. In the [[1969 in film|1969]] [[Western (genre)|Western]] classic ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'', he portrayed Lyle Gorch, a long-time outlaw who chooses to die with his friends during the film's violent conclusion. According to his wife at the time, Teddy, Oates had the choice of starring in ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', to be filmed in Los Angeles, or ''The Wild Bunch'' in Mexico. "He had done ''Return of the Seven'' in Mexico; he got [[hepatitis]], plus [[dysentery]]. But off he went again with Sam (Peckinpah). He loved going on location. He loved the adventure of it. He had great admiration for Sam. Sam Peckinpah and [[Monte Hellman]] were the two directors Warren would work with anytime anywhere."<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Weddle|authorlink= David Weddle|title=If They Move...Kill 'Em!|publisher=Grove Press |year = 1994|pages=321. ISBN 0-8021-3776-8}}</ref> In ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'', the dark 1974 action/tragedy also filmed in Mexico, Oates played the lead role of Bennie, a hard-drinking down-on-his-luck musician hoping to make a final score. The character was reportedly based on Peckinpah himself. For authenticity, Oates wore the director's sunglasses while filming scenes of the production.

Although the Peckinpah film roles are his best-known, his most critically acclaimed role is GTO in [[Monte Hellman]]'s 1971 cult classic ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]''.  The film, although a failure at the box-office, is studied in film schools as a treasure of the 1970s, in large part due to Oates' heartbreaking portrayal of GTO.  Famed film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] remarked that Oates' performance in this film was as good as any he'd seen and should have won the Oscar.

A year before his death, Oates co-starred with [[Bill Murray]] in the 1981 military comedy ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]''. In the role of the [[drill sergeant]], Sergeant Hulka, Oates skillfully played the straight man to Murray's comedic character. The film was a huge financial success, earning $85 million at the box office.  In 1982, he co-starred opposite [[Jack Nicholson]] in director [[Tony Richardson]]'s ''[[The Border (1982 film)|The Border]]''.

==Death==
Warren Oates died in his sleep while taking an afternoon nap on April 3, 1982 at age 53 in his house in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], of a sudden [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] brought on by chest pains and shortness of breath which began that late morning.<ref name=mph>"Actor Warren Oates Dies", ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', [[Minden, Louisiana]], April 5, 1982, p. 8</ref> After his funeral, his body was cremated and his ashes were scattered at his ranch in [[Montana]].<ref>Compo, Susan A.  ''Warren Oates:  A Wild Life''.  [[University of Kentucky Press]], 2009, ISBN 0-8131-2536-7</ref>

In 1981, nearly one year before his death, he had co-starred in the CBS TV mini-series ''[[The Blue and the Gray (miniseries)|The Blue and the Gray]]'', which aired in November 1982. His last two films, ''[[Blue Thunder]]'' (which was filmed in early 1980) and ''[[Tough Enough (film)|Tough Enough]]'' (which was filmed in late 1981) (both released in [[1983 in film|1983]]), were posthumously dedicated to him. [[Monte Hellman]]'s film ''[[Iguana (film)|Iguana]]'' ends with the titles "For Warren" as a dedication.

==Legacy==
Today, the actor has a dedicated [[cult following]] because of his memorable performances in not only Peckinpah's films, but [[Monte Hellman|Monte Hellman's]] independent works, his films with Peter Fonda and a number of [[B-movies]] from the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mondo-digital.com/twolane.html |title=The Films of Monte Hellman |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.impossiblefunky.com/archives/issue_7/7_hellman.asp?IshNum=7&Headline=Interview%3A%20Monte%20Hellman |title=Monte Hellman: In His Own Words |accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref> His occasionally crude facade, likeable persona and uncommon presence are admired by such filmmakers as [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Richard Linklater]]. During a recent screening of Hellman's ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]'', Linklater introduced the film and announced 16 reasons why viewers should love the [[1971 in film|1971]] movie. The sixth was: "Because there was once a god who walked the Earth named Warren Oates."<ref name=tedstrong/>

The [[documentary film]] ''Warren Oates: Across the Border'' was produced by [[Tom Thurman]] in 1993 in tribute to the actor's career.

Oates was again recognized in March 2009 with the first-ever biography of his colorful life. Featuring interviews with actor's former wives, children, and friends, ''Warren Oates: A Wild Life'', was written by Susan Compo. It has received much acclaim from fans and critics alike.<ref>''Warren Oates - A Wild Life: A Conversation With Biographer Susan Compo''</ref>
