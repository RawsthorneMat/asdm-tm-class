'''Robert Jonathan Demme''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|m|i}}; born February 22, 1944) is an American filmmaker, producer and screenwriter. Best known for directing ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', for which he won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]], he has also directed the acclaimed films ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'', ''[[Rachel Getting Married]]'', the [[Talking Heads]] concert movie ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' and a trilogy of [[Neil Young]] documentary/concert movies. His recent film ''[[A Master Builder]]'' opened in New York during June 2014 and was based on the 19th century play by [[Henrik Ibsen]].

==Career==
Demme broke into feature film working for [[exploitation film]] producer [[Roger Corman]] from 1971 to 1976, co-writing and producing ''[[Angels Hard as They Come]]'' and ''[[The Hot Box]]''. He then moved on to directing, with three films (''[[Caged Heat]]'', ''[[Crazy Mama (film)|Crazy Mama]]'', ''[[Fighting Mad (film)|Fighting Mad]]'') for Corman's studio [[New World Communications|New World Pictures]]. After ''Fighting Mad'', Demme directed the comedy film ''[[Handle with Care (1977 film)|Handle with Care]]'' for [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1977. The film was well received by critics,<ref>{{citation|last=Sragow|first=Michael|year=1984|title=Jonathan Demme on the Line|periodical=American Film|publisher=|volume=|issue=January/February|pages=|url=http://www.storefrontdemme.com/ontheline.html|archiveurl=|archivedate=|issn=|oclc=|accessdate=March 18, 2009|quote=Although his best two movies to date, Citizens Band (AKA Handle With Care, 1977) and Melvin and Howard (1980), were hailed for bringing the heartiness and sensitivity of a homegrown Jean Renoir into latter-day American film comedy, they failed to score at the box office.}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> but received little promotion,<ref name="CB NYT">{{citation|last=Kaplan|first=James|date=March 27, 1988|title =Jonathan Demme's Offbeat America|periodical=The New York Times|pages=6.48|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7D71739F934A15750C0A96E948260&pagewanted=all|accessdate=March 18, 2009|quote=Paramount figured it might just have a sleeper hit in the small movie, but it took a wait-and-see attitude, spending little on advertising and promotion, and hoping the movie would hook onto the C.B. craze and catch.}}</ref> and performed poorly at the box office.<ref>{{citation|last=Williams|first=Phillip|publication-date=October 11, 2002|year=2002|title=The Truth About Jonathan Demme|periodical=[[MovieMaker]]|publisher=|volume=|issue=|pages=|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/the_truth_about_jonathan_demme_3301|issn=|oclc=|accessdate=|quote=We had a great time doing it and we were invited to the New York Film Festival, despite the fact that the film tanked horrendously—and famously—at the box office.}}</ref>

Demme's next film, 1980's ''[[Melvin and Howard]]'', did not get a [[wide release]], but received a groundswell of critical acclaim, and led to the signing of Demme to direct the [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Kurt Russell]] [[star vehicle]] ''[[Swing Shift (film)|Swing Shift]]''.

Demme ended up renouncing the finished product, and when the film was released in May 1984, it was generally panned by critics and neglected by moviegoers.<ref name="Vineberg" /> After ''Swing Shift'', Demme stepped back from Hollywood to make the [[Talking Heads]] [[concert film]] ''[[Stop Making Sense]]''; the eclectic screwball action-romantic comedy ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]''; a film-version of the stage production ''[[Swimming to Cambodia]]'', by monologist [[Spalding Gray]]; and the New York Mafia-by-way-of Downtown comedy ''[[Married to the Mob]]''.{{cref|a}}

In 1991, Demme won the Academy Award for ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''—one of only three films to win all the major categories (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress). Demme followed that up with ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]'', which garnered star [[Tom Hanks]] a Best Actor [[Academy Award|Oscar]].

Since then, Demme's films have included an adaptation of [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''[[Beloved (film)|Beloved]]'', and remakes of two popular films: ''[[The Truth About Charlie]]'', based on ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' that starred [[Mark Wahlberg]] in the [[Cary Grant]] role; and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', with [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Meryl Streep]].

In 2007, Demme's film ''[[Man from Plains]]'', a documentary about former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s book tour in promotion of his book ''[[Palestine: Peace not Apartheid]]'', premiered at the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals.

In 2008, the art-house hit ''[[Rachel Getting Married]]'' was released, which many critics compared to Demme's films of the late 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{citation|last=Burr|first=Ty|publication-date=October 12, 2008|year=2008|title=He's back|periodical=The Boston Globe|publisher=|pages=|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2008/10/12/hes_back/|issn=|oclc=|accessdate=March 19, 2009|quote=Warm rather than cold, forgiving rather than damning, ''Rachel'' is a throwback to the fluky, generous vibe that sustained the director's films in the late 1970s and 1980s – ''Handle With Care'' (1977), ''Melvin and Howard'' (1980), ''Stop Making Sense'' (1984), ''Something Wild'' (1986) and ''Married to the Mob'' (1988).}}

In 2010, Demme made his first foray into theater, directing ''Family Week'', a play by [[Beth Henley]]. The play was produced by [[MCC Theater]] and co-starred [[Rosemarie DeWitt]] and [[Sarah Jones (stage actress)|Sarah Jones]].

At one time, Demme was signed on to direct, produce, and write an adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s sci-fi novel ''[[11/22/63]]'', but later left due to disagreements with King on what should be included in the script.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Brian|title=Stephen King's 11/22/63 Loses Jonathan Demme|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/stephen-kings-11-22-63-loses-jonathan-demme|accessdate=27 October 2013|date=December 6, 2012}}</ref>

Demme has directed music videos for artists such as [[Suburban Lawns]], [[New Order]], [[KRS-One]]'s [[H.E.A.L.]] project and [[Bruce Springsteen]].
He also produced a compilation of Haitian music called ''Konbit: Burning Rhythms of Haiti'' that was released in 1989. ([[Lou Reed]] selected ''Konbit...'' as one of his 'picks of 1989'.<ref>''[[Rolling Stone]]'', March 8, 1990</ref>
)

Demme is on the board of directors at [[Jacob Burns Film Center]] in [[Pleasantville, NY]]. In addition to his role on the board, he curates and hosts a monthly series called "Rarely Seen Cinema".

==Clinica Estetico==
Demme formed his production company, Clinica Estetico, with producers [[Edward Saxon]] and [[Peter Saraf]]. They were based out of New York City for fifteen years.

==Personal life==
Demme was born in 1944 in [[Baldwin, Nassau County, New York]], the son of Dorothy Louise (Rogers) and Robert Eugene Demme, a public relations executive.<ref>http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/a/l/l/Bonnie-B-Allen/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0067.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/38/Jonathan-Demme.html|title=Jonathan Demme Biography (1944–)|accessdate=March 19, 2009 |work=Film Reference}}</ref> He graduated from [[Southwest Miami High School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.webster.edu/~corbetre/haiti-archive-new/msg14850.html |title=14902: The silenced voice of Radio Haiti speaks again on film (fwd) |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}</ref> and the [[University of Florida]].
