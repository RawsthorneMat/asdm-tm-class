'''Dolph Lundgren''' (born '''Hans Lundgren'''; 3 November 1957) is a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] actor, [[film director|director]], and [[martial artist]]. He belongs to a generation of film actors who epitomise the [[action hero]] stereotype, alongside [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Chuck Norris]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Steven Seagal]], and [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]].

He received a degree in chemistry from [[Washington State University]]<nowiki/>, a degree in chemical engineering from the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm in the early 1980s, then a master's degree in chemical engineering from the [[University of Sydney]] in [[Sydney, Australia]] in 1982. Lundgren holds a rank of 3rd ''[[Dan (rank)|dan]]'' [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]] and was European champion in 1980 and 1981. While in Sydney, he became a bodyguard for [[Jamaica]]n singer [[Grace Jones]] and began a relationship with her. They moved together to [[New York City]], where after a short stint as a model and bouncer at the [[Manhattan]] nightclub [[The Limelight]], Jones got him a small debut role in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' as a [[KGB]] henchman.

Lundgren's breakthrough came when he starred in ''[[Rocky IV]]'' in 1985 as the imposing [[Russians|Russian]] [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Ivan Drago]]. Since then, he has starred in more than 40 movies, almost all of them in the action genre. He portrayed [[He-Man]] in the 1987 fantasy/science fiction film ''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]'', and [[Punisher|Frank Castle]] in the 1989 film ''[[The Punisher (1989 film)|The Punisher]]''. In the early 1990s, he also appeared in films such as ''[[I Come in Peace|Dark Angel]]'' (1990); ''[[Showdown in Little Tokyo]]'' (1991), alongside [[Brandon Lee]]; ''[[Universal Soldier (1992 film)|Universal Soldier]]'' (1992) opposite [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]; ''[[Joshua Tree (1993 film)|Joshua Tree]]'' (1993), opposite [[Kristian Alfonso]] and [[George Segal]]; ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]'' (1995), opposite [[Keanu Reeves]]; and ''[[Blackjack (film)|Blackjack]]'' (1998), directed by [[John Woo]]. In 2004, Lundgren directed his first picture, ''[[The Defender (2004 film)|The Defender]]'', and subsequently helmed ''[[The Mechanik]]'' (2005), ''[[Missionary Man (film)|Missionary Man]]'' (2007), ''[[Command Performance (2008 film)|Command Performance]]'' (2009), and ''[[Icarus (film)|Icarus]]'' (2010), in which he also starred. After a long spell performing in [[direct-to-video]] films since 1995, 2010 marked his return to theaters with ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'', an on-screen reunion with Stallone, alongside an all-action star cast which included, among others, [[Jason Statham]], [[Jet Li]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], and [[Mickey Rourke]]. He reprised his role as Gunner Jensen in ''[[The Expendables 2]]'' in 2012 and ''[[The Expendables 3]]'' in 2014.

===Education===
[[File:Royal Institute of Technology - Stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Institute of Technology]], Stockholm]]
Lundgren stated that "my dad always told me that if I wanted to make something special with my life, I had to go to America."<ref name="The Official biography"/> After graduating from [[high school]] with straight As, he spent some time in the [[United States]] in the 1970s on various academic scholarships, studying chemistry at [[Washington State University]] and [[Clemson University]]. He received a degree in Chemistry from Washington State University, then served his mandatory one year in the [[Swedish Amphibious Corps|Swedish Marine Corps]] at the [[Kustjägarna|Amphibious Ranger School.]]  In the late 1970s, he enrolled at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm and graduated with a degree in chemical engineering.<ref name="The Official biography"/>

Amidst his years of studying, Lundgren honed his karate skills by training hard in the dojo for five years, attaining the rank of 2nd ''[[Dan (rank)|dan]]'' [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[Kyokushin]] in 1978. He captained the Swedish Kyokushin karate team, and was a formidable challenger at the 1979 World [[Open Tournament]] (arranged by the [[Kyokushin Karate Organization]]) when he was only a green belt. He won the European championships in 1980 and 1981, and a heavyweight tournament in Australia in 1982.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1362042/Dolph-Lundgren-shows-looking-good-takes-effort-shows-Karate-moves-park.html |title=Dolph Lundgren proves looking good takes hard work as he practises martial arts in the park|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|accessdate=1 August 2011|date= 2 March 2011|location=London}}</ref> Dolph continued training kyokushin karate after leaving his tournament career, when his new career allowed, and eventually graded to 3rd ''dan'' in July 1998, in the Shinkyokushin organization of Kyokushin karate. The formal grading took place in Stockholms kyokushin karate Gym, in Stockholm, Sweden. Lundgren is often seen on Shinkyokushin tournament events, doing karate exhibitions during breaks.

In 1982, Lundgren graduated with a [[master's degree]] in [[chemical engineering]] from the [[University of Sydney]]. During his time in [[Sydney]], he earned a living as a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] in a nightclub in the renowned [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|King's Cross]] area. He was awarded a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholarship]] to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1983. However, while preparing for the move to [[Boston]], he was spotted in the nightclub he worked at in Sydney and was hired by [[Grace Jones]] as a bodyguard, and the two became lovers.<ref name="I1">{{cite video|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cTdWLBO8DM|title=Dolph Lundgren interview|publisher=Blockbuster, Youtube|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> Their relationship developed dramatically, and he moved with her to [[New York City]].<ref name="Chafetz2008">{{cite book|last=Chafetz|first=Gary S.|title=The Perfect Villain: John McCain and the Demonization of Lobbyist Jack Abramoff|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VewbAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 May 2011|date=September 2008|publisher=Martin and Lawrence Press|isbn=978-0-9773898-8-9|page=60}}</ref>

===New York City===
[[File:Club formerly known as Limelight NYC.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Limelight]] in [[Manhattan]], a former church, where Lundgren worked as a bouncer]]
While living with Grace Jones in her New York City apartment, Lundgren dabbled in modeling at the [[Zoli Agency]] but was described as "a bit too tall and muscular for a model's size 40".<ref name="The Official biography"/> He earned a living as a bouncer at the Manhattan nightclub [[The Limelight]]; housed in a former [[Episcopal Church in the United States|Episcopal]] [[Church of the Holy Communion and Buildings|Church of the Holy Communion]], working with [[Chazz Palminteri]].<ref name="The Official biography"/>

In the daytime, he studied drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop and has said that "my time in New York City opened up my adolescent Swedish eyes to a multitude of different people and lifestyles, mostly in the arts. I hung out with [[Andy Warhol]], [[Keith Haring]], [[Iman (model)|Iman]] and [[Steve Rubell]], danced at [[Studio 54]], and studied acting with [[Andie MacDowell]] and [[Tom Hulce]]."<ref name="The Official biography"/> Standing 6'5" (195&nbsp;cm), with a heavily muscular frame and distinctive looks, he stood out, and was told by friends that he could make it in movies.<ref name="The Official biography"/> He would later quit studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after two weeks to pursue acting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800058493/bio|title=Dolph Lundgren biography at|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref>

==Film career==

===1980s===
On set of the [[James Bond]] film ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', Jones suggested that he try out for a part in the film which led to his [[feature film]] debut playing the very minor role of a suited [[KGB]] henchman named Venz.<ref name="Film review">{{cite book|title=Film review|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-ZcqAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=21 May 2011|year=1990|publisher=Orpheus Pub.}}</ref><ref name="Rubin2003">{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Steven Jay|title=The complete James Bond movie encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0HTQISb1hY0C|accessdate=21 May 2011|year=2003|publisher=Contemporary Books|isbn=978-0-07-141246-9|page=432}}</ref> In the film, Dolph is seen briefly in the scene in which the KGB's [[General Gogol]] ([[Walter Gotell]]) confronts [[Max Zorin]] ([[Christopher Walken]]) about leaving the KGB at a racing ground and ends in a minor brawl in which Lundgren's character Venz points a gun at Zorin. [[Roger Moore]], in his last performance as James Bond, once memorably said "Dolph is larger than Denmark".<ref name="I1"/> Lundgren found the entertainment business more attractive and rewarding than chemical engineering so he decided to pursue a career in acting despite having no formal training.<ref name="I1"/> Upon learning that [[Sylvester Stallone]] was on the lookout for an imposing fighter to play [[Ivan Drago]] in ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985), Lundgren sent off videos and pictures of himself to a distant contact of Stallone, which eventually got through to him. Lundgren tried out for the role, but as he stated himself, he was initially turned down for the role because he was too tall.<ref name="Film review"/>

However, he eventually beat 5,000 other hopefuls to land his [[breakout role]] opposite Stallone, [[Carl Weathers]] and [[Brigitte Nielsen]]. To improve his physique and athletic abilities for the role of Drago, he trained intensely in [[bodybuilding]] and [[boxing]] for five months before the film was shot. Lundgren said, "We trained six days a week—weights in the morning for about an hour, then boxing in the afternoon. We did a split of chest and back one day and then shoulders, legs, and arms the next. We boxed for an hour and a half, practiced the fight choreography, and did bag work and abs."<ref name="FA">{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0801/is_6_72/ai_n57642640/?tag=mantle_skin|title=He must break you: Dolph Lundgren reflects on playing Drago, crazed fans, and why you shouldn't break into his house|publisher=''[[Muscle & Fitness]]''|accessdate=4 October 2011|year=2011}}</ref> He weighed {{convert|235|lb|kg}} – {{convert|245|lb|kg}} during the filming,<ref name="FA"/> but in the film he was billed at {{convert|261|lb|kg}}; one publisher said of Drago, "He's a hulking 261&nbsp;pounds of merciless fighting machine, the best that Soviet science & medicine can create".<ref name="Bowker's Complete Video Directory 2002: Entertainment : titles A-S.">{{cite book|title=Bowker's Complete Video Directory 2002: Entertainment : titles A-S.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KBJlAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 May 2011|year=2002|publisher=Bowker|isbn=978-0-8352-4478-7|page=1213}}</ref> His lines "If he dies, he dies" and "I must break you" are amongst the best known of the Rocky series and have been cited in popular culture.<ref name="Kluck2009">{{cite book|last=Kluck|first=Ted|title=The Reason for Sports: A Christian Fanifesto|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i-I3IR838XgC&pg=PA117|accessdate=22 May 2011|date=1 August 2009|publisher=Moody Publishers|isbn=978-0-8024-5836-0|page=117}}</ref><ref name="Allred2009">{{cite book|last=Allred|first=Lance|title=Longshot: The Adventures of a Deaf Fundamentalist Mormon Kid and His Journey to the NBA|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pnENAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 May 2011|date=15 May 2009|publisher=HarperOne|isbn=978-0-06-171858-8}}</ref>

I was shell-shocked for years from the mind-boggling and daunting experience of being a student-athlete from tiny Sweden suddenly having to live up a new action-star persona."<ref name="The Official biography"/>

Lundgren received his first lead role as the mighty [[He-Man]] in ''[[Masters of the Universe (film)|Masters of the Universe]]'' (1987), based on the [[He-Man|popular children's toyline and cartoon]]. He starred alongside [[Frank Langella]], [[Meg Foster]], [[Chelsea Field]], [[Billy Barty]] and [[Courteney Cox]]. Lundgren weighed his all time heaviest during the filming at {{convert|250|lb|kg}}.<ref name="FA"/> The film was a critical failure and viewed as far too violent for a family picture.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Masters of the Universe' Misfires |publisher= The Los Angeles Times|date=12 August 1987|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-12/entertainment/ca-349_1_movie-masters-universe|accessdate=20 May 2011 | first=Michael | last=Wilmington}}</ref><ref name="Nash1988">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Jay Robert|title=The Motion Picture Guide 1988 Annual: The Films of 1987|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BYkqAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=20 May 2011|year=1988|publisher=Cinebooks|isbn=978-0-933997-16-5|page=41}}</ref> It is referred to as a "flop" by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine,<ref name="superherohype">{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=5736 |title="He-Man Returning to the Big Screen" superherohype.com/''Variety''; 24 May 2007 |publisher=Superherohype.com |accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref> and has a 13% "rotten" rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/masters_of_the_universe/ |title=Masters of the Universe at Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref> Lundgren was criticized for being too wooden as a leading man, and it was dismissed as "a glossy fantasy starring monosyllabic Dolph Lundgren."<ref name="Julius1996">{{cite book|last=Julius|first=Marshall|title=Action!: the action movie A-Z|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rlkbAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=20 May 2011|date=5 September 1996|publisher=Batsford|isbn=978-0-7134-7851-8|page=6}}</ref>

Lundgren next starred in [[Joseph Zito]]'s ''[[Red Scorpion]]'' in 1989, opposite [[M. Emmet Walsh]], [[Al White]], [[T. P. McKenna]] and [[Carmen Argenziano]]. The plot centers on Lundgren's character Nikolai, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Spetsnaz]]-trained [[KGB]] agent who is sent to an [[Africa]]n country where [[Military of the Soviet Union|Soviet]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Military of Cuba|Cuban forces]] are helping the government fight an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] rebel movement. Nikolai is ordered to assassinate the movement's leader, but eventually turns against his government by switching sides. The film was partly shot in [[Namibia]] and it was claimed that Grace Jones joined him during production in [[Swakopmund]], insisting on staying in a $3000 a month villa, even though his new girlfriend at the time was reported to be [[Paula Barbieri]].<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite book|last=Chafetz|first=Gary S.|title=The Perfect Villain: John McCain and the Demonization of Lobbyist Jack Abramoff|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VewbAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 May 2011|date=September 2008|publisher=Martin and Lawrence Press|isbn=978-0-9773898-8-9|page=65}}</ref> The film was poorly received and has an 11% "rotten" rating at Rotten Tomatoes. [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said as follows: "Dolph Lundgren's pectorals are the real stars of ''Red Scorpion,'' an action-adventure movie set in the fictional African country of Mombaka. Filmed from below so that one has the sense of peering up at a massive kinetic sculpture, his glistening torso, which over the course of the film is subjected to assorted tortures, is the movie's primary visual focus whenever the action slows down. And since Mr. Lundgren remains stone-faced, rarely speaking except to issue commands in a surprisingly hesitant monotone, his heaving chest actually communicates more emotion than his mumbling lips."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=950DE4D7143EF932A15757C0A96F948260|author=Holden, Stephen|title=Red Scorpion|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=21 April 1989|accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref>

Lundgren then starred as [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Frank Castle]] (a.k.a. The [[Punisher]]) in the 1989 film ''[[The Punisher (1989 film)|The Punisher]]''. The film was directed by [[Mark Goldblatt]], with a screenplay by [[Boaz Yakin]]. Although it is based on the Marvel Comics character, the film changes many details of the original comic book origin and the main character does not wear the trademark "skull".

In 1990, Lundgren starred in [[Craig R.

In 2005, Lundgren starred and directed his second picture ''[[The Mechanik]]'' (The Russian Specialist), playing a retired Russian Special Forces hit man Nikolai "Nick" Cherenko caught in the crossfire with Russian mobsters.

According to Lundgren, it had long been a desire of his to direct a western, having long been a fan of [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[John Wayne]], yet he did not want to spend the time and money building an old western town and hiring horses, so decided to set it in modern times with a motorbike instead of entering the town on a horse in the manner than Clint Eastwood would.<ref name="AFI Dallas"/> Lundgren's co-writer, [[Frank Valdez]]'s wife's brother happened to be a notable actor working in Texas and invited Lundgren's team to shoot there.<ref name="AFI Dallas"/> The film was shot on location in [[Waxahachie, Texas|Waxahachie]], a southern suburb of [[Dallas]] and was produced by Andrew Stevens and it was specially screened at the 2008 AFI Dallas Film Festival.<ref name="AFI Dallas"/><ref name=autogenerated11>{{cite book|title=The Hollywood reporter|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0cbAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=22 May 2011|year=2007|publisher=Hollywood Reporter Inc.}}</ref>

The film co-starred Canadian pop singer [[Melissa Smith]], playing a world famous pop singer in the film and his own daughter Ida on her screen debut, who played one of the daughters of the Russian president.

==Training and diet==

Although Lundgren never competed as a professional bodybuilder, he has been closely associated with bodybuilding and fitness since his role as Drago in the mid-1980s. Bodybuilding.com said "looking like a man in his 30s rather than his 50s, Lundgren is the poster boy of precise nutrition, supplementation and exercise application that he has practiced for over 35 years."<ref name="BBI">{{citation|title=Dolph Lundgren Interview|publisher=Bodybuilding.com|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> In an interview with them he claims to often train up to six days a week in the gym, usually one hour sessions completed in the morning, saying that "it's just one hour a day, and then you can enjoy the other 23 hours".<ref name="Bodybuilding">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oboq-208Xx8&feature=related|title=Dolph Lundgren: Interview (Part 1)|publisher=Youtube.com|accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref> Although he had begun lifting weights as a teenager, he cites Sylvester Stallone as the man who got him into serious bodybuilding for a period in the 1980s after arriving in the United States.<ref name="Bodybuilding"/> Stallone had a lasting influence on his fitness regime and his diet, ensuring that he ate a much higher percentage of protein in his diet and eating 5 or 6 smaller meals a day.<ref name="BBI"/> Lundgren has professed to never have been "superstrong", saying that, "I'm too tall and my arms are long. I think back then [Rocky IV] I was working with around 300 pounds on the bench and squat.<ref name="FA"/>

In a January 2011 interview with ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' he announced he is working on releasing his own range of vitamins and supplements.<ref name="GQ">{{cite web|title=Dolph Lundgren interview|work=[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]|accessdate=22 May 2011|year=2011|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/-01/12/gq-film-dolph-lundgren-expendables-interview/drinks-supplements-protein}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphsports.com/ |title=DolphSports, svensktillverkade kosttillskott |publisher=Dolphsports.com |date= |accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref>
