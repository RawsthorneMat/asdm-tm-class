'''Indus Arthur''' (April 28, 1941 – December 29, 1984) was an actress in motion pictures and television in the 1960s.

==Background==
Born Indus Jo Saugstad, she was from [[Los Angeles County]]. She had blue eyes, blonde hair, and ''a humorous quirk to her lips.'' Both Arthur and her grandmother were named for the [[Indus River]] in [[Tibet]]. Her grandmother once visited the river, and Arthur possessed a desire to do so. Her father was a still cameraman for a number of [[Hollywood]] studios. He opposed the fact that Arthur and her two sisters were becoming involved in films.

==Stage==
Arthur signed as the [[leading lady]] for the mystery play, ''Uncle Marston'', in April 1963. The production was staged at the Stage Society Theater in [[Los Angeles, California]]. A reviewer referred to her acting prowess in the role of an agitated [[Derbyshire]] heiress, commenting ''Arthur is a lovely, polished performer.'' Previously she had appeared in theater in [[London, England]] and at the Dublin Playhouse in [[Dublin, Ireland]].

==Movies==
[[Sydney Pollack]]'s directing debut ''[[The Slender Thread]]'' (1965) showcases two fine acting talents in [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Anne Bancroft]]. As ''Marian'', Arthur plays an employee of a crisis clinic which counsels potential [[suicide]] victims.

She was assigned a role in ''Alvarez Kelly'' (1966), a western that was set during the era of the [[American Civil War]]. It featured a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] cattleman played by [[William Holden]] and a military colonel depicted by [[Richard Widmark]].

Arthur's other movies are ''Angel's Flight'' (1965), ''[[MASH (film)|M* A* S* H]]'' (1970), and ''[[The Christian Licorice Store]]'' (1971).

==Television==
Arthur was a prolific actress on television. Among her many appearances are episodes of the ''Kraft Suspense Theater'' (1964–1965), ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents|The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'' (1965), ''[[Ben Casey]]'' (1965), ''[[T.H.E. Cat]]'' (1966), ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1966), ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' (1966), ''[[Dragnet (series)#Television|Dragnet]]'' (1967), and ''[[General Hospital]]'' (1963, 1970–1973). She made two guest appearances on ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' (1965–1966); first as Nancy Bryant in "The Case of the Telltale Tap," then as defendant, Barbara Kramer, in "The Case of the Dead Ringer", when series star, [[Raymond Burr]], doubled as Perry and Grimes, the murderer.

==Personal life==
Arthur became a proponent of good [[skin care]], in part because of her difficulty with overactive oil glands. She shared diet tips with others, suggesting that people avoid foods with [[iodine]], like salt and [[shellfish]]. She advised that steaming the face would keep the pores entirely clean. Arthur used an electronic steamer for instant steam with no risk of burning herself.

Near the end of her life, Arthur entertained as a singer and [[harpist]] in clubs like the Scripture Gardens Coffee House in [[Venice, California]].

Indus Arthur died in Los Angeles County in 1984 of [[skin cancer]] at age 43.
