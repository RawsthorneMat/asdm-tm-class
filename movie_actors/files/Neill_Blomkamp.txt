'''Neill Blomkamp''' (born 17 September 1979) is a [[South African]]–[[Canadian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/movies/features/58191/|accessdate=15 May 2011|title=District Supervisor: Neill Blomkamp|publisher=nymag.com}}</ref> film and advertisement [[film director|director]], [[Screenwriter|writer]], [[Film producer|producer]] and [[animator]]. Blomkamp employs a documentary-style, [[Hand-held camera|hand-held]], [[cinéma vérité]] technique, blending naturalistic and photo-realistic [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] effects. He is best known as the co-writer and director of the critically acclaimed and financially successful science fiction film ''[[District 9]]'' and the dystopian science fiction film ''[[Elysium (film)|Elysium]]'', which garnered moderately positive reviews and a good box office return. He is also known for his collaborations with South African actor [[Sharlto Copley]]. He is based in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]].

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named Blomkamp as one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/neill_blomkamp_named_one_of_the_most_influential_people_of_the_year_3910050/ |title=Neill Blomkamp |work=[[MovieMaker]] |accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>
''[[Forbes]]'' magazine named him as the 21st most powerful celebrity from [[Africa]].

==Early life==
Blomkamp was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. At the age of sixteen, he met [[Sharlto Copley]], who had also attended [[Redhill School (Johannesburg)|Redhill High School]] in Johannesburg. Copley provided Blomkamp with the use of computers at his production company, for Blomkamp to pursue his passion and talent for [[3D animation]] and design. In return, Blomkamp assisted Copley in creating 3D work for pitches on various projects. Blomkamp was 18 when he moved to [[Vancouver]] with his family, where he enrolled in [[Vancouver Film School]].

==Career==
In the late 1990s, he started working in the film industry as a 3D animator. His animation credits include ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' (1998), ''[[First Wave (TV series)|First Wave]]'' (1998), ''[[Mercy Point]]'' (1998) and ''[[Aftershock: Earthquake in New York]]'' (1999). In 2000, he garnered his first role of lead animator for the ''[[Dark Angel (TV series)|Dark Angel]]'' TV series (2000). He was the lead 3D animator for ''[[3000 Miles to Graceland]]'' (2001).

In 2003, he was hired to illustrate photo-realistic future aircraft for ''[[Popular Science]]'''s "Next Century in Aviation". In 2004, he illustrated "The Future of the Automobile".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-district2-2009aug02,0,5378775.story|title=Neill Blomkamp's 'District 9' wins over fanboys and Peter Jackson|author=Chris Lee | work=Los Angeles Times|date=2009-08-02}}</ref> Blomkamp worked as a visual effects artist at [[The Embassy Visual Effects]] in Vancouver as well as at [[Rainmaker Digital Effects]], and was {{citation needed span|signed by Toronto commercial house ''Spy Films''.|reason=signed by when he was with the 2 design houses, or later?|date=February 2014}} Blomkamp directed a trilogy of live-action short films in 2007, known collectively as ''Landfall''. They were set in the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' universe, to promote the release of ''[[Halo 3]]''.

Blomkamp was then slated to direct his first feature-length film, an adaptation of the ''Halo'' series of video games, produced by [[Peter Jackson]]. Jackson came to know of Blomkamp after viewing a reel of his commercial work and shorts, shot in his off time. The four shorts that got him noticed included: ''Tetra Vaal'', a faux advertisement for a third-world robotic police that established Blomkamp's signature style of mixing lo-fi production with seamless CGI; ''[[Alive in Joburg]]'', a gritty "documentary" about extraterrestrials marooned in Johannesburg; ''Tempbot'', an ''[[Office Space]]''-esque spoof; and ''[[Yellow (2006 short film)|Yellow]]'', a short film based on the colour yellow for Adidas' "Adicolor" campaign by digital studio IDEALOGUE, which portrays a globe-trotting android gone rogue.

Blomkamp has admitted since that the ''Halo'' pre-production was a nightmare, and relations between 20th Century Fox and Blomkamp severely disintegrated before the project's end.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://oneroomwithaview.com/2013/04/21/best-films-never-made-3-neill-blomkamps-halo/|title=Best Films Never Made: Neill Blomkamp's Halo|author=David Brake | work=One Room With A View|date=2013-04-21}}</ref> When funding for the ''Halo'' film collapsed,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/films/news/article.cfm?c_id=200&objectid=10585084&pnum=3|title=Jackson's new sci-fi film a return to his origins|author=Russell Baillie | work=The New Zealand Herald|date=2009-07-18}}</ref> [[Peter Jackson]] decided to produce ''[[District 9]]'' instead, an adaptation of Blomkamp's earlier short film ''Alive in Joburg'', which had been produced by Hansen and Copley. The film, directed by Blomkamp, starring Copley, and co-written with Blomkamp's wife and production partner [[Terri Tatchell]], was released in mid-August 2009 to widespread critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-tc-mov-district-9-director-0aug12,0,1897423.story|title=‘District 9’ director is no neophyte in an alien land | work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> ''District 9'' was later nominated for the 2009 [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], along with nominations for Best Visual Effects, Editing, and Adapted Screenplay.

On October 2010, a video released on the [[iPad]] version of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' was credited to Neill Blomkamp. It shows an amateur recording of two young men who find a dead mutated creature in a puddle of mud while driving down a countryside road. The creature, a dog-sized mix between a pig and a lizard, presents a tattooed seal on its side that reads "18.12 AGM Heartland Pat. Pend. USA".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.wired.com/underwire/tag/agm-heartland/ | work=Wired | first=Lewis | last=Wallace | title=Video: Neill Blomkamp Takes a Stab at Something Creepy (and Cryptic)}}</ref> Also, "AGM Heartland" was trademarked for its use in an entertainment-oriented website. On 20 February 2012, a 23-second video clip titled "IS IT DEAD?" appeared on [[YouTube]], featuring [[Yolandi Visser]], of the South African group [[Die Antwoord]], crouching over the creature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxFE6Q5y8zw|title=IS IT DEAD?|publisher=YouTube.com}}</ref> Blomkamp admitted that he was still interested in making a ''Halo'' film in April 2013.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/10/elysiums-neill-blomkamp-would-still-love-to-make-a-halo-movie Elysium's Neill Blomkamp Would Still Love to Make a Halo Movie]</ref>
 
After ''Elysium'', he started work on his next sci-fi film, ''[[Chappie (film)|Chappie]]'', in April 2013. The film was based on his own short, ''Tetra Vaal''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Neill Blomkamp on his next sci-fi film, Chappie|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/chappie/25920/exclusive-neill-blomkamp-on-his-next-sci-fi-film-chappie|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=denofgeek.com|date=11 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Neill Blomkamp Talks Chappie|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=34580|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=empireonline.com|date=14 July 2012}}</ref> Blomkamp directed and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] ([[Columbia Pictures]]) and [[Media Rights Capital]] co-produced and co-financed the film, which was released March 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sony, MRC Reunite With Neill Blomkamp on ‘Chappie’|url=http://variety.com/2013/film/news/sony-mrc-reunite-with-neill-blomkamp-on-chappie-1200577403/|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=variety.com|date=13 August 2013}}</ref>
