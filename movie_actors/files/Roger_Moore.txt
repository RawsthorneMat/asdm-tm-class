'''Sir Roger George Moore''' [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] (born 14 October 1927) is an English actor. He is perhaps best known for playing British secret agent [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] in seven films between 1973 and 1985 and he is the oldest actor to have played Bond. Moore also portrayed [[Simon Templar]] in ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' from 1962 to 1969. He is a [[Goodwill Ambassador]] for the charity organisation [[UNICEF]].

==Early life==
Roger Moore was born on 14 October 1927 in [[Stockwell]], now part of the [[London Borough of Lambeth]], in [[London]]. The only child of George Alfred Moore, a policeman, and Lillian "Lily" ([[married and maiden names|née]] Pope), a housewife,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/21/Roger-Moore.html |title=Roger Moore Biography (1927–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=18 June 2010}}</ref> he attended [[Battersea Grammar School]], but was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to [[Holsworthy, Devon]], during [[World War II]]. He was then educated at [[Dr Challoner's Grammar School]] in [[Amersham]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. He then attended the [[College of St Hild and St Bede|College of the Venerable Bede]] at the [[University of Durham]], but did not graduate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.durhamstudent.co.uk/colleges/st-hild-and-st-bede/ |title=Link to durham student description of Hild Bede |date=2 February 2014 |accessdate=2 February 2014}}</ref>

At 18, shortly after the end of World War II, Moore was [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|conscripted]] for [[national service]]. On 21 September 1946, he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] into the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] as a [[second lieutenant]]. He was given the [[service number]] 372394.<ref name="LG 19 November 1946">{{London Gazette |issue=37793 |date=19 November 1946 |startpage=5719 |endpage= |supp=yes |accessdate=2012-10-30}}</ref> He eventually became a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]. Moore served commanding a small depot in [[West Germany]]. He later looked after entertainers for the armed forces passing through Hamburg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishforcesbroadcasting.com/cse/how_it_all_began |title=Link to http://www.britishforcesbroadcasting.com |publisher= Combined Services Entertainment |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>

Immediately prior to his national service, he studied for two terms at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], during which his fees were paid by film director [[Brian Desmond Hurst]], who also used Moore as an [[extra (actor)|extra]] in his film ''[[Trottie True]]''. At RADA, Moore was a classmate of his future Bond costar [[Lois Maxwell]], the original [[Miss Moneypenny]]. Moore chose to leave RADA after six months in order to seek paid employment as an actor. His film idol was [[Stewart Granger]]. At the age of 17, Moore appeared as an extra in the film ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (film)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' (1945), meeting his idol on the set. Later Moore and Granger were both in ''[[The Wild Geese]]'' (1978), though they had no scenes together.

==Career==

===Early work (1945–1959)===
In the early 1950s, Moore worked as a model, appearing in print advertisements for [[knitwear]] (earning him the amusing nickname "The Big Knit"), and a wide range of other products such as toothpaste{{spaced ndash}}an element that many critics have used as typifying his lightweight credentials as an actor. In his book, ''Last Man Standing: Tales From Tinseltown'', Moore states in Ch 2 that his first television appearance was on 27 March 1949, in ''The Governess'', by Patrick Hamilton, it was a live broadcast (as usual in that era) and he played the minor part of 'Bob Drew'.<ref name="Moore">

</ref> Other actors included [[Clive Morton]] and [[Betty Ann Davies]].

Although Moore signed a seven-year contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] in 1954, the films which followed were not a success and, in his own words, "At MGM, RGM (Roger George Moore) was NBG [no bloody good]." He appeared in ''[[Interrupted Melody]]'' -- billed third under [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Eleanor Parker]] -- a biographical movie about an opera singer's recovery from polio. That same year, he played a supporting role in ''[[The King's Thief]]'' starring [[Ann Blyth]], [[Edmund Purdom]], [[David Niven]] and [[George Sanders]], all of whom had larger roles than Moore.

In the 1956 film ''[[Diane (film)|Diane]]'', Moore was billed third again, this time under [[Lana Turner]] and [[Pedro Armendariz]] in a 16th-century period piece set in France with Moore playing [[Henry II of France|Prince Henri]], the future king. Moore was released from his MGM contract after only two years following the critical and commercial failure of ''[[Diane (film)|Diane]]''. After that, he spent a few years mainly doing one-shot parts in television series, including an episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' in 1959 entitled "The Avon Emeralds."  His starring role in ''[[The Miracle (1959 film)|The Miracle]]'' (1959), a version of the play ''[[Das Mirakel (play)|Das Mirakel]]'' for [[Warner Bros.]] showcasing [[Carroll Baker]] as a nun, had been turned down by [[Dirk Bogarde]].  That same year, Moore was directed by [[Arthur Hiller]] in "The Angry Young Man," an episode of the television series ''[[The Third Man (TV series)|The Third Man]]'' starring [[Michael Rennie]] as criminal mastermind Harry Lime, the role portrayed by [[Orson Welles]] in the [[The Third Man|movie version]].

===Television series (1958-1972)===

====''Ivanhoe'' (1958–1959)====
Eventually, Moore made his name in television. He was the eponymous hero, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, in the 1958-59 series ''[[Ivanhoe (1958 TV series)|Ivanhoe]]'', a loose adaptation of the [[Ivanhoe|1819 romantic novel]] by [[Sir Walter Scott]] set in the 1100s during the era of [[Richard the Lionheart]], delving into Ivanhoe's conflict with [[John, King of England|Prince John]]. Shot mainly in England at [[Elstree Studios]] and [[Buckinghamshire]], some of the show was also filmed in California due to a partnership with [[Columbia Studios]]' [[Screen Gems]]. Aimed at younger audiences, the [[Television pilot|pilot]] was filmed in color, a reflection of its comparatively high budget for a British children's adventure series of the period, but subsequent episodes were shot in black and white.<ref name=screenonline>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1137405/ ''Ivanhoe'' at Ivanhoe at Screen Online]</ref> [[Christopher Lee]] and [[John Schlesinger]] were among the show's guest stars and series regulars included [[Robert Brown (British actor)|Robert Brown]] (who in the 1980s would play [[M (James Bond)|M]] in several [[James Bond]] films) as the squire Gurth, [[Peter Gilmore]] as  Waldo Ivanhoe, [[Andrew Keir]] as villainous Prince John, and [[Bruce Seton]] as noble King Richard.  Moore suffered broken ribs and a battle-axe blow to his helmet while performing some of his own stunts filming a season of 39 half-hour episodes and later reminisced, 'I felt a complete Charlie riding around in all that armour and damned stupid plumed helmet. I felt like a medieval fireman.'<ref name=tvheaven>[http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/ivanhoe.htm ''Ivanhoe'' at Television Heaven]</ref>

====''The Alaskans'' (1959–1960)====
Moore's next television series involved playing the lead as "Silky" Harris for the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] 1959-60 [[Western (genre)|western]] ''[[The Alaskans]]'', with co-stars [[Dorothy Provine]] as "Rocky," [[Jeff York]] as "Reno," and [[Ray Danton]] as "Nifty."  The show ran for a single season of 37 hour-long episodes on Sunday nights. Though set in [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], [[Alaska]], with a focus on the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] circa 1896, the series was filmed in the hot studio lot at Warner Brothers in Hollywood with the cast costumed in fur coats and hats. Moore found the work highly taxing and his off-camera affair with Provine complicated matters even more. He subsequently appeared as the questionable character "14 Karat John" in the two-part episode "Right Off the Boat" of the ABC/WB [[crime drama]] ''[[The Roaring 20s (TV series)|The Roaring 20s]]'', with [[Rex Reason]], [[John Dehner]], [[Gary Vinson]], and again Dorothy Provine, appearing in a similar role but with a different character name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0687270/|title="Right off the Boat", Part 2, ''The Roaring 20s'', May 20, 1961|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}</ref>

====''Maverick'' (1960–1961)====
[[File:Roger Moore Beau Maverick 1960.JPG|right|thumb|Moore as ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'', 1960]]
In the wake of ''The Alaskans'', Moore was cast as [[Maverick (TV series)#Roger Moore as Beau Maverick|Beau Maverick]], an [[Regional accents of English|English-accented]] cousin of frontier gamblers [[Maverick (TV series)#James Garner as Bret Maverick|Bret Maverick]] ([[James Garner]]), [[Maverick (TV series)#Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick|Bart Maverick]] ([[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]]) and [[Maverick (TV series)#Robert Colbert as Brent Maverick|Brent Maverick]] ([[Robert Colbert]]) in the much more successful ABC/WB western series ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]''.  [[Sean Connery]] was flown over from England to test for the part but turned it down.<ref>p.111 Callan, Michael Feeney ''Sean Connery'' 2002 Virgin Publishing</ref>  Moore appeared as the character in 14 episodes after Garner had left the series at the end of the previous season, actually wearing some of Garner's costumes; while filming ''The Alaskans'', he had already recited much of Garner's dialogue since the Klondike series frequently recycled ''Maverick'' scripts, changing only the names and locales.<ref>[http://www.roger-moore.com/sirrogermoore/67.htm Moore answer to a June 2007 question on his official website]</ref> He had also filmed a [[List of Maverick episodes|''Maverick'' episode]] with Garner two seasons earlier in which Moore played a different character in a retooling of  [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s 1775 [[comedy of manners]] play entitled "[[The Rivals]]."

Moore's debut as Beau Maverick occurred in the first episode of the 1960-61 fourth season, "[[List of Maverick episodes#Fourth season (1960-1961)|The Bundle From Britain]]," one of four episodes in which he shared screen time with cousin Bart (Jack Kelly).  [[Robert Altman]] wrote and directed "Bolt from the Blue," an episode featuring [[Will Hutchins]] as a frontier lawyer similar to his character in the series ''[[Sugarfoot]]'', and "Red Dog" found Beau mixed up with vicious bank robbers [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[John Carradine]]. [[Kathleen Crowley]] was Moore's [[leading lady]] in two episodes ("Bullet For the Teacher" and "Kiz"), and others included [[Mala Powers]], [[Roxane Berard]], [[Fay Spain]], [[Merry Anders]], [[Andra Martin]] and [[Jeanne Cooper]]. Upon leaving the series, Moore cited a decline in script quality since the Garner era as the key factor in his decision to depart.

====''The Saint'' (1962–1969)====
[[File:Roger Moore The Saint 1969.JPG|right|thumb|With Earl Green in ''The Saint'']]
Worldwide fame arrived after [[Lew Grade]] cast Moore as [[Simon Templar]] in a new adaptation of ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'', based on the novels by [[Leslie Charteris]]. Moore said in an interview in 1963, that he wanted to buy the rights to Leslie Charteris's character and the trademarks. He also joked that the role was supposed to have been meant for [[Sean Connery]] who was unavailable. The television series was made in the UK with an eye to the American market, and its success there (and in other countries) made Moore a household name. By spring 1967 he had achieved international stardom. The series also established his suave, quipping style which he carried forward to [[James Bond]]. Moore went on to direct several episodes of the later series, which moved into colour in 1967.

''The Saint'' ran from 1962 for six seasons and 118 episodes, making it (in a tie with ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'') the longest-running series of its kind on British television. However, Moore grew increasingly tired of the role, and was keen to branch out. He made two films immediately after the series had ended: ''[[Crossplot (film)|Crossplot]]'', a lightweight 'spy caper' movie, and the more challenging ''[[The Man Who Haunted Himself]]'' (1970). Directed by [[Basil Dearden]], it gave Moore the opportunity to demonstrate a wider versatility than the role of Simon Templar had allowed, although reviews at the time were lukewarm, and both did little business at the box office.

====''The Persuaders!'' (1971–1972)====
Television lured Moore back to star alongside [[Tony Curtis]] in ''[[The Persuaders!]]''. The show featured the adventures of two millionaire playboys across Europe.  Moore was paid the then-unheard-of sum of £1 million for a single series, making him the highest paid television actor in the world. However, Lew Grade claimed in his autobiography ''Still Dancing'', that Moore and Curtis "didn't hit it off all that well." Curtis refused to spend more time on set than was strictly necessary, while Moore was always willing to work overtime.

According to the DVD commentary, neither Roger Moore, an uncredited co-producer, nor Robert S. Baker, the credited producer, ever had a contract other than a handshake with Lew Grade. They produced the entire 24 episodes without a single written word guaranteeing that they would ever be paid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066701/trivia?tr0702967 |title=Roger Moore and Robert S. Baker ever had a contract other than a handshake with Lew Grade. |publisher=imdb.com |date= |accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref>

The series failed in America, where it had been pre-sold to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], but it was successful in Europe and Australia. In Germany, where the series was aired under the name ''Die Zwei'' ("The Two"), it became a hit through especially amusing dubbing which only barely used translations of the original dialogue. In Britain it was also popular, although on its premiere on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, it was beaten in the ratings by repeats of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' on [[BBC One]]. [[Channel 4]] repeated both ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[The Persuaders!]]'' in 1995. Since then, ''[[The Persuaders!]]'' has been issued on DVD, while in France, where the series (entitled ''Amicalement Vôtre'') had always been popular, the DVD releases accompanied a monthly magazine of the same name.

===James Bond era (1973–1985)===

====James Bond films====
[[File:Roger Moore 3 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|Moore in 1973]]
Because of his commitment to several television shows, in particular the long-lasting series ''The Saint'', Roger Moore was unavailable for the James Bond franchise for a considerable time. His participation in ''The Saint'' was not only as actor, but also as a producer and director, and he also became involved in developing the series ''The Persuaders!''. Moore stated in his autobiography ''My Word Is My Bond'' (2008) that he had neither been approached to play James Bond in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', nor does he feel that he had ever been considered. It was only after [[Sean Connery]] had declared in 1966 that he would not play Bond any longer that Moore became aware that he might be a contender for the role. However, after [[George Lazenby]] was cast in 1969's ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' and Connery played Bond again in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971), Moore did not consider the possibility until it seemed abundantly clear that Connery had in fact stepped down as Bond for good. At that point Moore was approached, and he accepted producer [[Albert Broccoli]]'s offer in August 1972. In his autobiography Moore writes that he had to cut his hair and lose weight for the role. Although he resented having to make those changes, he was finally cast as James Bond in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973).

Moore played Bond in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973); ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' (1974); ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977); ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979); ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' (1981); ''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983); and ''[[A View to a Kill]]'' (1985).

Moore is the longest-serving James Bond actor, having spent 12 years in the role (from his debut in 1973, to his retirement from the role in 1985), having made seven official films in a row. Moore is the oldest actor to have played Bond - he was 45 in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973), and 58 when he announced his retirement on 3 December 1985.

Moore's Bond was very different from the version created by [[Ian Fleming]]. Screenwriters like [[George MacDonald Fraser]] provided scenarios in which Moore was cast as a seasoned, debonair playboy who would always have a trick or gadget in stock when he needed it.  This was designed to serve the contemporary taste of the 1970s. Moore's version of Bond was also known for his sense of humour and witty one liners, but also an extremely skilled detective with a cunning mind.

In 2004, Moore was voted 'Best Bond' in an [[Academy Awards]] poll, and he won with 62% of votes in another poll in 2008.  In 1987 he hosted ''Happy Anniversary 007: 25 Years of James Bond''.

====Other films during Bond era====

During Moore's Bond period he starred in 13 other movies, beginning with a thriller featuring [[Susannah York]], entitled ''[[Gold (1974 film)|Gold]]'' (1974). He portrayed an adventurer in Africa opposite [[Lee Marvin]] in ''[[Shout at the Devil (film)|Shout at the Devil]]'' (1976), a commando with [[Richard Burton]] and [[Richard Harris]] in the unorthodox action film ''[[The Wild Geese]]'' (1978), a counter-terrorism expert opposite [[Anthony Perkins]] in the thriller ''[[North Sea Hijack]]'' (1979), and a millionaire so obsessed with Roger Moore that he had had plastic surgery to look like his hero in ''[[The Cannonball Run (film)|Cannonball Run]]'' (1981).  He even made a cameo as Chief Inspector Clouseau, posing as a famous movie star, in ''[[Curse of the Pink Panther]]'' (1983) (for which he was credited as "Turk Thrust II").  However, most of these films were neither critically acclaimed nor commercially successful.  Moore was widely criticised for making three movies in [[South Africa]] under the [[Apartheid]] regime during the 1970s (''Gold'', ''Shout at the Devil'', and ''The Wild Geese'').

===Post-James Bond career (1985–present)===
[[File:Roger Moore at the sets of Sea Wolves.jpg|196px|right|thumb|Roger Moore in 1979]]
Moore did not act onscreen for five years after he stopped playing Bond. In 1990 he appeared in several films and writer-director [[Michael Feeney Callan]]'s television series ''My Riviera''; he starred in the film ''[[Bed & Breakfast (1992 film)|Bed & Breakfast]]'' which was shot in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-17/entertainment/ca-520_1_roger-moore|date=17 September 1989|title=Roger Moore and Talia Shire Take Sequel Break|last=Champlin|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Champlin|publisher=latimes.com}}</ref> At the age of 73, Moore played a flamboyant [[homosexual]] in ''[[Boat Trip (film)|Boat Trip]]'' (2002).

The satirical British TV show ''[[Spitting Image]]'' once had a sketch in which their [[latex]] likeness of Moore, when asked to display emotions by an offscreen director, does nothing but raise an eyebrow. Moore himself has stated that he thought the sketch was funny, and took it in good humour. Indeed, he had always embraced the 'eyebrows' gag wholeheartedly, slyly claiming that he 'only had three expressions as Bond: right eyebrow raised, left eyebrow raised and eyebrows crossed when grabbed by [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]]'. ''Spitting Image'' continued the joke, featuring a Bond movie spoof, ''The Man with the Wooden Delivery'', with Moore's puppet receiving orders from [[Margaret Thatcher]] to kill [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Other comedy shows at that time ridiculed Moore's acting, with [[Rory Bremner]] once claiming to have had a death threat from an irate fan of Moore's, following one such routine.<ref>Bremner, Rory ''Beware of Imitations'' (1999)</ref>

Moore stated that he has retired from acting in an article for ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' magazine on 17 May 2009. In a commercial for London's [[London 2012 Olympic bid|2012 Olympic bid]], Moore appeared alongside [[Samantha Bond]], who played [[Miss Moneypenny]] in the Bond films during the [[Pierce Brosnan]] era.<ref>http://www.sirrogermoore.net/london2012.htm</ref> He still appears regularly on chat shows, chiefly to promote the work of [[UNICEF]].

In 2009, Moore appeared in an advert for the [[Post Office Ltd.|Post Office]].

He also played the role of a secret agent in the ''[[Victoria Wood]] Christmas Special'' on BBC1 show over the festive period in 2009. Filming all his scenes in the [[London Eye]], his mission was to eliminate another agent whose file photo looks just like Pierce Brosnan.

In 2010, Moore provided the voice of a talking cat called [[George Lazenby|Lazenby]] in the film ''[[Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore]]'', which contained several references to, and parodies of, Bond films.

In 2011, Moore co-starred in the film ''A Princess for Christmas'' with Katie McGrath and Sam Heughan. Filming locations included Romania, Peles Castle, Stirbei Castle and Bragadiru Palace.

In 2012, Moore took to the stage for a series of seven ''Evenings With'' in UK theatres and, in November, guest-hosted ''[[Have I Got News for You|Have I Got News For You]]''.

He was named one of  [[GQ]]'s 50 best dressed British men in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=50 Best Dressed Men in Britain 2015|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2015-01/05/best-dressed-men-2015/|work=GQ|date=5 Jan 2015}}</ref>

==Humanitarian work==
Moore's friend [[Audrey Hepburn]] had impressed him with her work for UNICEF, and consequently he became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1991.  He was the voice of Father Christmas or 'Santa' in the 2004 UNICEF cartoon ''The Fly Who Loved Me''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org.uk/theflywholovedme/ |title=The Fly Who Loved Me (directed by Dan Chambers) |publisher=Unicef.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>

In 1952, Moore met the Welsh singer [[Dorothy Squires]], who was 13 years his senior, and Van Steyn and Moore divorced the following year.<ref name=SquiresObit>"Obituary: Dorothy Squires", ''[[The Times]]'', London, 15 April 1998, pg. 21</ref>
Squires and Moore were married in New York and moved to the United States in 1954 to develop their careers; but tensions developed in their marriage due to their age differences and Moore's infatuation with the actress [[Dorothy Provine]], and they moved back to the United Kingdom in 1961.<ref name=SquiresObit/> Squires suffered a series of miscarriages during their marriage and Moore later said the outcome of their marriage might have been different if they had been able to have children.<ref name=SquiresObit/>

In their tempestuous relationship Squires smashed a guitar over his head, and after learning of his affair with the Italian actress Luisa Mattioli, who became Moore's third wife, Moore said that "She threw a brick through my window. She reached through the glass and grabbed my shirt and she cut her arms doing it...The police came and they said, 'Madam, you're bleeding' and she said, 'It's my heart that's bleeding'"<ref name=TelegSep12/> Squires intercepted letters from Mattioli to Moore and planned to include them in her autobiography; but the couple won injunctions against the publication in 1977, which led Squires to unsuccessfully sue them for loss of earnings.<ref name=SquiresObit/> The numerous legal cases launched by Squires led her to be declared a [[vexatious litigant]] in 1988. Moore paid Squires's hospital bills after her cancer treatment in 1996, and upon her death in 2001.<ref name=SquiresOperation>"Moore pays for Squires operation."

Moore had three children with Mattioli; a daughter, [[Deborah Moore|Deborah]] (born 1963) who has become an established actor, and two sons; Geoffrey and Christian.<ref name=ESNov03>{{cite news |url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/moore-saint-or-sinner-7292765.html |title=Roger Moore Saint or Sinner? |last=Cavendish |first=Lucy |work=[[London Evening Standard]] |date=17 November 2003|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> Geoffrey is also an actor,<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0601238 IMDb – Geoffrey Moore]</ref> and appeared alongside his father in the 1976 film ''[[Sherlock Holmes in New York]]'', in later life he co-founded Hush Restaurant in Mayfair, London, with [[Jamie Barber]].<ref name=GuardAug02>{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2002/aug/10/features.jobsmoney1 |title=Yes, the name's bonds |author=Anstead, Mark |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=10 August 2002 |accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> Moore's youngest son, Christian, is a film producer.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1839615 IMDb – Christian Moore]</ref>

===Christina "Kiki" Tholstrup===
Moore and Mattioli separated in 1993 after Moore's affinity with a Swedish born Danish socialite, Christina "Kiki" Tholstrup.<ref name=TelegOct00/> Moore later described his [[prostate cancer]] diagnosis in 1993 as "life-changing", which led him to reassess his life and marriage.<ref name=ESNov03/> Mattioli and Tholstrup had long been friends; but Mattioli was scathing of her in the book she subsequently wrote about her relationship with Moore, ''Nothing Lasts Forever'', describing how she felt betrayed by Tholstrup and discarded by Moore.<ref name=TelegOct00/><ref name=ESNov03/> In her book Mattioli wrote that she felt Tholstrup had "wanted to become me" and also described her as "a hanger-on who has had two husbands and three facelifts".<ref name=TelegOct00/>

Moore remained silent on his divorce from Mattioli, later saying that he did not wish to hurt his children by "engaging in a war of words".<ref name=ESNov03/> Moore's children refused to speak to him for a period after the divorce, but they were later reconciled with their father.<ref name=ESNov03/> Mattioli refused to grant Moore a divorce until 2000, when a £10 million settlement was agreed.<ref>James Bone. "Roger Moore's £10m divorce." ''[[The Times]]'', London, 10 October 2000</ref> Moore subsequently married Tholstrup in 2002.<ref name=ESNov03/> Moore would later say that he loved Tholstrup as she was "organised", "serene", "loving" and "calm", saying that "I have a difficult life. I rely on Kristina totally. When we are travelling for my job she is the one who packs. Kristina takes care of all that."<ref name=ESNov03/> Moore also said that his marriage to Tholstrop was "a tranquil relationship, there are no arguments."<ref name=TelegNov13/>

===Political alignment===

Moore is a lifelong supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], and he publicly endorsed the party during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election campaign]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000549/bio Roger Moore. Biography] IMDb</ref> In 2011, Moore gave his support to Conservative Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] on his policy on the [[European Union]], stating: "I think he's doing absolutely wonderfully well, despite the opposition from many members of his own party. Traitors, I call them. I mean any hardliner within the Conservative Party who speaks out against their leader. You should support your leader."<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/sir-roger-moore-ive-paid-my-dues-in-taxes/255299 | title= Sir Roger Moore: 'I've paid my dues in taxes'}}</ref>

===Residence===

He used to own mansions in the UK but now he varies his time between his chalet in Switzerland and apartment in Monaco.

==Tax exile==
Moore became a [[tax exile]] from the United Kingdom in 1978, originally to Switzerland, and currently divides his year between his three homes; an apartment in [[Monte Carlo]], [[Monaco]], a chalet in [[Crans-Montana]], [[Switzerland]] and a home in the south of France.<ref name=TelegNov13>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/10381403/Roger-Moore-interview-If-I-had-24-hours-to-live-Id-make-a-dry-martini.html |title=Roger Moore interview: 'If I had 24 hours to live, I'd make a dry martini' |first=Veronica |last=Lee |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=26 October 2003|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=TelegAug14>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/jamesbond/11065466/Sir-Roger-Moore-I-cant-drink-martinis-any-more-but-life-is-bliss.html |author=Julia Llewelyn Smith |title=Sir Roger Moore: 'I can't drink martinis any more – but life is bliss' |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=30 April 2014 |accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> Moore is a notable resident of Monaco, having been appointed a Goodwill Ambassador of Monaco by [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert II]] for his efforts in internationally promoting and publicizing the principality.<ref name='MonPal'>{{cite web|title=Monaco Ambassador's Club - News|url=http://www.palais.mc/en/news/h-s-h-prince-albert-ii/event/2012/june/monaco-ambassadors-club-2807.html|work=Monaco Ambassadors Club|publisher=Prince's Palace of Monaco|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref> Moore has been scathing of the Russian population in Monaco, saying that "I'm afraid we're overstuffed with Russians. All the restaurant menus are in Russian now.”<ref name=TelegAug14/>

Moore has been vocal in his defence of his tax status, saying that in the 1970s he had been urged by his "accountants, agents and lawyers" that moving abroad was essential due to the fact that "...you would never be able to save enough to ensure that you had any sort of livelihood if you didn't work" as a result of the punitive taxation rates imposed on unearned income.<ref name=TelegSep12>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/9574135/Roger-Moore-I-love-cash.-The-sheer-luxury-of-crispy-1-notes.html |first=Nick |last=McGrath |title=Roger Moore: 'I love cash.
