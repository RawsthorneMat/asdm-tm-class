'''Joan Dixon''' (June 6, 1930 in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] &ndash; February 20, 1992 in [[Los Angeles]]) was an American film and television actress in the 1950s. She is known for her role  in the [[film noir]], ''[[Roadblock (1951 movie)|Roadblock]]'' (1951).

==Life and career==
Dixon's career, while under contract at [[RKO Pictures]], was in the hands of [[Howard Hughes]]. He attempted but failed to make her into the star he made of [[Jane Russell]] (whom Dixon resembled). Hughes had personal contracts with Dixon, Russell, and [[Janis Carter]].

In September 1952, it was revealed that Hughes had an agreement with the Ralph E. Stolkin syndicate to lend RKO Pictures the sum of $8,000,000. The loan commitment was made as part of a sales accord following losses sustained by RKO in the previous two years. Earlier Hughes controlled RKO-Radio studio.

Joan eloped and married [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] camera manufacturer Theodore (Ted) Briskin in October 1952. Briskin was formerly the husband of [[Betty Hutton]], having married and divorced her twice. Dixon and Briskin were married in a surprise ceremony in the wedding chapel of the [[Flamingo Hotel]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]]. She was 23 and he was 35. Their marriage lasted but three weeks, with Miss Dixon leaving Briskin in early November 1952. She was later married to writer William Dixon, but they divorced in 1959.

The actress appeared in ten films (mostly westerns) and appeared on a few television programs. Her television appearances include episodes of  ''The Ford Television Theater'' (1957) and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' (1956).

She also performed as a vocalist at Dino's Lodge in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in December 1960.

She died on February 20, 1992, in Los Angeles at age 61.
