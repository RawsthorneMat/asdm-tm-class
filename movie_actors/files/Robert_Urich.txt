==Career==

===1970s-1980s===
Urich made his television debut in a guest starring role in ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', in 1972. The following year, he won a lead role in ''[[Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (TV series)|Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice]]''. The series was an adaptation of the [[Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice|1969 film of the same name]]. ''Bob & Carol...'' struggled in the ratings and was canceled after six episodes.

In 1975, Urich was cast in the action/crime drama series ''[[S.W.A.T. (TV series)|S.W.A.T.]]''. According to the series' executive producer [[Aaron Spelling]], Urich's friend [[Burt Reynolds]] convinced Spelling to allow Urich to read for the part. Spelling was impressed with Urich's reading and cast him in the role of "Officer Jim Street".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spelling|first1=Aaron|last2=Graham|first2=Jefferson |title=Aaron Spelling: A Prime-Time Life|year=2002|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-31344-6|page=86}}</ref> A [[mid-season replacement]], ''S.W.A.T.'' earned high enough ratings to warrant a second season. However, the series was canceled in 1976 due to its violent content.<ref>{{cite book|last=McNab|first=Chris |title=Deadly Force: Firearms and American Law Enforcement, from the Wild West to the Streets of Today|year=2009|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-846-03376-4|page=126}}</ref>

Urich's next role was on the sitcom ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' as Peter the Tennis Player in 1977. That same year he was cast as Paul Thurston, a good-looking, ego driven talk show host in the ''[[Bewitched]]'' spin-off series ''[[Tabitha (TV series)|Tabitha]]'', starring [[Lisa Hartman]]. The show's rating were initially strong, but schedule changes caused ratings to drop and the series was canceled in 1978 after 13 episodes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leszczak|first=Bob |title=Single Season Sitcoms, 1948-1979: A Complete Guide|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-49305-4|page=178}}</ref> Shortly after ''Tabitha'' was canceled, Urich was cast in another Aaron Spelling produced series ''[[Vega$]]''. He portrayed the series' lead character, Dan Tanna, a private detective who solves crimes in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. The series was a hit for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and Urich received two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for his work on the series. By the series' third season, however, Urich had grown tired of the role and complained about the declining quality of the writing. Ratings had also declined and the series was canceled in 1981. Shortly after ''Vega$'' was canceled, Urich signed with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and decided to focus on his film career. His first film for Metro was ''[[Endangered Species (1982 film)|Endangered Species]]'' (1982), a science fiction film directed by [[Alan Rudolph]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eu9DAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y68MAAAAIBAJ&pg=1403,3390998&dq=robert+urich+vegas+canceled&hl=en|title=Snubbing TV Offers...Robert Urich Wants Movies Only|last=Scott|first=Vernon|date=February 19, 1982|work=The Durant Daily Democrat|page=7|accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref>

Shortly after filming ''Endangered Species'', Urich signed on to star in another series ''[[Gavilan (TV series)|Gavilan]]''. Urich starred as the title character who was a former CIA agent turned [[oceanographer]]. ''Gavilan'' was canceled after seven episodes. In 1984, he starred in two more films ''[[The Ice Pirates]]'', and [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[Invitation to Hell (1984 film)|Invitation to Hell]]''. The following year, Urich co-starred in ''[[Turk 182]]''. The film was a box office failure and Urich was nominated for [[Golden Raspberry Award]].

In 1985, Urich returned to episodic television as the title character in ''[[Spenser: For Hire]]''. The series was another hit for Urich and aired for three seasons. He reprised the role in several television films after the series was canceled: ''Spenser: Ceremony'' (1993), ''Spenser: Pale Kings and Princes'' (1994), ''Spenser: The Judas Goat'' (1994), and ''Spenser: A Savage Place'' (1995). In 1988, Urich began hosting the documentary series ''[[National Geographic Explorer]]''. He won a [[CableACE Award]] for his work on the series. In 1989, he portrayed [[Jake Spoon]], in the acclaimed television miniseries ''[[Lonesome Dove (TV miniseries)|Lonesome Dove]]'', a role for which he received many positive reviews.

===1990s–2000s===
In the 1990s, Urich mainly appeared in television films and several short-lived television series. From 1990 to 1991, he starred in the sitcom ''[[American Dreamer (TV series)|American Dreamer]]''. The following year, he starred in ''[[Crossroads (1992 TV series)|Crossroads]]'', a drama series that aired on ABC for ten episodes. In 1993, he and [[Faye Dunaway]] starred in the sitcom ''[[It Had to Be You (TV series)|It Had to Be You]]''. The series was critically panned and canceled after four episodes. In 1995, Urich narrated an extremely rare one-night showing of a Disney television documentary called "Alien Encounters:From New Tomorrowland". It has never been shown again. In 1996, Urich starred in the [[TNT (TV channel)|TNT]] Western series ''[[The Lazarus Man]]''. The series earned strong enough ratings to be picked up for a second season but shortly after the series was renewed, Urich announced he had been diagnosed with [[synovial cell sarcoma]]. The series' production company, [[Castle Rock Entertainment]], opted to cancel the series due to Urich's illness.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim |author2=Marsh, Earle F. |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present |publisher=Ballantine Books|date=October 17, 2007|edition=9|page=776|isbn=0-345-49773-2}}</ref> In 1999, Urich commented on Castle Rock's choice to end the series, "There's really a law against what they did. They found out I had cancer, and they just canceled the show. They didn't ask the doctors if I could work. They didn't ask if I could go back to work."<ref name="pittsburgh">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0ulRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IXADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6620,690350&dq=robert+urich+love+boat&hl=en|title=Second Chances|last=Thomas|first=George M.|date=November 3, 1999|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> In 2000, he sued Castle Rock for [[breach of contract]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LplXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YPIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6232,1807875&dq=lazarus+man+robert+urich&hl=en|title=Urich suing over 'Lazarus Man'|date=April 14, 2000|work=The Spokesman-Review|page=D2|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}</ref> The lawsuit was later settled with both parties agreeing not to publicly disclose the terms of the settlement.<ref name="portsmouth">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eqVFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rM8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=5651,2674233&dq=robert+urich+cancer&hl=en|title=Actor Robert Urich dies from cancer at age 55|last=Elber|first=Lynn|date=April 18, 2002|work=Portsmouth Daily Times|page=B5|accessdate=January 4, 2013}}</ref>
