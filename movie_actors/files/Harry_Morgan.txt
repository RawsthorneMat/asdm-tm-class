==Early life and career==
Morgan was born in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in 1915, the son of Hannah and Henry Bratsberg,<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="academy2008"/> who were of [[Sweden|Swedish]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite news |title=Harry Morgan, Colonel Potter on Landmark TV Show ‘M*A*S*H,’ Is Dead at 96 |url=http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-07/harry-morgan-colonel-potter-on-landmark-tv-show-m-a-s-h-is-dead-at-96?category=%2Fleaders%2F |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |author=Arnold, Laurence |date=December 7, 2011}}</ref>  In his interview with the Archive of American Television, Morgan spelled his Norwegian family surname as "Bratsberg".<ref name="academy2008"/> Many sources, however, including some family records, list the spelling as "Bratsburg". According to one source, when Morgan's father Henry registered at junior high school, "the registrar spelled it Bratsburg instead of Bratsberg. Bashful Henry did not demur."<ref name="arnell">{{Cite book |title=Motion Picture |last=Arnell |first=Bob |year=1946 |url= http://books.google.com/books?ei=axXgTrTfG8WsiAL8_6mWDw&ct=result&id=mfIKAQAAMAAJ |postscript={{nbsp}}"Henry Morgan". |publisher=[[Bartell Media Corporation|Macfadden/Bartell]] |via=''[[Motion Picture (magazine)|Motion Picture magazine]]'' |volume=v.72 |page=196}}</ref>

Morgan was reared in [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], Michigan, and graduated from [[Muskegon High School]] in 1933, where he achieved distinction as a statewide debating champion.<ref>[http://www.muskegon.k12.mi.us/mhs/DistinguishedGrads/DistinguishedGrads.html Muskegon High School Distinguished Graduates]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> He originally aspired to a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree, but began acting while a junior at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1935.

He began acting on stage under his birth name, in 1937, joining the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] in [[New York City]] formed by [[Harold Clurman]], [[Cheryl Crawford]], and [[Lee Strasberg]] in 1931.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinewoodlake.org/ |title=Pinewood Lake website |publisher=Pinewoodlake.org |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>Images of America, Trumbull Historical Society, 1997, p. 123.</ref> He appeared in the original production of the [[Clifford Odets]] play ''[[Golden Boy (play)|Golden Boy]]'', followed by a host of successful Broadway roles alongside such other Group members such as [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Sanford Meisner]], and [[Karl Malden]]. Morgan also did [[summer stock]] at the [[Pine Brook Country Club]] located in the countryside of [[Nichols, Connecticut]].

==Film work==
[[File:Harry Morgan Cara Williams Pete and Gladys 1960.JPG|left|thumb|With [[Cara Williams]] in ''[[Pete and Gladys]]'']]
Morgan made his screen debut (originally using the name "Henry Morgan") in the 1942 movie ''[[To the Shores of Tripoli]]''. His screen name later would become "Henry 'Harry' Morgan" and eventually Harry Morgan, to avoid confusion with the popular [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|humorist of the same name]].

In the same year, Morgan appeared in the movie ''[[Orchestra Wives]]'' as a young man pushing his way to the front of a ballroom crowd with his date to hear [[Glenn Miller]]'s band play. A few years later, still credited as Henry Morgan, he was cast in the role of pianist [[Chummy MacGregor]] in the 1954 [[biopic]] ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]''.

Morgan continued to play a number of significant roles on the big screen in such films as ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'' (1943); ''[[Wing and a Prayer]]'' (1944); ''[[Dragonwyck (film)|Dragonwyck]]'' (1946); ''[[The Big Clock]]'' (1948); ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952); and several films in the 1950s for director [[Anthony Mann]], including ''[[Bend of the River]]'' (1952); ''[[Thunder Bay (film)|Thunder Bay]]'' (1953); ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'' (1954); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1955) and ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'' (1955). In his later film career, he appeared in ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]'' (1960); ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962) (as [[Ulysses S. Grant]]); ''[[John Goldfarb, Please Come Home]]'' (1965); ''[[Frankie and Johnny (1966 film)|Frankie and Johnny]]'' (1966); ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'' (1969); ''[[Support Your Local Gunfighter!]]'' (1971); ''[[Snowball Express]]'' (1972); ''[[The Shootist]]'' (1976); ''[[The Wild Wild West Revisited]]'' (1979); and as Captain Gannon in the film version of ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'' (1987) with [[Dan Aykroyd]] and [[Tom Hanks]].

==Radio and television==
Morgan hosted the NBC radio series ''Mystery in the Air'' starring [[Peter Lorre]] in 1947. On [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]], he played Pete Porter in ''[[Pete and Gladys]]'' (1960–1962), with [[Cara Williams]] as wife Gladys. ''Pete and Gladys'' was a [[Spin-off (media)|spinoff]] of ''[[December Bride]]'' (1954–1959), starring [[Spring Byington]], a show in which Morgan had a popular recurring role.  In 1950, Morgan appeared as an obtrusive, alcohol-addled hotel clerk in the ''Dragnet'' radio episode "The Big Boys".

==1960s: ''Dragnet'' and other roles==
[[File:Jack Webb Harry Morgan Dragnet 1968.JPG|thumb|200px|Morgan with Jack Webb in ''Dragnet''.]]
After ''Pete and Gladys'' ended production, Morgan guest starred in the role of Al Everett in the 1962 episode "Like My Own Brother" on [[Gene Kelly]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] drama series, ''[[Going My Way (TV series)|Going My Way]]'', loosely based on the 1944 [[Bing Crosby]] [[Going My Way|film]] of the same name. That same year he played the mobster [[Bugs Moran]] in an episode of ABC's ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', with [[Robert Stack]]. In 1963, he was cast as Sheriff Ernie Backwater on [[Richard Boone]]'s ''[[Have Gun - Will Travel]]'' [[Western (genre)|western]] series on CBS.

In the 1964–1965 season, Morgan co-starred as Seldom Jackson in the 26-week NBC comedy/drama ''[[Kentucky Jones]]'', starring [[Dennis Weaver]], formerly of ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.

Morgan is even more widely recognized as Officer [[Dragnet (series)|Bill Gannon]], [[Joe Friday]]'s partner in the revived version of ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'' (1967–1970).

Morgan had also appeared with ''Dragnet'' star [[Jack Webb]] in two [[film noir]] movies, ''[[Dark City (1950 film)|Dark City]]'' (1950) and ''[[Appointment with Danger]]'' (1951), and was an early regular member of Jack Webb's stock company of actors on the original ''Dragnet'' radio show. Morgan later worked on two other shows for Webb: 1971's ''[[The D.A. (1971 TV series)|The D.A.]]'' and the 1972–1974 western series,  ''[[Hec Ramsey]].'' Morgan also appeared in at least one episode of ''Gunsmoke''.

==1970s: ''M*A*S*H''==
[[File:MASH TV cast 1975.JPG|left|thumb|200px|As Colonel Potter in ''M*A*S*H'' with [[Alan Alda]] and [[Mike Farrell]]]]
After his contract with Mark VII had expired in 1974, Morgan's first appearance on ''M*A*S*H'' was in the show's third season (1974–1975), when he played eccentric Major General Bartford Hamilton Steele in "[[List of M*A*S*H episodes (season 3)|The General Flipped at Dawn]]", which originally aired on September 10, 1974.

The following season, Morgan joined the cast of ''M*A*S*H'' for his co-starring role as [[Sherman T. Potter|Colonel Sherman T. Potter]]. A fan of the sitcom, Morgan replaced [[McLean Stevenson]], who had left the show at the end of the previous season. Unlike Stevenson's character Henry Blake, Potter was a career Army officer who was a firm yet good-humored, caring father figure to the people under his command.

In 1980, Morgan won an Emmy award for his performance on ''M*A*S*H''. When asked if he was a better actor after working with the show's talented cast, Morgan responded, "I don't know about that, but it's made me a better human being."<ref>Elber, Lynn: [http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9RGEV8O0.htm "Harry Morgan made small roles big in TV, movies"] Associated Press, December 8, 2011</ref> After the end of the series, Morgan reprised the Potter role in a short-lived spinoff series, ''[[AfterMASH]]''.

Morgan also kept busy appearing in several Disney movies throughout the decade, including ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]'', ''[[Snowball Express]]'', ''[[Charley and the Angel]]'', ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'', ''[[The Cat from Outer Space]]'' (opposite McLean Stevenson) and ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]''.

==Later years==
In 1986, he costarred with [[Hal Linden]] in ''[[Blacke's Magic]]'', a show about a magician who doubled as a detective solving unusual crimes. The series lasted only one season.  Morgan's character, Leonard Blacke, was a semiretired con artist.

In 1979, Morgan played Mr. DePinna in a TV  version of [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Moss Hart]]'s Pulitzer Prize-winning play ''[[You Can't Take It With You]]''.  He also played the lead role of Martin Vanderhoff in a short-lived series based on the same play, in 1987.  He was given a supporting role in John Wayne's last film, ''The Shootist'', in 1976, playing the town lawman who cheered Wayne's character's forthcoming demise from cancer.

In 1987, Morgan reprised his Bill Gannon character, now a [[police captain|captain]], for a supporting role in another [[Dragnet (1987 film)|film version of ''Dragnet'']], a parody of the original series written by and starring [[Dan Aykroyd]] and co-starring [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Christopher Plummer]].

In the 1990s Morgan starred alongside [[Walter Matthau]] in a series of television movies for CBS as Stoddard Bell, a judge who is an acquaintance/nemesis/partner of Matthau's Harmon Cobb, an attorney (''[[The Incident (TV movie)|The Incident]]'';  ''[[Against Her Will: An Incident in Baltimore (TV 1992)]]'', and ''[[Incident in a Small Town (1994 TV)]]''). He also lent his voice to an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' from season seven, where he once again played Bill Gannon; in the episode "[[Mother Simpson]]", Gannon and Joe Friday (voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]) are FBI agents trying to track down Homer's mother, who is a fugitive from justice.

Morgan also had a recurring role on ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'' as Professor Suter, a colleague of Dick Solomon's. Morgan directed episodes for several TV series, including two episodes of ''[[The Alfred Hitchcock Hour]]'', two episodes of ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', one episode of ''[[Adam-12]]'', and eight episodes of ''M*A*S*H''. Morgan had a guest role on ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]'' as Raymond and a guest role on ''[[Grace Under Fire (TV series)|Grace Under Fire]]'' as Jean's pot-smoking boyfriend.

In 2006, Morgan was inducted into the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]].

==Personal life==
Morgan was married first to Eileen Detchon from 1940 until her death in 1985. During Morgan's time on ''M*A*S*H'', a photograph of Detchon regularly appeared on the desk of his character.  A drawing of a horse, seen on the wall behind Potter's desk, was drawn by Morgan's grandson, Jeremy Morgan. In addition, Eileen was the name of the wife of Officer Bill Gannon on ''Dragnet''. Morgan had four sons with his first wife: Christopher, Charles, Paul, and Daniel (who died in 1989).

He then married Barbara Bushman Quine (granddaughter of silent film star [[Francis X. Bushman]]) on December 17, 1986; the marriage lasted until his death. In July 1997, Morgan was charged with abusing his wife a year earlier, after a beating left her with injuries to her eye, foot, and arm.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/Actor_Harry_Morgan_Arrested/33401 |last=Errico |first=Marcus |title=Actor Harry Morgan Arrested |work=[[E!]] |date=July 11, 1996}}</ref> Prosecutors dropped the charges after the 82-year-old actor completed a six-month domestic violence counseling program.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-26/news/mn-7127_1_harry-morgan |title='MASH' Star's Abuse Case Is Dismissed |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 26, 1997}}</ref>

Morgan had two siblings, Marguerite and Arnold (both deceased).

Morgan was close friends with bandleader [[Glenn Miller]], whom he met while filming ''[[Orchestra Wives]]'' in 1942, until Miller's death two years later. Morgan even starred in the 1954 movie about his friend, ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'', playing [[Chummy MacGregor]]. Morgan's son led the [[Glenn Miller Orchestra (1946-present)|Glenn Miller Orchestra]] for some years.

==Death==
Morgan died peacefully in his sleep at 3:00 am in Los Angeles, on December 7, 2011, at the age of 96.<ref name="nytobit">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/arts/television/harry-morgan-mash-and-dragnet-actor-dies-at-96.html |title=Harry Morgan, Colonel Potter on ‘M*A*S*H,’ Dies at 96 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 7, 2011 |first=Michael |last=Pollak}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ulaby|first=Neda|title=Harry Morgan, M*A*S*H's Col.

{{Quote|He was a wonderful man, a fabulous actor and a dear and close friend since the first day we worked together. As Alan [Alda] said, he did not have an unadorable bone in his body... He was a treasure as a person, an imp at times, and always a true professional. He had worked with the greats and never saw himself as one of them. But he was... He was the rock everyone depended on and yet he could cut up like a kid when the situation warranted it. He was the apotheosis, the finest example of what people call a ‘character actor’. What he brought to the work made everyone better. He made those who are thought of as ‘stars’ shine even more brightly... The love and admiration we all felt for him were returned tenfold in many, many ways. And the greatest and most selfless tribute to the experience we enjoyed was paid by Harry at the press conference when our show ended. He remarked that someone had asked him if working on ''M*A*S*H'' had made him a better actor. He responded by saying, 'I don’t know about that, but it made me a better human being.' It’s hard to imagine a better one.}}
