'''Ernst Wilhelm "Wim" Wenders''' ({{IPA-de|vɪm vɛndəɐs}}; born 14 August 1945) is a German [[filmmaker]], [[playwright]], [[author]], [[photographer]], and a major figure in [[New German Cinema]]. In a career spanning over four decades, he has received some of the highest international film awards, including the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1984 Cannes Film Festival]] for his drama ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]; ''the [[Golden Lion]] for the drama ''[[The State of Things (film)|The State of Things]]'' at the [[Venice Film Festival]] ([[1984 in film|1982]]); and Best Director for the romantic fantasy film ''[[Wings of Desire]]'' at the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival]]. He has been nominated for [[the Academy Awards]] three times, for his documentaries ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'', about the music of Cuba, ''[[Pina (film)|Pina]]'', about the contemporary dance choreographer [[Pina Bausch]], and ''[[The Salt of the Earth (2014 film)|The Salt of the Earth]]'', about Brazilian photographer [[Sebastião Salgado]]. Since 1996, Wenders has been the president of the [[European Film Academy]] in Berlin.

Alongside filmmaking, Wenders works with the medium of photography, emphasizing images of desolate landscapes.<ref name="theguardian1">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2011/apr/23/wim-wenders-photographs |title=Wim Wenders: Places, Strange And Quiet – in pictures &#124; Art and design |publisher=Theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref><ref name="telegraph ">{{cite web|author=Art Photography |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/photography/8415621/Wim-Wenders-Show-dont-tell.html |title=Wim Wenders: Show, don't tell |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>

==Early life==
Wenders was born in [[Düsseldorf]] into a traditional Catholic family. His father, Heinrich Wenders, was a surgeon. The use of the Dutch name "Wim", a shortened version of the baptismal name "Wilhelm/Willem", reflected his mother's Dutch provenance, but the Dutch version was rejected by the civil registration authorities in 1945 as "un-German".<ref name="IMDb">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000694/bio |title=Wim Wenders Bio |publisher=IMDb.com |accessdate=2015-05-03}}</ref> As a boy, he took unaccompanied trips to Amsterdam to visit the [[Rijksmuseum]]. He graduated from high school in [[Oberhausen]] in the [[Ruhr area]]. He then studied medicine (1963–64) and philosophy (1964–65) in [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] and [[Düsseldorf]]. However, he dropped out of university studies and moved to Paris in October 1966 to become a painter. Wenders failed his entry test at France's national film school [[IDHEC]] (now [[La Fémis]]), and instead became an engraver in the studio of [[Johnny Friedlaender|Johnny Friedlander]], in [[Montparnasse]]. During this time, Wenders became fascinated with cinema, and saw up to five movies a day at the local movie theater.

Set on making his obsession also his life's work, Wenders returned to Germany in 1967 to work in the Düsseldorf office of [[United Artists]]. That fall, he entered the "Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film München" ([[University of Television and Film Munich]]). Between 1967 and 1970 while at the "HFF", Wenders also worked as a film critic for ''FilmKritik'', then the Munich daily newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''Twen'' magazine, and ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.

Wenders completed several short films before graduating from the Hochschule with a feature-length 16mm black and white film, ''[[Summer in the City (film)|Summer in the City]]''.

==Career==
Wenders began his career during the [[New German Cinema]] era of the late 1960s, making his feature directorial debut with ''[[Summer in the City (film)|Summer in the City]]'' (1970). Much of the distinctive [[cinematography]] in his movies is the result of a highly productive long-term collaboration with Dutch cinematographer [[Robby Müller]]. Some of his more successful and critically acclaimed movies, ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'' and ''[[Wings of Desire]]'', for example, have been the result of fruitful collaborations with ''avant-garde'' authors [[Peter Handke]] and [[Sam Shepard]]. Handke's novel, ''[[The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick]]'' was adapted for Wenders' second feature film, ''[[The Goalkeeper's Fear of the Penalty]].'' Handke co-wrote the script for ''[[Wings of Desire]]'' and ''[[Until the End of the World]]'', both featuring [[Solveig Dommartin]].

Wenders has directed several highly acclaimed documentaries, most notably ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1999), about Cuban musicians, and ''[[The Soul of a Man]]'' (2003), on American blues. He has also directed a documentary style film on the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]], known in English as ''A Trick of the Light''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0113151|A Trick of the Light}}</ref> The Skladanowsky brothers were inventing 'moving pictures' when several others like the Lumiere brothers and Friese-Greene were doing the same.

He has also directed many music videos for groups such as [[U2]] and [[Talking Heads]], including "[[Stay (Faraway, So Close!)]]" and "[[Sax and Violins]]".  His television commercials include a UK advertisement for [[Carling O'Keefe|Carling Premier]] Canadian beer.

[[Image:Wim Wenders(cannesPhotocall)-.jpg|thumb|250px|Wim Wenders at [[Cannes]] (2002)]]
Wenders' book, ''Emotion Pictures'', a collection of diary essays written while a film student, was adapted and broadcast as a series of plays on [[BBC Radio 3]], featuring Peter Capaldi as Wenders, with [[Gina McKee]], [[Saskia Reeves]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]] and [[Ricky Tomlinson]], dramatised by Neil Cargill.

Wenders was collaborating with artist/journalist and longtime friend [[Melinda Camber Porter]] on a documentary feature about his body of work, ''Wim Wenders - Visions on Film'', when Porter passed away - the film remains incomplete.

Wenders is a member of the advisory board of [[World Cinema Foundation]]. The project was founded by [[Martin Scorsese]] and aimed at finding and reconstructing world cinema films that have been long neglected.  He serves as a Jury Member for the digital studio [[Filmaka]], a platform for undiscovered filmmakers to show their work to industry professionals.<ref name="Filmaka">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmaka.com/profile_jury_favfilms.php?profile_id=5684 |title=Profile Jury |publisher=Filmaka.com |date=1945-08-14 |accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>

[[Image:Wim wenders.jpg|thumb|250px|Wim Wenders (2008)]]
In 2011 he was selected to stage the 2013 cycle of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' at the [[Bayreuth Festival]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.german-info.com/press_shownews.php?pid=3312 |title=German Information Centre South Asia &#124; Facebook |publisher=German-info.com |date=2015-03-08 |accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref> a reflection of his capacity to produce imaginative tributes to great works of art.<ref>[http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2011/03/what_wim_wenders_may_be_planni.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> The project fell through when he insisted on filming in [[Stereoscopy|3-D]], which the Wagner family found too costly and disruptive.<ref>[http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2011/04/breaking_bayreuth_loses_its_ne.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>

While promoting his 3-D dance film, ''[[Pina (film)|Pina]]'', Wenders told the [[DOC: The Documentary Channel|Documentary channel]] Blog in December 2011 that he has already begun work on a new 3-D documentary, this one about architecture.<ref name="Documentary Channel Blog">[http://blog.documentarychannel.com/post/14625054063/interview-wim-wenders-on-pina-and-why-3d-is-the] {{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> He also has said that he will only be working in the 3-D film format from now on.<ref name="WSJ Speakeasy">{{cite web|author= |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/12/23/its-3d-or-bust-for-pina-director-wim-wenders/ |title=It’s 3D or Bust for ‘Pina’ Director Wim Wenders - Speakeasy - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2011-12-23 |accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref> Wenders admired the dance choreographer [[Pina Bausch]] since 1985, but only with the advent of digital 3-D cinema did he decide that he could sufficiently capture her work on screen.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Photography==
Alongside filmmaking, Wim Wenders works with the medium of photography and his poignant images of desolate landscapes engage themes including memory, time, loss, nostalgia and movement.<ref name="theguardian1"/><ref name="telegraph "/> Wenders’ long-running artistic project, Pictures from the Surface of the Earth, began in the early 1980s and was subsequently pursued by the artist for the next twenty years. The initial photographic series in this body of work was titled Written in the West which Wenders produced when criss-crossing through the American West in preparation for his film Paris, Texas (1984). This became the starting point for the artist’s nomadic journey across the globe, travelling through countries including Germany, Australia, Cuba, Israel and Japan to take photographs which capture the essence of a moment, place or space.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rose |first=Barbara |url=http://brooklynrail.org/2004/01/artseen/wim-wenders-pictures-from-the-surface-of-the-earth |title=Wim Wenders: Pictures From the Surface of the Earth |publisher=Brooklynrail.org |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2015-03-17}}</ref>
