Hill]], director and [[cinematographer]] of numerous silent movies and early sound films in the 1920s and early 1930s.  He was educated at [[The Blake School (Minneapolis, Minnesota)|The Blake School]], one of Minnesota's most prestigious private schools,<ref name="Telegraph"/> and at [[Yale University]], class of 1943. 

He had a love of flying. After school, he liked to visit the airport and his hobby was to memorize the records of [[World War I]] flying aces.<ref name="NY Times"/> He idolized [[United States|U.S.]] pilot Speed Holman<ref>The New York Times misspelled this name as "Homan" in their December 28, 2002 edition but corrected it to "Holman" on December 31, 2002</ref> who, Hill once explained, "used to make his approach to the spectators at state fairs flying past the grandstand upside down."<ref name="NY Times"/> Hill obtained his [[Aviator|pilot]]’s licence at the age of 16.<ref name="Times"/> Airplanes featured prominently in his later films and are frequently crashed as well &mdash; in ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five (film)|Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', ''[[The World According to Garp (film)|The World According to Garp]]'' and especially ''[[The Great Waldo Pepper]]'' which showed the influence on Hill of pilots like Speed Holman. 

Hill also loved [[classical music]], especially [[Bach]]<ref name="Times"/>  and as an undergraduate at [[Yale University]] studied music under notable composer [[Paul Hindemith]], graduating in 1943.<ref name="Telegraph"/> His film [[The World of Henry Orient]] contains a humorous spoof-like tease of Hindemith during the piano concerto scene of Henry Orient ([[Peter Sellers]]) in performance. While at Yale, Hill was a member of the [[Scroll & Key]] Society and of the [[The Spizzwinks(?)]] and [[The Whiffenpoofs]], America's oldest collegiate a cappella singing group.

== Military service ==

During [[World War II]], Hill served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a cargo pilot in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|South Pacific]].<ref name="Telegraph"/> 

The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] resulted in his recall to active duty service for 18 months as a night fighter pilot, emerging with the rank of major.<ref name="Telegraph"/> He was stationed at the [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]] jet flight-training center in [[North Carolina]].<ref name="NY Times"/>

==Career ==
After the war, Hill worked as a newspaper reporter in [[Texas]], then took advantage of the [[GI Bill]] to do graduate work at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in [[Ireland]] on [[James Joyce]]'s use of music in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.<ref name="Telegraph"/> Some sources say he graduated in 1949 with a [[Bachelor's degree]] in literature.<ref name="CBSobit">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/27/entertainment/main534537.shtml

===Theater===
On his return to the [[United States|U.S.]], Hill acted [[Off Broadway]] and toured with [[Margaret Webster]]'s [[Shakespeare]] [[Repertory]] Company.<ref name=hr>{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Actress Louisa Horton Hill dies, 87 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/features/people/deaths/e3i6d8dd35ae941f0613907e0537e7890e9 |agency= Associated Press |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2008-02-15 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="NY Times"/> He then appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' and [[August Strindberg]]'s ''The Creditors'' with [[Bea Arthur]].<ref name="Telegraph"/> In 1952, he featured in a supporting role in the [[Hollywood]] movie ''Walk East on Beacon'',<ref name="Telegraph"/> but was then recalled to military service.<ref name="NY Times"/>

===Television ===
Hill used his Korean War experience as the basis for a TV drama, "My Brother's Keeper," which appeared on [[Kraft Television Theater]], with Hill himself in the cast. During his military service at Cherry Point, he had had to be 'talked down' by a ground controller at [[Atlanta]] airport, an incident that led to his writing the [[screenplay]]. The episode was performed and transmitted live in 1953.<ref name="Times"/> After his [[demobilisation]], he joined the company as a writer, later becoming a director of various Kraft episodes.<ref name="Telegraph"/> He won an [[Emmy]] for writing and directing a TV version of ''[[A Night to Remember (1958 film)|A Night to Remember]]'', the story of the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]].<ref name="Times"/>

===Return to theatre===
After service and time in [[television]], Hill returned to Broadway in 1957 as director of the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning play ''[[Look Homeward, Angel]]'' and [[Tennessee Williams]]’ ''[[Period of Adjustment (film)|Period of Adjustment]]''.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

=== Film ===
Hill filmed the Williams play as a Hollywood movie in 1962, then [[Lillian Hellman]]'s ''[[Toys in the Attic (1963 film)|Toys in the Attic]]'' in 1963.

The 1964 [[Peter Sellers]] movie ''[[The World of Henry Orient]]'' raised Hill's profile in Hollywood, but his 1966 blockbuster ''[[Hawaii (1966 film)|Hawaii]]'' was a setback. Reportedly, when budget estimates reached $14 million, the producers attempted to replace Hill with [[Arthur Hiller]]; but abandoned the idea after hundreds of native Polynesians in the cast went on strike, declaring: "We can and will perform only for our friend, Monsieur Hill."<ref name="Telegraph"/> 

Hill rebuilt his Hollywood reputation with the [[Julie Andrews]] movie ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'', then ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' and, after ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five (film)|Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', ''[[The Sting]]''. Both ''Butch Cassidy'' and ''The Sting'' starred [[Paul Newman]] and [[Robert Redford]].  ''Butch Cassidy'' won four Academy Awards; ''The Sting'' won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.<ref name="Times"/> The success of those two films meant that, for a time, Hill was the sole director in history to have made two of the top 10 moneymaking films.<ref name="NY Times"/>

Hill disliked tardiness on set. Paul Newman said of his time (as Cassidy) on ''Butch Cassidy'': "If you weren’t on time, he’d take you up in his airplane. Scare the bejesus out of us."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article693084.ece|title= interview in The Times, London, July 27, 2006 | date=July 27, 2006 | accessdate=May 3, 2010 |first=Greg |last=Hurst}}</ref>

Hill's later films included ''[[The World According to Garp (film)|The World According to Garp]]'',  ''[[The Great Waldo Pepper]]'', ''[[Slap Shot (movie)|Slap Shot]]'', ''[[A Little Romance]]'', ''[[Funny Farm (film)|Funny Farm]]'' and ''[[The Little Drummer Girl]]''.

Deaths in his films usually occur offscreen (''[[The Sting]]'', ''[[The Great Waldo Pepper]]'') or else a character is shot in [[Freeze frame shot|freeze frame]] the second before dying, while the soundtrack carries on (''Butch Cassidy'', ''Garp'').{{cn|date=January 2014}}
