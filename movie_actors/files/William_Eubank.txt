==Career==

===Panavision===
Eubank began working as a director at age 18, creating commercials for [[Mikasa Sports|Mikasa]] and other clients. He attended [[UCLA]] where he took [[cosmology]] classes that he would later cite as an influence on his films' ideas.<ref name="abcau">{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/movietime/interview-with-william-eubank2c-director-of-love/4233924 |title=Interview with William Eubank, director of Love |author=Rigg, Julie |date=30 August 2012 |work=MovieTime |publisher=[[ABC.au]] |accessdate=19 May 2014 }}</ref> He worked at [[Panavision]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], [[California]] for eight years, as a camera technician and [[digital imaging technician]].<ref name="self">{{cite web |url=http://www.williameubank.com/about.html |title=About William Eubank |author=Eubank, William |date= |work=artist portfolio |publisher= |accessdate=2009-10-30 }}</ref> Eubank attended the [[Sundance Film Festival]] five times representing Panavision, dreaming of attending as a director. He would meet with his grandfather, a former Navy cinematographer, who lived in Salt Lake City who insisted Eubank would someday attend with a film.<ref name="fcf">{{cite web |url=http://www.focusfeatures.com/article/finding_the_signal |title=Finding THE SIGNAL: A Q&A with Director William Eubank |author=Woods, Nicole |date=15 April 2014 |work=Q&As |publisher=[[Focus Features]] |accessdate=19 May 2014 }}</ref>

A number of Eubank's works feature the use of in-camera [[Cinematography#Frame rate selection|speed 'ramping']]. Shots of this style were featured in his Mikasa spots and in [[Proof of concept|reels]] for Honda, Adidas, Skullcandy, and others. Eubank was later hired by the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] to film fights in this style.<ref name="self"/>

===''Love''===
In 2007, Eubank was approached by [[Tom DeLonge]] to create material for the [[alternative rock]] band [[Angels & Airwaves]]. Eubank directed a number of music videos for the band, including the video for the single "Surrender".<ref name="surrender">{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzhNXoo6rwE |title=Angels & Airwaves "Surrender" Official Music Video |author=[[Angels & Airwaves]] |date=27 May 2013 |work=[[Love: Part Two]] |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=19 May 2014 }}</ref>{{npsn|date=December 2014}} Eubank also wrote and directed the feature film ''Love'', commissioned and produced by Angels & Airwaves. The film was inspired by [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|Thin Red Line]]'' and asks according to Eubank "[W]hat are we, as human beings, going to leave behind when we cease to exist one day...?"<ref name="taxi">{{cite web |url=http://www.popcorntaxi.com.au/2013/06/transcripts/love-director-william-eubank-and-actor-gunner-wright-discuss-the-process-of-movie-making/ |title=Love: director William Eubank and actor Gunner Wright Discuss the Process of Movie-making |author=Hillerstrom, Oscar |date= |work=Popcorn Taxi |publisher=Popcorn Taxi Australia |accessdate=2014-05-19 }}</ref> The emotion the film is titled after, 'love', is defined by Eubank as "The ability to feel and find complete communication without words or touch…the ability to find an understanding on nothing but a sense…"<ref name="phil">{{cite web |url=http://www.chrisandphilpresent.co.uk/interview-with-william-eubank-and-gunner-wright-love/ |title=Interview with William Eubank and Gunner Wright (Love) |author=Challis, Chris |date=10 March 2013 |work=Filmmaker Interviews |publisher=Chris and Phil Present |accessdate=19 May 2014 }}</ref>

Eubank spent four years working on the film, serving as the film's [[production designer]] and constructing both the [[International Space Station]] and [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-battleground sets for the film in his parents' backyard himself over the course of nine months.<ref name="keyt">{{cite interview |last=Eubank |first=William |subjectlink=William Eubank |interviewer=Beth Farnsworth and Ryan Carmel |title=Angels and Airwaves Presents "Love" |callsign =[[KEYT]] |city=Santa Barbara, California |date=2011-02-01 |program=KEY News |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref><ref name="aicn1">{{cite web |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/48144 |title=William Eubank’s Indie Sci-Fi Opus LOVE Looks Exciting And New! |author=Beaks |date=2011-01-19 |work=Ain't It Cool News |publisher=Harry Knowles |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref> Eubank based his building of the ISS set on [[NASA]] photography and skateboard ramp designs and his staging of the battle scenes on Civil War paintings.<ref name="taxi"/><ref name="eslf">{{cite web |url=http://www.eatsleeplivefilm.com/interview-william-eubank-director-of-love/ |title=Interview: William Eubank, Director of LOVE|author=McGrath, Jordan |date=6 September 2012 |work=Interviews|publisher=Eat Live Sleep Film |accessdate=19 May 2014 }}</ref> The filming was frequently interrupted by weather and the sounds of frogs and his family's neighbor operating a [[String trimmer|weedwhacker]].<ref name="taxi"/> On February 2, 2011, the film premiered at the [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]]. It later screened at 11 other festivals worldwide, including the [[List of film festivals in Europe#Greece|Athens International Film Festival]], where Eubank won the "Best Director" award. On August 10, 2011, [[National CineMedia]] released the film.

===''The Signal''===
While ''Love'' was still being edited, Eubank began writing a second screenplay, ''The Signal''. He collaborated on the script with fellow screenwriters David Frigerio and his brother, Carlyle Eubank. In an interview Eubank described his first thoughts for the project: "I'm a big fan of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', of what [[Rod Serling]] used to do as a storyteller, and I always wanted to do one of those – a story with intangibility and strangeness that makes you say, 'What the heck is going on?' I’d been thinking about the concept of an individual thrust into a specific and extreme situation, the true nature of which this person would have to uncover."<ref name="fcf"/> Before production could begin, Eubank worked as Second Unit Director on the 2012 [[Regency Enterprises|Regency]] film ''[[Broken City (film)|Broken City]]''. Soon after, ''The Signal'' found producers: Brian Kavanaugh-Jones of ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'' and Tyler Davidson of ''[[Take Shelter]]'' and production could begin.

Eubank described his main inspirations for the film as filmmakers Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch and also said the films ''[[Pi (film)|Pi]]'', ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]'', and ''[[Cube (film)|Cube]]'' were on his mind.<ref name="fcf"/> He decided to shoot the film in 2.39:1 theatrical anamorphic format saying "No other ratio allows you to stare right into an actor’s eyes; the performance can erupt. It helped with other aspects of the film, like the shots of New Mexico and of driving down the road with it coming up at you."

To cast the film, Eubank met with actors over [[Skype]] from New Mexico, settling on Australian actor [[Brenton Thwaites]], English actor [[Olivia Cooke]], and American actor Beau Knapp. For props, Eubank worked with [[Legacy Effects]] to design custom pieces. After two years of pre-production, ''The Signal'' began shooting in Albuquerque, where it would occasionally be hampered by sandstorms.<ref name="fcf"/> The films 29 shoot days took place in New Mexico and Ohio.

Eubank chose [[Brian Berdan]], an editor who worked on David Lynch's ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' and ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', to edit the film. Berdan and Eubank had collaborated before, Berdan having edited ''Love''. Eubank described his work with Berdan saying "Brian’s sensibilities are different from mine; on my first film, ''Love'', I realized that Brian had another way of looking at things than I did. I’ve come to appreciate his perspective, his fresh viewpoint, so much."<ref name="fcf"/>

While praising the film's "exquisite visual design", ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said that it was "ultimately quite silly".<ref name="signalvar">{{cite web |url=http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-the-signal-1201076629/ |title=Sundance Film Review: ‘The Signal’ |author=Berkshire,Geoff |date=29 January 2014 |work=Sundance Reviews |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=19 May 2014 }}</ref>
