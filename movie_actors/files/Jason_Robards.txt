'''Jason Nelson Robards, Jr.''' (July 26, 1922 – December 26, 2000) was an American actor on stage, and in film and television.  He was a winner of the [[Tony Award]], two [[Academy Awards]] and the [[Emmy Award]]. He was also a [[United States Navy]] [[combat]] [[veteran]] of [[World War II]].

He became famous playing works of American playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]] and regularly performed in O'Neill's works throughout his career.  Robards was cast both in common-man roles and as well-known historical figures.

==Early life and education==
Robards was born in Chicago, the son of Hope Maxine (née Glanville) Robards and [[Jason Robards, Sr.]],<ref>[http://dgmweb.net/genealogy/FGS/R/RobardsJasonNelson-HopeMaxineGlanville-AgnesE_.shtml ''Jason Robards genealogy''].</ref> an actor who regularly appeared on the stage and in such early films as ''[[The Gamblers (1929 film)|The Gamblers]]'' (1929). Robards was of English, Welsh, Irish, and Swedish descent.<ref>http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70717F8385F107A93C2AB178AD85F408785F9</ref><ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&p_theme=wt&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB0F3EB12656F62&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM]</ref>

The family moved to New York City, when Jason Jr. was still a toddler, and then moved to Los Angeles when he was six years old. Later interviews with Robards suggested that the trauma of his parents' divorce, which occurred during his grade-school years, greatly affected his personality and worldview.

As a youth, Robards also witnessed first-hand the decline of his father's acting career. The elder Robards had enjoyed considerable success during the era of [[silent films]], but he fell out of favor after the advent of "talkies" ([[sound film]]), leaving the younger Robards soured on the Hollywood film industry.

The teenage Robards excelled in athletics, running a 4:18-mile during his junior year at [[Hollywood High School]] in Los Angeles. Although his prowess in sports attracted interest from several universities, Robards decided to join the Navy upon his graduation in 1940.

==Naval service in World War II==
As a [[Radioman|radioman 3rd class]] in the Navy, Robards served aboard a [[heavy cruiser]], the [[USS Northampton (CA-26)|USS ''Northampton'']] (CA-26) in 1941. On [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|December 7, 1941]], he was aboard the ''Northampton'' in the Pacific Ocean about {{convert|100|mi|km}} off Hawaii. Contrary to some stories, he witnessed the devastation of the Japanese attack on Hawaii only afterwards, when the ''Northampton'' returned to [[Pearl Harbor]] two days later.<ref>Bloomfield, Gary L.; Shain, Stacie L., with Davidson, Arlen C., (2004). ''Duty, Honor, Applause – America's Entertainers in World War II''. p. 264. [[Lyon's Press]], [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]], Connecticut. ISBN 1-59228-550-3</ref> The ''Northampton'' was later directed into the [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal campaign]] in [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|World War II's Pacific theater]], where she participated in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]].

During the [[Battle of Tassafaronga]] in the waters north of Guadalcanal on the night of November 30, 1942, the ''Northampton'' was sunk by hits from two Japanese [[torpedo]]es. Robards found himself treading water until near daybreak, when he was rescued by an American [[destroyer]]. For its service in the war the ''Northampton'' was awarded six battle stars.

Two years later, in November 1944, Robards was radioman on the [[USS Nashville (CL-43)|USS ''Nashville'']] (CL-43), the flagship for the [[Battle of Mindoro|invasion of Mindoro]] in the northern [[Philippines]]. On December 13, she was struck by a [[kamikaze]] aircraft off [[Negros Island]] in the Philippines. The aircraft hit one of the port five-inch gun mounts, while its two bombs set the midsection ablaze. There were 223 casualties, and the ''Nashville'' was forced to return to Pearl Harbor and then to the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility|Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]], for repairs.

Robards served honorably during the war, but was not a recipient of the U.S. [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]] for bravery, as has been recorded in numerous uncited resources.  The inaccurate story that he was a Navy Cross recipient derives from a 1979 column by [[Hy Gardner]]<ref>Gardner, Hy. ''Panorama'' magazine, Vol. II, No. 1, Sunday ''Daily Herald'', January 7, 1979, p. 2</ref> which stated that Robards was awarded the medal.  From this false story, many subsequent references repeated the inaccuracy.  But Robards's name does not appear on any official or semi-official rolls of Navy Cross recipients.<ref>Sterner, C. Douglas. ''Index: Recipients of the Navy Cross, All Wars/All Periods, All Branches of Service''. Pueblo CO, 2006</ref>

It was on the ''Nashville'' that Robards first found a copy of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s play ''[[Strange Interlude]]'' in the ship's library.<ref name="ReferenceA">''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', January 20, 1974</ref><ref name="Shaughnessy">Black, Steven A., ''et al.'' (editors) (2002). ''Jason Robards Remembered – Essays and Recollections''. [[McFarland & Co.]], [[Jefferson, North Carolina|Jefferson]], North Carolina. ISBN 978-0-7864-1356-0.</ref> It was also in the Navy that he first started thinking seriously about becoming an actor. He had [[Master of Ceremonies|emceed]] for a Navy band in Pearl Harbor, got a few laughs and decided he liked it. His father suggested he enroll in the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York City.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Career==
Robards decided to get into acting after the war and his career started out slowly. He moved to New York City and found small parts – first in radio and then on the stage. His big break was landing the starring role in [[José Quintero]]'s 1956 [[off Broadway|off-Broadway-theatre]] revival production and the later 1960 television film of O'Neill's ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]'', portraying the philosophical salesman Hickey; he won an [[Obie Award]] for his stage performance.  He later portrayed Hickey again in another 1985 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival also staged by Quintero. Robards also created the role of Jamie Tyrone in the original Broadway production of O'Neill's Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]'', which was also directed by Quintero; Robards appeared in the lead role of James Tyrone, Sr. in a 1988 production of the same play. Other O'Neill plays directed by Quintero and featuring Robards included  ''[[Hughie]]'' (1964), ''[[A Touch of the Poet]]'' (1977) and ''[[A Moon for the Misbegotten]]'' (1973). He repeated his role in ''Long Day's Journey into Night'' in the [[Long Day's Journey into Night (1962 film)|1962 film]] and televised his performances in ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' (1975) and ''Hughie'' (1984).

Robards also appeared onstage in a revival of O'Neill's ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' (1988) directed by [[Arvin Brown]], as well as [[Lillian Hellman]]'s ''[[Toys in the Attic (play)|Toys in the Attic]]'' (1960), [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]'' (1964), [[Clifford Odets]]'s ''The Country Girl'' (1972) and [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[No Man's Land (play)|No Man's Land]]'' (1994).

[[File:Jason Robards-1975.jpg|thumb|left|Publicity photo, 1975]]
He made his film debut in the two-reel comedy ''Follow That Music'' (1947), but after his Broadway success he was invited to make his feature debut in ''[[The Journey (1959 film)|The Journey]]'' (1959).  He became a familiar face to movie audiences throughout the 1960s, notably for his performances in ''[[A Thousand Clowns (film)|A Thousand Clowns]]'' (1965) (repeating his stage performance), ''[[The Night They Raided Minsky's]]'' (1968) and ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968).

He appeared on television [[anthology series]], including two segments in the mid-1950s of [[CBS]]'s ''[[Appointment with Adventure]]''.

Robards played three different U.S. presidents in film. He played the role of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the TV movie ''The Perfect Tribute'' (1991) and supplied the voice for two television documentaries, first for "The Presidency: A Splendid Misery" in 1964, and then again in the title role of the 1992 documentary miniseries ''Lincoln''. He also played the role of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in ''[[The Legend of the Lone Ranger]]'' (1981) and supplied the Union General's voice in the [[PBS]] miniseries ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' (1990). He also played [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in ''FDR: The Final Years'' (1980).

Robards appeared in two dramatizations based on the [[Watergate scandal]]. In 1976 he portrayed [[Washington Post]] executive editor [[Ben Bradlee]] in the film ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'', based on the book by [[Carl Bernstein]] and [[Bob Woodward]]. The next year, he played fictional president Richard Monckton (based on [[Richard Nixon]]) in the 1977 television miniseries ''[[Washington: Behind Closed Doors]]'' based on [[John Ehrlichman]]'s [[roman à clef]] ''[[The Company (Ehrlichman novel)|The Company]]''. In 1983, Robards starred in the television movie ''[[The Day After]]'' where he played Dr. Russell Oakes. The movie is one of the most viewed television programs of all time.

Robards voiced a number of documentaries, including [[Ken Burns]]'s ''[[Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio]]'' (1991).

In ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999), his final feature film role, the ailing Robards portrayed a dying man who reconnects with his estranged son, played by [[Tom Cruise]].

In 1999, he was among the recipients at the [[Kennedy Center Honors]], an annual honor given to those in the [[performing arts]] for their lifetime of contributions to [[American culture]].<ref>[http://www.kennedy-center.org/programs/specialevents/honors/history/home.html "Kennedy Center list of Honorees"].</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:JasonRobards-1 (2).jpg|thumb|around 1975]]
Robards had six children from his four marriages, including actor Jason Robards III (born 1949) by his first wife, Eleanor Pittman; and actor [[Sam Robards]] by his third wife, actress [[Lauren Bacall]], to whom he was married in 1961. They divorced in 1969, in significant part because of his alcoholism.<ref>Bacall, Lauren. (2006). ''By Myself and Then Some''. p. 377. [[HarperCollins]], New York City. ISBN 978-0-06-112791-5.</ref>

In 1972 he was seriously injured in an automobile accident when he drove his car into the side of a mountain on a winding California road, requiring extensive surgery and facial reconstruction. The accident may have been related to his longtime struggle with alcoholism.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Shaughnessy"/> Robards recovered from his addiction and went on to publicly campaign for alcoholism awareness.<ref>http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19821015&id=2BgiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=P2gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5306,8166819</ref><ref>http://www.adcouncil.org/content/download/1297/11435/version/1/file/matters_of_choice.pdf</ref>

Robards was a [[United States Civil War|U.S. Civil War]] buff and scholar, an interest which informed his portrayal of the voice of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' series by filmmaker [[Ken Burns]].

==Death==
Robards was a resident of the [[Southport, Connecticut|Southport]] section of [[Fairfield, Connecticut]].<ref>"From the Archives" feature ("The Week of July 8") of ''[[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]]'' ([[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]]), July 9, 2007, page A7, Stamford edition.</ref> He died of [[lung cancer]] in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]], on December 26, 2000, at the age of 78. He was cremated. 
 
His death was mourned by both fans and actors. "He was the last of a breed of actors who dedicated themselves to a life in the theater. Without asking for the role, he was our elder statesman," said actor [[Kevin Spacey]].<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', February 27, 2001</ref>

==Legacy==
''The Jason Robards Award'' was created by the [[Roundabout Theatre Company]] in New York City in his honor and his relationship with the theatre.
