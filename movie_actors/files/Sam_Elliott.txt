His [[Wiktionary:rangy|rangy]] physique, thick [[horseshoe moustache]], deep, resonant voice, and Western [[drawl]] lend to frequent [[casting (performing arts)|casting]] as [[cowboy]]s and ranchers.

He attended [[Clark College (Washington)|Clark College]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]], where he completed a two-year program and was cast as one of the leads in ''[[Guys and Dolls]]''. The local newspaper suggested that Elliott should be a professional actor. Soon after, Elliott declared he was going to Hollywood to become a star. Elliott is a member of the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] at [[California State University, Los Angeles|Cal State LA]]. He worked in construction while studying acting in Los Angeles and served in the [[California Army National Guard]]. Elliott also lived for a short time in [[Princeton, West Virginia]].<ref name="Perfect People">{{cite web |title=Sam Elliot Biography |url=http://www.perfectpeople.net/biography/10118/sam-elliott.htm |publisher=Perfect People |year=2012 |accessdate=2013-01-22}}</ref>

==Career==
Elliott began his career as a [[character actor]]; his appearance, voice, and bearing were well-suited to [[Westerns]]. One of his first film roles was as 'Card Player #2' in ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969). 

In 1970–71, Sam Elliott starred as Doug Robert in the hit [[TV series]] ''[[Mission: Impossible]]'', and played the lead character Sam Damon in ''[[Once an Eagle]]'', an [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] [[miniseries]] during the 1976–77 season. He also played Tom Keating in the mini-series Aspen in 1977. He also had the starring role as Rick Carlson in the summer hit sleeper ''[[Lifeguard (film)|Lifeguard]]'' (1976). In 1979, he played the oldest brother in the made-for-TV miniseries ''[[The Sacketts]]'', also starring Tom Selleck, Ben Johnson, Slim Pickens, Glenn Ford, Ruth Roman, Mercedes McCambridge, Jack Elam, and Gilbert Roland. He later played a wife killer in the miniseries ''Murder in Texas'' (1981) and ''A Death in California'' (1985). Elliott's breakthrough came with his supporting role in ''[[Mask (film)|Mask]]'' (1985) when he co-starred with Cher. He has made guest appearances on shows such as ''[[Felony Squad]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'', and ''[[Hawaii Five-O]]'' and has been featured in many [[TV movie]]s, including ''[[Prancer (film)|Prancer]]'' (1989) and ''[[Buffalo Girls]]'' (1995) in which he played [[Wild Bill Hickok]]. In 1986 he starred in a TV movie ''[[Gone to Texas]]'' about Sam Houston's biography.  The role allowed him to play Houston as both fighter and a man who grew into a skillful political leader as the film followed him from his leaving the Governor's office in Tennessee in disgrace, to returning to his Cherokee Nation friends, to his pivotal role in the liberation of Texas from Mexico in 1836.  He has also starred in ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]]'' (1989) with [[Patrick Swayze]] and played [[Virgil Earp]] in ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' (1993), which starred [[Kurt Russell]] and [[Val Kilmer]]. In 1998, Elliot was named the grand marshal of the [[Calgary Stampede]] parade and rode in the [[procession]] before an estimated 300,000 spectators.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Elliott co-starred in ''[[We Were Soldiers]]'', which is based on the book ''[[We Were Soldiers Once… And Young]]'', portraying [[Sergeant Major#United States Army|Sgt. Maj.]] [[Basil L. Plumley]]. He portrayed General [[John Buford]] in the 1993 film ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]''. He also played [[General Thunderbolt Ross]] in the 2003 film ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]''.

Elliott played "The Stranger", a character narrating the story of ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998). In 2005 he appeared in ''[[Thank You For Smoking (film)|Thank You For Smoking]]'', where he played a former [[Marlboro Man]] advertisement cowboy who has developed lung cancer. Elliot joined [[Nicolas Cage]] in 2007 in the popular ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'', and stood out in another film that same year, in ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'' as a key character, Lee Scoresby. In 2009, Elliott had a small role in ''[[Up in the Air (2009 film)|Up In The Air]]'' in which he portrayed the Chief Pilot of American Airlines. He has appeared three times on ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'' as Ron Dunn, the Eagleton equivalent of [[Ron Swanson]]; Ron Dunn is a hippie, compared to Swanson's staunch survivalist-Libertarian personality. He has a supporting role in the film ''[[The Company You Keep (film)|The Company You Keep]]'' and plays a college football coach in 2014's ''[[Draft Day]]''.

=== Voice acting ===

Elliott has performed voice-over narration for various commercials. He has lent his voice to campaigns for [[Dodge]], [[IBM]],  [[Kinney Drugs]],  [[Union Pacific]], and, most notably, the [[American Beef Council]], succeeding [[Robert Mitchum]] in the latter. Since late 2007, Elliott has done voice-overs for [[Coors Beer|Coors]] beer, bringing his deep, rich voice and "western" appeal to the brand brewed in Colorado. In 2010, [[Ram Trucks]] hired Elliott to do the voice-over for their Ram Heavy Duty truck commercial; he has been voicing their commercials since. He is also the new voice for [[Smokey Bear]] ("Only YOU can prevent wildfires"), and shares the mascot's birth date (August 9. 1944). Eliott lent his voice to "Buster" (a.k.a. Chupadogra) in ''[[Marmaduke (film)|Marmaduke]]'' (2010). He also narrated the [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] team introductions to [[Super Bowl XLV]] – played at [[AT&T Stadium|Cowboys Stadium]] in [[Arlington, Texas]], at the conclusion of the {{nfly|2010}} NFL season – for [[NFL on Fox|Fox Sports]].

==Personal life==
Elliott married actress [[Katharine Ross]] in 1984. Although Ross starred in ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', in which Elliott had a very small role, the two did not meet and begin dating until 1978 when they both starred with [[Roger Daltrey]] in ''[[The Legacy (1979 film)|The Legacy]]''.  He and Katharine Ross have a daughter, Cleo Rose Elliott,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20112574,00.html|title=Katharine Ross|date=4 May 1992|work=People|accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref> born in 1984, who is now a musician in Malibu.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.malibutimes.com/articles/2008/12/31/malibu_life/art3.txt|title=Straight from her heart|last=Magruder|first=Melonie|date=31 December 2008|work=Malibu Times|accessdate=10 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1365372/Graduate-star-Katharine-Ross-gets-death-threat-daughter-Cleo.html|title='Cleo: |date=12 March 2011|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=15 April 2011}}</ref>
