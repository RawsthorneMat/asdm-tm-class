'''Vivian Mary Hartley''', later known as '''Vivien Leigh''' (5 November 1913{{spaced ndash}}8 July 1967), was an English stage and film actress.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/femail/video-1061241/Vivien-Leigh-English-portraying-Americans.html "Vivien Leigh on being English, portraying Americans."] ''Daily Mail'' (online), 3 November 2013. Retrieved: 3 February 2015.</ref> She won two [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for her performances as "[[Southern belle]]" [[Scarlett O'Hara]] in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939) and [[Blanche DuBois]] in the film version of [[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|''A Streetcar Named Desire'']] (1951), a role she had also played on stage in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1949. She also won a [[Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical|Tony Award]] for her work in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] version of ''[[Tovarich (musical)|Tovarich]]'' (1963).

After her drama school education, Leigh appeared in small roles in four films in 1935 and progressed to the role of heroine in ''[[Fire Over England]]'' (1937). Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that it sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress. Despite her fame as a screen actress, Leigh was primarily a stage performer. During her 30-year stage career, she played roles ranging from the heroines of [[Noël Coward]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] comedies to classic [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] characters such as [[Ophelia]], [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]], [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]] and [[Lady Macbeth]]. Later in life, she played [[character role]]s in a few films.

To the public at the time, Leigh was strongly identified with her second husband [[Laurence Olivier]], to whom she was married from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and Olivier starred together in many stage productions, with Olivier often directing, and in three films. She earned a reputation for being difficult to work with, as for much of her adult life, she suffered from [[bipolar disorder]], as well as recurrent bouts of chronic [[tuberculosis]], first diagnosed in the mid-1940s, which ultimately claimed her life at the age of 53.<ref name="Laurence">Olivier 1982, p. 174.</ref> Although her career had periods of inactivity, in 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Leigh as [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|the 16th greatest female movie star of all time]].

==Early life and acting debut==
Leigh was born Vivian Mary Hartley<ref name=Dict.>Briggs 1992, p. 338.</ref> in [[British Raj|British India]] on the campus of [[St. Paul's School, Darjeeling]]. She was the only child of Ernest Richard Hartley, an English broker, and his wife, Gertrude Mary Frances (née Yackjee; she also used the name Robinson).<ref>Bean 2013, pp. 20–21.</ref> Her mother, a devout Roman Catholic, may have been of Irish and [[Parsi]] Indian ancestry.<ref>Vickers 1988, p. 6.</ref> Ernest and Gertrude Hartley were married in 1912 in [[Kensington]], London.<ref>''General Register Office of England and Wales, Marriages'', June quarter 1912, Kensington vol. 1a, p. 426.</ref>

In 1917 Ernest Hartley was transferred to [[Bangalore]] as an officer in the [[British Indian Army|Indian Cavalry]], while Gertrude and Vivian stayed in [[Ootacamund]].<ref>Vickers 1988, p. 9.</ref> At the age of three, young Vivian made her first stage appearance for her mother's amateur theatre group, reciting "[[Little Bo Peep]]".<ref>Walker 1987, p. 25.</ref> Gertrude Hartley tried to instil an appreciation of literature in her daughter and introduced her to the works of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]], as well as stories of [[Greek mythology]] and [[Indian folklore]].<ref>Bean 2013, p. 21.</ref> At the age of six, Vivian was sent by her mother to the Convent of the Sacred Heart (now [[Woldingham School]]) then situated in [[Roehampton]], southwest London, from [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling]].<ref>Taylor 1984, p. 32.</ref> One of her friends there was future actress [[Maureen O'Sullivan]], two years her senior, to whom Vivian expressed her desire to become "a great actress".<ref>Walker 1987, p. 32.</ref><ref>Edwards 1978, pp. 12–19.</ref> She was removed from the school by her father, and travelling with her parents for four years, she attended schools in Europe, notably in [[Dinard]], [[Biarritz]], San Remo and Paris, becoming fluent in both French and Italian.<ref>Taylor 1984, pp. 33–34.</ref> The family returned to Britain in 1931. She attended ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (film)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'', one of O'Sullivan's films playing in [[West End of London|London's West End]] and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress. Shortly after, her father enrolled Vivian at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in London.<ref>Edwards 1978, pp. 25–30.</ref>

Vivian met Herbert Leigh Holman, known as Leigh Holman, a barrister 13 years her senior, in 1931.<ref>Walker 1987, p. 39.</ref> Despite his disapproval of "theatrical people", they married on 20 December 1932, and she terminated her studies at RADA; her attendance and interest in acting having already waned after meeting Holman.<ref>Walker 1984, pp. 38–39.</ref> On 12 October 1933 in London, she gave birth to a daughter, [[Suzanne Farrington|Suzanne]], later Mrs. Robin Farrington.<ref name="Leigh Profile">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/337185%7C0/Vivien-Leigh-Star-of-the-Month-.html "Vivien Leigh profile."] ''[[Turner Classic Movies]]''.

==Early career==
Leigh's friends suggested she take a small role as a schoolgirl in the film ''Things Are Looking Up'', which was her film debut, albeit uncredited as an extra.<ref>Bean 2013, p. 24.</ref> She engaged an agent, John Gliddon, who believed that "Vivian Holman" was not a suitable name for an actress. After rejecting his many suggestions, she took "Vivian Leigh" as her professional name.<ref name="Taylor 1984, p. 38">Taylor 1984, p. 38.</ref>{{refn|For stage names, Gliddon proposed "Susan" then  "Suzanne Hartley" and "Mary Hartley", before the more outlandish "April Morn" and "April Maugham".<ref>Capus 2003, p. 19.</ref>|group=Note}} Gliddon recommended her to [[Alexander Korda]] as a possible film actress, but Korda rejected her as lacking potential.<ref>Edwards 1978, pp. 30–43.</ref> She was cast in the play ''The Mask of Virtue'', directed by [[Sidney Carroll]] in 1935 and received excellent reviews, followed by interviews and newspaper articles. One such article was from the ''[[Daily Express]]'', in which the interviewer noted "a lightning change came over her face", which was the first public mention of the rapid changes in mood which had become characteristic of her.<ref>Coleman 2005, p. 74.</ref> [[John Betjeman]], the future [[Poet Laureate]], described her as "the essence of English girlhood".<ref>Coleman 2005, p. 75.</ref> Korda attended her opening night performance, admitted his error, and signed her to a film contract.<ref name="Taylor 1984, p. 38"/> She continued with the play; but, when Korda moved it to a larger theatre, Leigh was found to be unable to project her voice adequately or to hold the attention of so large an audience, and the play closed soon after.<ref>Edwards 1978, pp. 50–55.</ref> In the playbill, Carroll had revised the spelling of her first name to "Vivien".<ref>Taylor 1984, p. 40.</ref>

In 1960 Leigh recalled her ambivalence towards her first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, "some critics saw fit to be as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices.<ref>Bean 2013, pp. 26–27.</ref> I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him."<ref name="ActorTalk">Funke and Boothe 1983, p. 82.</ref>

==Meeting Laurence Olivier==
Laurence Olivier saw Leigh in ''The Mask of Virtue'', and after he congratulated her on her performance, a friendship developed. Olivier and Leigh began an affair while acting as lovers in ''[[Fire Over England]]'' (1937), but Olivier was still married to actress [[Jill Esmond]].<ref>Walker 1987, pp. 75–76.</ref> During this period, Leigh read the [[Margaret Mitchell]] novel ''[[Gone with the Wind]]'' and instructed her American agent to suggest her to [[David O. Selznick]], who was planning a film version.<ref name="Taylor p. 14">Taylor 1984, p. 14.</ref> She remarked to a journalist, "I've cast myself as Scarlett O'Hara"; and ''[[The Observer]]'' film critic [[C. A. Lejeune]] recalled a conversation of the same period in which Leigh "stunned us all" with the assertion that Olivier "won't play [[Rhett Butler]], but I shall play Scarlett O'Hara. Wait and see."<ref>Coleman 2005, pp. 76–77, 90, 94–95.</ref>

Despite her relative inexperience, Leigh was chosen to play Ophelia to Olivier's [[Hamlet]] in an [[Old Vic Theatre]] production staged at [[Elsinore]], Denmark.<ref>Coleman 2005, p. 92.</ref> Olivier later recalled an incident when her mood rapidly changed as she was preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him, before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap; and, by the following day, she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It was the first time Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her.<ref>Coleman 2005, pp. 97–98.</ref> They began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce.<ref>Walker 1987, p. 92.</ref> Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.

Leigh appeared with [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], [[Lionel Barrymore]] and Maureen O'Sullivan in ''[[A Yank at Oxford]]'' (1938), the first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends.<ref>Walker 1987, p. 93.</ref> After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve.<ref>Walker 1987, p. 95.</ref> Her next role was in ''[[Sidewalks of London]]'', also known as ''St. Martin's Lane'' (1938), with [[Charles Laughton]].<ref>Coleman 2005, p. 97.</ref>

Olivier had been attempting to broaden his film career. He was not well known in the United States despite his success in Britain, and earlier attempts to introduce him to American audiences had failed. Offered the role of [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] in [[Samuel Goldwyn]]'s production of ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' (1939), he travelled to Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London. Goldwyn and the film's director, [[William Wyler]], offered Leigh the secondary role of Isabella; but she refused, preferring the role of Cathy, which went to [[Merle Oberon]].<ref>Berg 1989, p. 323.</ref>

==''Gone with the Wind''==
[[File:Gable-Leigh GWTW-b.jpg|thumb|With [[Clark Gable]] in ''Gone with the Wind'' (1939)]]
[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] was in the midst of a widely publicised search to find an actress to portray [[Scarlett O'Hara]] in David O. Selznick's production of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939).<ref name="Taylor p. 14"/> At the time, [[Myron Selznick]], David's brother, and Leigh's American theatrical [[agent (law)|agent]] was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency. In February 1938, Leigh made a request to Myron Selznick that she be considered to play Scarlett O'Hara.<ref>Bean 2013, p. 52.</ref>

Myron Selznick, who watched her performances that month in ''Fire Over England'' and ''A Yank at Oxford'', thought her to be excellent, but, in no way, a possible Scarlett, as she was "too British". Leigh travelled to Los Angeles, however, to be with Olivier and to try to convince David Selznick that she was Scarlett. When Myron Selznick, who also represented Olivier, met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities his brother was searching for.<ref>Walker 1987, p. 113.</ref> According to legend, Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the burning of the [[Atlanta]] Depot scene was being filmed and stage-managed an encounter, where he introduced Leigh, derisively addressing his younger brother, "Hey, genius, meet your Scarlett O'Hara."<ref>Bean 2013, pp. 51–53.</ref> The following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organised a [[screen test]] with director [[George Cukor]], and wrote to his wife, "She's the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good. Not for anyone's ear but your own: it's narrowed down to [[Paulette Goddard]], [[Jean Arthur]], [[Joan Bennett]] and Vivien Leigh".<ref>Taylor 1984 p. 15.</ref> The director, George Cukor, concurred and praised Leigh's "incredible wildness"; she secured the role of Scarlett soon after.<ref>Haver 1980, p. 259.</ref>

Filming proved difficult for Leigh. Cukor was dismissed and replaced by [[Victor Fleming]], with whom Leigh frequently quarrelled. She and [[Olivia de Havilland]] secretly met with Cukor at night and on weekends for his advice about how they should play their parts.<ref>Walker 1987, p. 124.</ref><ref name="Taylor p. 22">Taylor 1984, p. 22.</ref> Leigh befriended Clark Gable, his wife [[Carole Lombard]] and Olivia de Havilland; but she clashed with [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], with whom she was required to play several emotional scenes.<ref name="Taylor p. 22"/><ref>Howard 1984, p. 19.</ref> Leigh was sometimes required to work seven days a week, often late into the night, which added to her distress; and she missed Olivier, who was working in New York City.<ref name="Taylor 1984, pp. 22–23"/> On a long-distance telephone call to Olivier, she declared: "Puss, my puss, how I hate film acting! Hate, hate, and never want to do another film again!"<ref name="Taylor 1984, pp. 22–23">Taylor 1984, pp. 22–23.</ref>

Quoted in a 2006 biography of Olivier, Olivia de Havilland defended Leigh against claims of her [[mania|manic behaviour]] during the filming of ''Gone with the Wind'': "Vivien was impeccably professional, impeccably disciplined on ''Gone with the Wind''. She had two great concerns: doing her best work in an extremely difficult role and being separated from Larry [Olivier], who was in New York."<ref>Thomas, Bob. [http://www.dcexaminer.com/articles/2006/01/04/features/books/62bbooks04olivier.txt "Quoting Olivia de Havilland."] ''DC Examiner'' (''The Associated Press''), 3 January 2006. Retrieved: 7 January 2006.</ref>

''Gone with the Wind'' brought Leigh immediate attention and fame; but she was quoted as saying, "I'm not a film star&nbsp;– I'm an actress. Being a film star&nbsp;– just a film star&nbsp;– is such a false life, lived for fake values and for publicity. Actresses go on for a long time and there are always marvellous parts to play."<ref name="Taylor 1984, pp. 22–23"/> The film won 10 [[Academy Awards]] including a [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] award for Leigh,<ref>[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1419209271057 "Gone with the Wind."] ''Academy Awards Database'' (Oscars.org) ([[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]).

==Marriage and early joint projects==
[[File:Vivien Leigh Scarlet.jpg|upright|thumb|Leigh as [[Scarlett O'Hara]]]]

In February 1940, Jill Esmond agreed to divorce Olivier, and Leigh Holman agreed to divorce Leigh, although they maintained a strong friendship for the rest of Leigh's life. Esmond was granted custody of Tarquin, her son with Olivier. Holman was granted custody of Suzanne, his daughter with Leigh. On 31 August 1940, Olivier and Leigh were married at the [[San Ysidro Ranch]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], in a ceremony attended only by their hosts, [[Ronald Colman|Ronald]] and Benita Coleman and witnesses, [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Garson Kanin]].<ref>Walker 1987, pp. 150–151.</ref> Leigh had made a screen test and hoped to co-star with Olivier in ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'', which was to be directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] with Olivier in the leading role. After viewing Leigh's screen test, David Selznick noted that "she doesn't seem right as to sincerity or age or innocence", a view shared by Hitchcock and Leigh's mentor, George Cukor.<ref>McGilligan 2003, p. 238.</ref>

Selznick observed that she had shown no enthusiasm for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor so he cast [[Joan Fontaine]]. He refused to allow her to join Olivier in ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940), and [[Greer Garson]] played the role Leigh had wanted for herself.<ref>Vickers 1988, p. 118.</ref> ''[[Waterloo Bridge (1940 film)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced Olivier with Robert Taylor, then at the peak of his success as one of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s most popular male stars.<ref>Bean 2013, pp. 73–74.</ref> Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.<ref>[http://movies.yahoo.com/person/vivien-leigh/biography.html "Vivien Leigh- Biography."] ''[[Yahoo! Movies]]''. Retrieved: 13 October 2012.</ref>

The Oliviers mounted a stage production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The New York press publicised the adulterous nature of the beginning of Olivier and Leigh's relationship and questioned their ethics in not returning to the UK to help with the [[World War II|war]] effort.<ref>Vickers 1988, p. 152.</ref>{{refn|After Olivier enrolled in the [[Fleet Air Arm]], he served for two years as a pilot, resigning his commission in 1943 as a Lieutenant-Commander.<ref>Spoto 2001, pp. 147–148.</ref> Ultimately, [[Ralph Richardson]] and others dissuaded him, convincing Olivier that his contribution to the war effort should be on stage and in film.<ref>Walker 1987, p. 157.</ref>|group=Note}}

Critics were hostile in their assessment of ''Romeo and Juliet''. [[Brooks Atkinson]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "Although Miss Leigh and Mr. Olivier are handsome young people, they hardly act their parts at all."<ref>Edwards 1978, p. 127.</ref> While most of the blame was attributed to Olivier's acting and direction, Leigh was also criticised, with [[Bernard Grebanier]] commenting on the "thin, shopgirl quality of Miss Leigh's voice".<ref>Holden 1989, pp. 189–190.</ref> The couple had invested almost all of their combined savings of $40,000 into the project, and the failure was a financial disaster for them.<ref>Taylor 1984, p. 59.</ref>

The Oliviers filmed ''[[That Hamilton Woman]]'' (1941) with Olivier as [[Horatio Nelson]] and Leigh as [[Emma Hamilton]]. With the United States not yet having entered the war, it was one of several Hollywood films made with the aim of arousing a pro-British sentiment among American audiences.<ref>Bean 2013, pp. 80–81.</ref> The film was popular in the United States and an outstanding success in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Walker 1987, p. 65.</ref> [[Winston Churchill]] arranged a screening for a party that included [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and, on its conclusion, addressed the group, saying, "Gentlemen, I thought this film would interest you, showing great events similar to those in which you have just been taking part." The Oliviers remained favourites of Churchill, attending dinners and occasions at his request for the rest of his life; and, of Leigh, he was quoted as saying, "By Jove, she's a clinker."<ref>Holden 1989, pp. 202, 205, 325.</ref>

The Oliviers returned to Britain, and in 1943, Leigh toured through North Africa as part of a revue for the armed forces stationed in the region. Leigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers.<ref>Walker 1987, pp. 166–167.</ref> In 1944 she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in her left [[human lung|lung]] and spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered. Leigh was filming ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (film)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' (1945) when she discovered she was pregnant, but she suffered a [[miscarriage]].<ref>Vickers 1988, p. 167.</ref> Leigh temporarily fell into a deep depression that hit its low point, with  her falling to the floor, sobbing in a hysterical fit.<ref>Walker 1987, p. 170.</ref> This was the first of many major breakdowns she suffered related to bipolar disorder. Olivier would later come to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode&nbsp;– several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of depression and an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would have no memory of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.<ref>Holden 1989, pp. 221–222.</ref>

[[File:Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier, Broadbeach, Australia, 1948.jpg|thumb|Leigh and Olivier in Australia, June 1948]]

With her doctor's approval, Leigh was well enough to resume acting in 1946, starring in a successful London production of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]''; but her films of this period, ''Caesar and Cleopatra'' (1945) and ''[[Anna Karenina (1948 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1948), were not great commercial successes. All British films in this period were adversely affected by a Hollywood boycott of British films.<ref>Bean 2013, p. 115.</ref>

In 1947 Olivier was [[knighthood|knighted]] and Leigh accompanied him to [[Buckingham Palace]] for the investiture. She became Lady Olivier.<ref>Bean 2013, p. 111.</ref> After their divorce, according to the style granted to the divorced wife of a knight, she became known socially as Vivien, Lady Olivier.<ref>Spoto 2001, p. 327.</ref>

By 1948 Olivier was on the board of directors for the Old Vic Theatre, and he and Leigh embarked on a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand to raise funds for the theatre. Olivier played the lead in  ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' and also performed with Leigh in ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' and ''The Skin of Our Teeth''. The tour was an outstanding success and, although Leigh was plagued with [[insomnia]] and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to "charm the press". Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple as Olivier was increasingly resentful of the demands placed on him during the tour.<ref>Spoto 2001, p. 216.</ref> The most dramatic altercation occurred in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, when her shoes were not found and Leigh refused to go onstage without shoes. An exhausted and exasperated Olivier screamed an obscenity at her and slapped her face, and a devastated Leigh slapped him in return, dismayed that he would hit her publicly. Subsequently, she made her way to the stage in borrowed pumps, and in seconds, had "dried her tears and smiled brightly onstage".<ref>Spoto 2001, pp. 217–218.</ref> By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill. Olivier told a journalist, "You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses." Later, he would observe that he "lost Vivien" in Australia.<ref>Holden 1989, p. 295.</ref>

The success of the tour encouraged the Oliviers to make their first West End appearance together, performing the same works with one addition, ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]],'' included at Leigh's insistence because she wished to play a role in a [[tragedy]].<ref>Spoto 2001, p. 218.</ref>

==''A Streetcar Named Desire''==
[[File:Vivien Leigh in Streetcar Named Desire trailer 1.jpg|left|thumb|As Blanche DuBois, from the trailer for the film version of [[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (1951)]]]]
Leigh next sought the role of [[Blanche DuBois]] in the West End stage production of [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' and was cast after Williams and the play's producer [[Irene Mayer Selznick]] saw her in ''The School for Scandal'' and ''Antigone''; Olivier was contracted to direct.<ref>Bean 2013, pp. 125–126.</ref> Containing a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, the play was destined to be controversial, and the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety. Nevertheless, she believed strongly in the importance of the work.<ref>Spoto 2001, pp. 218–219.</ref>

When the West End production of ''Streetcar'' opened in October 1949, [[J. B. Priestley]] denounced the play and Leigh's performance; and the critic [[Kenneth Tynan]], who was to make a habit of dismissing her stage performances,<ref>Shellard [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3U0q-DTHHDgC&pg=PA126 2003, p. 126.]</ref> commented that Leigh was badly miscast because British actors were "too well-bred to emote effectively on stage". Olivier and Leigh were chagrined that part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to see what they believed would be a salacious story, rather than the [[Greek tragedy]] that they envisioned. The play also had strong supporters,<ref>Coleman 2005, pp. 227–231.</ref> among them Noël Coward, who described Leigh as "magnificent".<ref>Holden 1989, p. 312.</ref>

After 326 performances, Leigh finished her run, and she was soon engaged to reprise her role as Blanche DuBois in the [[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|film version]].{{refn|Leigh's fee of $100,000 for ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' made her the highest paid British actress in 1951; Marlon Brando was paid $75,000 for his role.<ref name="Walker p. 167"/>|group=Note}} Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with her co-star [[Marlon Brando]], but she had an initial difficulty in working with director [[Elia Kazan]], who was displeased with the direction that Olivier had taken in shaping the character of Blanche.<ref>Thomas 1974, p. 67.</ref> Kazan had favoured [[Jessica Tandy]] and later, Olivia de Havilland over Leigh, but knew she had been a success on the London stage as Blanche.<ref name="Walker p. 167">Walker 1987, p. 167.</ref>  He later commented that he did not hold her in high regard as an actress; "she had a small talent," but, as work progressed, he became "full of admiration" for "the greatest determination to excel of any actress I've known. She'd have crawled over broken glass if she thought it would help her performance." Leigh found the role gruelling and commented to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now she's in command of me."<ref>Coleman 2005, pp. 233–236.</ref> Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co-star with [[Jennifer Jones]] in William Wyler's ''[[Carrie (1952 film)|Carrie]]'' (1952).

Leigh's performance in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' won glowing reviews, as well as a second Academy Award for Best Actress,<ref>Taylor 1984, p. 91.</ref> a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) Award for Best British Actress, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.<ref>Bean 2013, p. 145.</ref> Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role "everything that I intended, and much that I had never dreamed of". Leigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois "tipped me over into madness".<ref>Holden 1989, pp. 312–313.</ref>

==Struggle with illness==
In 1951 Leigh and Olivier performed two plays about [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]], [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' and [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'', alternating the play each night and winning good reviews.<ref>Walker 1987, pp. 204–205.</ref> They took the productions to New York, where they performed a season at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1927)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] into 1952.<ref>Capus 2003, p. 119.</ref> The reviews there were also mostly positive, but the critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own.<ref>Tynan 1961, p. 9.</ref> Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of other critics.<ref>Edwards 1978, pp. 196–197.</ref>

In January 1953, Leigh travelled to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] to film ''[[Elephant Walk]]'' with [[Peter Finch]]. Shortly after filming commenced, she suffered a breakdown and [[Paramount Pictures]] replaced her with [[Elizabeth Taylor]].<ref>Taylor 1984, pp. 93–94.</ref> Olivier returned her to their home in Britain, where, between periods of incoherence, Leigh told him she was in love with Finch and had been having an affair with him.<ref>Walker 1987, p. 213.</ref> She gradually recovered over a period of several months. As a result of this episode, many of the Oliviers' friends learned of her problems. [[David Niven]] said she had been "quite, quite mad". Noël Coward expressed surprise in his diary that "things had been bad and getting worse since 1948 or thereabouts".<ref>Coleman 2005, pp. 254–263.</ref> Leigh's romantic relationship with Finch began in 1948, and waxed and waned for several years, ultimately flickering out as her mental condition deteriorated.<ref name=Brooks>Brooks, Richard. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article552527.ece "Olivier Worn Out by Love and Lust of Vivien Leigh".] ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 7 August 2005. (Password required) Retrieved: 27 July 2008.</ref>

In 1953 Leigh recovered sufficiently to play ''[[The Sleeping Prince (play)|The Sleeping Prince]]'' with Olivier; and, in 1955, they performed a season at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Twelfth Night, or What You Will|Twelfth Night]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', and ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''.<ref>Capus 2003, p. 131.</ref> They played to capacity houses and attracted generally good reviews, Leigh's health seemingly stable. [[John Gielgud]] directed ''Twelfth Night'' and wrote, "...&nbsp;perhaps I will still make a good thing of that divine play, especially if he will let me pull her little ladyship (who is brainier than he but ''not'' a born actress) out of her timidity and safeness. He dares too confidently&nbsp;... but she hardly dares at all and is terrified of overreaching her technique and doing anything that she has not killed the spontaneity of by overpractice."<ref>Coleman 2005, p. 271.</ref> In 1955 Leigh starred in [[Anatole Litvak]]'s film ''[[The Deep Blue Sea (1955 film)|The Deep Blue Sea]]''; co-star [[Kenneth More]] felt he had poor chemistry with Leigh during the filming.<ref>More 1978, pp. 163–167.</ref>

In 1956 Leigh took the lead role in the Noël Coward play ''[[South Sea Bubble (play)|South Sea Bubble]]'', but became pregnant and withdrew from the production. Several weeks later, she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months.<ref>Capus 2003. pp. 138–139.</ref> She joined Olivier for a European tour of ''Titus Andronicus'', but the tour was marred by Leigh's frequent outbursts against Olivier and other members of the company. After their return to London, her former husband, Leigh Holman, who could still exert a strong influence on her, stayed with the Oliviers and helped calm her.<ref>Walker 1987, p. 222.</ref>

In 1958 considering her marriage to be over, Leigh began a relationship with the actor [[John Merivale|Jack Merivale]], who knew of Leigh's medical condition and assured Olivier he would care for her. In 1959, when she achieved a success with the Noël Coward comedy ''[[Look After Lulu!]]'', ''[[The Times]]'' critic described her as "beautiful, delectably cool and matter of fact, she is mistress of every situation".<ref>Edwards 1978, pp. 219–234, 239.</ref>

In 1960 she and Olivier divorced and Olivier soon married actress [[Joan Plowright]].<ref>Spoto 2001, p. 301.</ref> In his autobiography, Olivier discussed the years of strain they had experienced because of Leigh's illness: "Throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness&nbsp;– an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble."<ref name="Laurence"/>

==Final years and death==
[[File:Vivien Leigh 1958.jpg|right|thumb|Leigh photographed in London, 1958]]

Merivale proved to be a stabilising influence for Leigh, but despite her apparent contentment, she was quoted by [[Radie Harris]] as confiding that she "would rather have lived a short life with Larry [Olivier] than face a long one without him".<ref>Walker 1987, p. 290.</ref> Her first husband, Leigh Holman, also spent considerable time with her. Merivale joined her for a tour of Australia, New Zealand and Latin America that lasted from July 1961 until May 1962, and Leigh enjoyed positive reviews without sharing the spotlight with Olivier.<ref>Walker 1987,pp. 258–259.</ref> Though she was still beset by bouts of depression, she continued to work in the theatre and, in 1963, won a [[Tony Award]] for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in ''[[Tovarich (musical)|Tovarich]]''. She also appeared in the films ''[[The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone]]'' (1961) and ''[[Ship of Fools (film)|Ship of Fools]]'' (1965).<ref>Edwards 1978, pp. 266–272.</ref>

Leigh's last screen appearance in ''Ship of Fools'' was both a triumph and emblematic of her illnesses taking root. Producer and director Stanley Kramer who ended up with the film, planned to star Leigh but was initially unaware of the fragile mental and physical health of his star.{{refn|At one point in the pre-production, Katharine Hepburn was considered for the role of Mary Treadwell, but dropped out and was replaced by Leigh.<ref>Andersen 1997, pp. 552–553.</ref>|group=Note}} In later recounting her work, Kramer remembered her courage in taking on the difficult role, "She was ill, and the courage to go ahead, the courage to make the film&nbsp;– was almost unbelievable."<ref name="Articles">Steinberg, Jay.

In May 1967 Leigh was rehearsing to appear with [[Michael Redgrave]] in [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[A Delicate Balance (play)|A Delicate Balance]]'' when she suffered a recurrence of tuberculosis.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1870&dat=19670709&id=NXIeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nckEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3858,1664232 "Actress Vivien Leigh, Who Achieved Fame a Scarlett O'Hara, Dies at 53."] ''Daytona Beach Sunday News-Journal'', 9 July 1967.</ref> Following several weeks of rest, she seemed to recover. On the night of 7 July 1967, Merivale left her as usual at their Eaton Square flat, to perform in a play, and returned home just before midnight to find her asleep. About 30 minutes later, he returned to the bedroom and discovered her body on the floor. She had been attempting to walk to the bathroom and, as her lungs filled with liquid, they collapsed and she suffocated.<ref>Edwards 1978, pp. 304–305.</ref> Merivale first contacted her family and the next day, was able to reach Olivier, who was receiving treatment for [[prostate cancer]] in a nearby hospital.<ref name="Edwards p. 284">Edwards 1978, p. 284.</ref> In his autobiography, Olivier described his "grievous anguish" as he immediately travelled to Leigh's residence, to find that Merivale had moved her body onto the bed.

==Legacy==
Leigh was considered one of the most beautiful actresses of her day, and her directors emphasised this in most of her films. When asked if she believed her beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress, she said, "People think that if you look fairly reasonable, you can't possibly act, and as I only care about acting, I think beauty can be a great handicap, if you really want to look like the part you're playing, which isn't necessarily like you."<ref name = "ActorTalk"/>

Director George Cukor described Leigh as a "consummate actress, hampered by beauty",<ref>Shipman 1988, p. 126.</ref> and Laurence Olivier said that critics should "give her credit for being an actress and not go on forever letting their judgments be distorted by her great beauty."<ref>Coleman 2005, p. 227.</ref> Garson Kanin shared their viewpoint and described Leigh as "a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievements as an actress. Great beauties are infrequently great actresses&nbsp;– simply because they don't need to be. Vivien was different; ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired."<ref>Shipman 1988, p. 125.</ref>

Leigh explained that she played "as many different parts as possible" in an attempt to learn her craft and to dispel prejudice about her abilities. She believed that comedy was more difficult to play than drama because it required more precise timing and said that more emphasis should be placed upon comedy as part of an actor's training. Nearing the end of her career, which ranged from Noël Coward comedies to Shakespearean tragedies, she observed, "It's much easier to make people cry than to make them laugh."<ref name = "ActorTalk"/>

Her early performances brought her immediate success in Britain, but she remained largely unknown in other parts of the world until the release of ''Gone with the Wind''. In December 1939, film critic [[Frank Nugent]] wrote in ''The New York Times'', "Miss Leigh's Scarlett has vindicated the absurd talent quest that indirectly turned her up. She is so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable",<ref>Haver 1980, p. 305.</ref> and as her fame escalated, she was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as Scarlett. In 1969 critic [[Andrew Sarris]] commented that the success of the film had been largely due to "the inspired casting" of Leigh,<ref>Ebert, Roger. [http://www.rogerebert.com/cast-and-crew/vivien-leigh "Vivien Leigh."] ''Roger Ebert.com'' quoting [[Andrew Sarris]], ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968''. Retrieved: 6 January 2006.</ref> and in 1998, wrote that "she lives in our minds and memories as a dynamic force rather than as a static presence".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/reviews/980503.03woodlt.htmland "Reviews on the Web", quoting [[Andrew Sarris]] in ''You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet, The American Talking Film: History & Memory, 1927–1949''."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 May 1998. Retrieved: 11 January 2006.</ref> Film historian and critic [[Leonard Maltin]] described the film as one of the all-time greats, writing in 1998 that Leigh "brilliantly played" her role.<ref>Maltin 1997, p. 522.</ref>

Her performance in the West End production of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', described by the theatre writer [[Phyllis Hartnoll]] as "proof of greater powers as an actress than she had hitherto shown", led to a lengthy period during which she was considered one of the finest actresses in British theatre.<ref>Hartnoll 1972, p. 301.</ref> Discussing the subsequent film version, [[Pauline Kael]] wrote that Leigh and Marlon Brando gave "two of the greatest performances ever put on film" and that Leigh's was "one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke both fear and pity."<ref>Kael 1982, p. 564.</ref>

Her greatest critic was Kenneth Tynan who ridiculed Leigh's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 production of ''Titus Andronicus'', commenting that she "receives the news that she is about to be ravished on her husband's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber."<ref>Ellis, Samantha. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2003/jun/25/theatre.samanthaellis "Peter Brook's Titus Andronicus, August 1955 (quoting Kenneth Tynan)."] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 23 June 2003. Retrieved: 7 January 2005.</ref> He was also critical of her reinterpretation of [[Lady Macbeth (Shakespeare)|Lady Macbeth]] in 1955, saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role.<ref name="Bean p. 181">Bean 2013, p. 181.</ref> After her death, however, Tynan revised his opinion, describing his earlier criticism as "one of the worst errors of judgment" he had ever made. He came to believe that Leigh's interpretation, in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, "made more sense&nbsp;... than the usual battle-axe" portrayal of the character.{{refn|In a 1983 interview after his death, Kenneth Tynan's widow derided her husband's vindictive campaign against Leigh as "completely unnecessary". Olivier dismissed it as jealousy; Leigh, however, was adversely affected by his comments.<ref name="Bean p. 181"/>|group=Note}} In a survey of theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh's death, several named her performance as Lady Macbeth as one of her greatest achievements in theatre.<ref>Taylor 1984, p. 99.</ref>

In 1969 a plaque to Leigh was placed in the Actors' Church, [[St Paul's, Covent Garden]], London. In 1985 a portrait of her was included in a series of United Kingdom postage stamps, along with Sir Alfred Hitchcock, Sir [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Peter Sellers]] and David Niven to commemorate "British Film Year".<ref>Walker 1987, pp. 303, 304.</ref> In April 2013 she was again included in another series, this time celebrating the 100th anniversary of her birth, achieving the rare accolade for a non-royal of appearing on British stamps on more than one occasion.

The [[British Library]] in London purchased the papers of Laurence Olivier from his estate in 1999. Known as ''The Laurence Olivier Archive'', the collection includes many of Vivien Leigh's personal papers, including numerous letters she wrote to Olivier. The papers of Vivien Leigh, including letters, photographs, contracts and diaries, are owned by her daughter, Mrs. Suzanne Farrington. In 1994 the [[National Library of Australia]] purchased a photograph album, monogrammed "L & V O" and believed to have belonged to the Oliviers, containing 573 photographs of the couple during their 1948 tour of Australia. It is now held as part of the record of the history of the performing arts in Australia.<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/gateways/archive/14/14.html#laurieviv "Laurence Olivier/Vivien Leigh."] ''Gateways: National Library of Australia''.
