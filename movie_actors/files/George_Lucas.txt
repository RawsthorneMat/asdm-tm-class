Lucas is one of the American film industry's most financially successful filmmakers, and has been nominated for four [[Academy Awards]].

==Early life==
Lucas was born and raised in [[Modesto, California]], the son of Dorothy Ellinore Lucas (née Bomberger; 1913–1989) and George Walton Lucas, Sr. (1913–1991), who owned a stationery store.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/89/George-Lucas.html|title=George Lucas Biography (1944-)|work=filmreference.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.americanancestors.org/third-set-of-ten-hollywood/ No. 83 Royal Descents, Notable Kin, and Printed Sources: A Third Set of Ten Hollywood Figures (or Groups Thereof), with a Coda on Two Directors<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Growing up, Lucas had a passion for cars and motor racing, which eventually serve as inspiration for his films ''[[1:42.08]]'' and ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Long before Lucas became obsessed with film making, he wanted to be a race-car driver, and he spent most of his high school years racing on the underground circuit at fairgrounds and hanging out at garages.  On June 12, 1962, while driving his souped-up [[Autobianchi Bianchina]], another driver broadsided him, flipping over his car, nearly killing him, causing him to lose interest in racing as a career.<ref name=pollockskywalking>Pollock, Dale, ''Skywalking: The Life and Films of George Lucas'',  Harmony Books, New York, 1983, ISBN 0-517-54677-9.</ref><ref>[http://www.oprah.com/own-oprahs-next-chapter/Filmmaker-George-Lucas-Near-Death-Experience-Video "Filmmaker George Lucas' Near-Death Experience"], ''oprah.com'', January 22, 2012. Retrieved October 13, 2012.</ref> He attended [[Modesto Junior College]], where he studied [[anthropology]], sociology, and literature, amongst other subjects.<ref name=pollockskywalking /> He also began filming with an 8&nbsp;mm camera, including filming car races.<ref name=pollockskywalking />

At this time, Lucas and his friend John Plummer became interested in [[Canyon Cinema]]: screenings of [[Underground film|underground]], [[avant-garde]] 16&nbsp;mm filmmakers like [[Jordan Belson]], [[Stan Brakhage]] and [[Bruce Conner]].<ref name=WiredMay2005>Steve Silberman, [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.05/lucas.html "Life After Darth"], ''Wired'', May 2005. Retrieved October 11, 2012.</ref> Lucas and Plummer also saw classic European films of the time, including [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'', [[François Truffaut]]'s ''[[Jules and Jim|Jules et Jim]]'', and [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]''.<ref name=WiredMay2005 /> "That's when George really started exploring," Plummer said.<ref name=WiredMay2005 /> Through his interest in [[autocross]] racing, Lucas met renowned [[cinematographer]] [[Haskell Wexler]], another race enthusiast.<ref name=pollockskywalking /><ref name=WiredMay2005 /> Wexler, later to work with Lucas on several occasions, was impressed by Lucas' talent.<ref name=pollockskywalking /> "George had a very good eye, and he thought visually," he recalled.<ref name=WiredMay2005 />

Lucas then transferred to the [[University of Southern California]] [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|School of Cinematic Arts]]. USC was one of the earliest universities to have a school devoted to [[motion picture film]]. During the years at USC, George Lucas shared a dorm room with [[Randal Kleiser]]. Along with classmates such as [[Walter Murch]], [[Hal Barwood]] and [[John Milius]], they became a clique of film students known as [[The Dirty Dozen (filmmaking)|The Dirty Dozen]]. He also became good friends with fellow acclaimed student filmmaker and future ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' collaborator, [[Steven Spielberg]]. Lucas was deeply influenced by the Filmic Expression course taught at the school by filmmaker [[Lester Novros]] which concentrated on the non-narrative elements of Film Form like color, light, movement, space, and time. Another inspiration was the Serbian montagist (and dean of the USC Film Department) [[Slavko Vorkapich]], a film theoretician who made stunning [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] sequences for Hollywood studio features at [[MGM]], [[RKO]], and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. Vorkapich taught the autonomous nature of the cinematic art form, emphasizing the unique dynamic quality of movement and kinetic energy inherent in motion pictures.

Lucas saw many inspiring films in class, particularly the visual films coming out of the [[National Film Board of Canada]] like [[Arthur Lipsett]]'s ''[[21-87]]'', the French-Canadian [[cameraman]] [[Jean-Claude Labrecque]]'s [[cinéma vérité]] ''60 Cycles'', the work of [[Norman McLaren]], and the documentaries of [[Claude Jutra]]. Lucas fell madly in love with [[pure cinema]] and quickly became prolific at making 16&nbsp;mm nonstory noncharacter visual tone poems and cinéma vérité with such titles as ''[[Look at Life (film)|Look at Life]]'', ''[[Herbie (film)|Herbie]]'', ''[[1:42.08]]'', ''[[The Emperor (film)|The Emperor]]'', ''[[Anyone Lived in a Pretty How Town (film)|Anyone Lived in a Pretty (how) Town]]'', ''[[Filmmaker (film)|Filmmaker]]'', and ''[[6-18-67]]''. He was passionate and interested in camerawork and editing, defining himself as a filmmaker as opposed to being a director, and he loved making abstract visual films that created emotions purely through cinema.<ref name=WiredMay2005 />

After graduating with a bachelor of [[fine arts]] in film in 1967, he tried joining the [[United States Air Force]] as an officer, but he was immediately turned down because of his numerous speeding tickets. He was later [[Conscription|drafted]] by the Army for military service in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], but he was exempted from service after medical tests showed he had [[diabetes]], the disease that killed his paternal grandfather.

In 1967, Lucas re-enrolled as a USC graduate student in film production.<ref name=FGL>{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/profile/george-lucas |title=George Lucas |date=September 2012 |work=Forbes |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}</ref> Working as a teaching instructor for a class of [[U.S. Navy]] students who were being taught documentary cinematography, Lucas directed the short film ''[[Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB]]'', which won first prize at the 1967–68 National Student [[film festival]], and was later adapted into his first full-length feature film, ''[[THX 1138]]''. Lucas was awarded a student scholarship by [[Warner Bros.]] to observe and work on the making of a film of his choosing. The film he chose was ''[[Finian's Rainbow (film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1968) which was being directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who was revered among film school students of the time as a cinema graduate who had "made it" in Hollywood. In 1969, George Lucas was one of the camera operators on the classic Rolling Stones concert film ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]''.

==Film career==

George Lucas is a filmmaker, with a film career dominated by writing and production. Aside from the nine short films he made in the 1960s, he also directed six major features. His work from 1971 and 1977 as a writer-director, which established him as a major figure in Hollywood, consists of just three films: ''[[THX 1138]]'', ''[[American Graffiti]]'', and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''. There was a 22-year hiatus between the original ''Star Wars'' film and his only other feature-film directing credits, the three ''Star Wars'' prequels.

Lucas acted as a writer and executive producer on another successful Hollywood film franchise, the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' series. In addition, he established his own effects company, [[Industrial Light and Magic]] (ILM), to make the original ''Star Wars'' film. The company is now one of the most successful in the industry.

Lucas co-founded the studio [[American Zoetrope]] with Coppola—whom he met during his internship at Warner Bros.—hoping to create a liberating environment for filmmakers to direct outside the perceived oppressive control of the Hollywood [[studio system]].<ref>{{cite news|title=American Zoetrope: In a galaxy not from Hollywood ...|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/17/zoetrope-coppola-lucas-star-wars|accessdate=September 25, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=November 17, 2011}}</ref> His first full-length feature film produced by the studio, ''[[THX 1138]]'', was not a success. Lucas then created his own company, [[Lucasfilm, Ltd.]], and directed ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1973). His new-found wealth and reputation enabled him to develop a story set in space. Even so, he encountered difficulties getting ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' made. It was only because [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]], at [[20th Century Fox]] liked ''American Graffiti'' that he forced through a production and distribution deal for the film, which ended up restoring Fox to financial stability after a number of flops.<ref>[[Tom Shone]]: ''[[Blockbuster (2004 book)|Blockbuster]]: How Hollywood Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Summer'' (2004). London, Simon & Schuster UK. ISBN 0-7432-6838-5. Chapter 2.</ref>

''Star Wars'' quickly became the [[list of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all-time]], displaced five years later by Spielberg's ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. After the success of ''American Graffiti'' and prior to the beginning of filming on ''Star Wars'', Lucas was encouraged to renegotiate for a higher fee for writing and directing ''Star Wars'' than the $150,000 agreed.<ref name=pollockskywalking /> He declined to do so, instead negotiating for advantage in some of the as-yet-unspecified parts of his contract with Fox, in particular ownership of licensing and merchandising rights (for [[novelization]]s, T-shirts, toys, etc.) and contractual arrangements for sequels.<ref name=pollockskywalking /> The studio was unconcerned to relinquish these rights, as its last major attempt in the field, with the 1967 film, ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]]'', had proved a discouraging failure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Mark|title=Pictures at a Revolution: Five Films and the Birth of the New Hollywood|year=2008|publisher=Penguin Press|pages=378–9}}</ref> Lucas exploited merchandising rights wisely, and Lucasfilm has earned hundreds of millions of dollars from licensed games, toys, and collectibles created for the franchise.<ref name=pollockskywalking />

[[File:Lucas - Henson - 1986.jpg|thumb|left|Director [[Jim Henson]] (left) and Lucas (right) working on ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'' in 1986]]
Over the two decades after the first ''Star Wars'' film, Lucas worked extensively as a writer and/or producer, including the many Star Wars spinoffs made for film, TV, and other media. Lucas acted as executive producer for the next two ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, commissioning [[Irvin Kershner]] to direct ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', and [[Richard Marquand]] to direct ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', while receiving a story credit on the former and sharing a screenwriting credit with [[Lawrence Kasdan]] on the latter.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.empireonline.com/features/star-wars-making-of-empire-strikes-back|title= The Making of Empire Strikes Back|date=June 2002|work=Empire Magazine|accessdate=May 8, 2014}}</ref> He also acted as executive producer and story writer on all four of the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' films, which he convinced his colleague and good friend, [[Steven Spielberg]], to direct. Other notable projects as a producer or executive producer in this period include [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa's]] ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980), Lawrence Kasdan's ''[[Body Heat]]'' (1981), [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'' (1986), [[Godfrey Reggio]]'s ''[[Powaqqatsi]]'' (1986) and the [[animated film]] ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' (1988). There were also less successful projects, however, including ''[[More American Graffiti]]'' (1979), the ill-fated ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]'' (1986), which was the biggest flop of his career; ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'' (1988, which Lucas also wrote); and Coppola's ''[[Tucker: The Man and His Dream]]'' (1988).

From 1992 to 1996, Lucas served as executive producer for the television spinoff ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]''. In 1997, as part of the 20th anniversary of ''Star Wars,'' Lucas returned to his trilogy and made numerous modifications using newly available digital technology, releasing them in theaters as the ''Star Wars Special Edition''. For DVD releases in 2004, the series received further revisions to make them congruent with the prequel trilogy. Besides the additions to the Star Wars franchise, in 2004 a ''George Lucas Director's Cut'' of ''THX 1138'' was released, with the film re-cut and containing a number of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] revisions.

The animation studio [[Pixar]] was founded as the Graphix Group, one third of the Computer Division of [[Lucasfilm]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pixar Story|url=http://rfostermsm.edublogs.org/2011/04/20/pixar-story/|date=April 20, 2011|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}</ref> Pixar's early computer graphics research resulted in groundbreaking effects in films such as ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''<ref name="PixarStory">{{Cite journal| last =Hormby | first =Thomas | author-link = | last2 = | publisher =Low End Mac| first2 = | author2-link = | title =The Pixar Story: Dick Shoup, Alex Schure, George Lucas, Steve Jobs, and Disney | date =January 22, 2007 | url =http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/0123.html | accessdate =March 1, 2007 | postscript =<!--None--> }}</ref> and ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]'',<ref name="PixarStory"/> and the group was purchased in 1986 by [[Steve Jobs]] shortly after he left Apple after a power struggle at [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]. Jobs paid US$5 million to Lucas and put US$5 million as capital into the company. The sale reflected Lucas' desire to stop the cash flow losses from his 7-year research projects associated with new entertainment technology tools, as well as his company's new focus on creating entertainment products rather than tools. A contributing factor was cash-flow difficulties following Lucas' 1983 divorce concurrent with the sudden dropoff in revenues from ''[[Star Wars]]'' licenses following the release of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.

The sound equipped system, [[THX]] Ltd, was founded by Lucas and [[Tomlinson Holman]].<ref name=Softpedia>Truta, Filip Truta (May 5, 2011).

[[Skywalker Sound]] and [[Industrial Light & Magic]], are the sound and visual effects subdivisions of Lucasfilm, while Lucasfilm Games, later renamed [[LucasArts]], produces products for the gaming industry.

In 1994, Lucas began work on the screenplay for the prequel ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'', which would be the first film he had directed in over two decades. ''The Phantom Menace'' was released in 1999, beginning a new trilogy of ''Star Wars'' films. Lucas also directed ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' which were released in 2002 and 2005, respectively. Numerous critics considered these prequel films inferior to the original trilogy,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020510/REVIEWS/205100305/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Star Wars – Episode II: Attack Of The Clones}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_i_the_phantom_menace/|title=Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace|date=May 9, 1999|work=rottentomatoes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_ii_attack_of_the_clones/|title=Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones 3D|date=May 16, 2002|work=rottentomatoes.com}}</ref> though they were box office successes nevertheless.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=starwars.htm | title= Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace  (1999) | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=starwars2.htm | title = Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones  (2002) | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=June 21, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=starwars3.htm | title = Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith  (2005) | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>

George Lucas also collaborated with Steven Spielberg in the production of the 2008 film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''. Lucas later worked as the story-writer and executive producer for the 2012 film ''[[Red Tails]]'', a war film based on the exploits of the [[Tuskegee Airmen]], a group of [[African America]] pilots in the [[United States Army Air Force]] during the [[Second World War]]. He also took over direction of reshoots while director [[Anthony Hemingway]] worked on other projects. Lucas is working on his first musical, an untitled CGI project being produced at [[Skywalker Ranch]]. [[Kevin Munroe]] directed the movie while David Berenbaum wrote the screenplay for ''Red Tails''.<ref name="Heat Vision">{{cite web |url=http://www.heatvisionblog.com/2010/01/george-lucas-cgi-musical-kevin-munroe.html|title='George Lucas producing a CGI musical!

Following the conclusion of the Star Wars prequel trilogy in 2005, George Lucas continued to work on other Star Wars-related projects. Lucas worked as the executive producer for ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', an animated television series on [[Cartoon Network]], which was preceded by a [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|feature film of the same name]].  As of 2014, he is currently working as a creative consultant on the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy]], with the first movie ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' being scheduled for release on December 18, 2015.

As creative consultant on the film, Lucas's involvement included attending early story meetings; according to Lucas, "I mostly say, 'You can't do this. You can do that.'
