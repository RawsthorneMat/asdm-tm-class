'''Jeffrey "Jeff" Hunter''' (November 25, 1926 – May 27, 1969) was an American film and television actor and producer. Hunter is known for his roles as the sidekick to [[John Wayne]]'s character in ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]],'' as [[Jesus Christ]] in the biblical film ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]],'' and as Capt. [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]] in the original [[pilot episode]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and the series' only two-part episode, [[The Menagerie (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Menagerie]].

==Early life==
Hunter was born '''Henry Herman “Hank” McKinnies, Jr.''', in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], and after 1930 reared in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], where he graduated from [[Whitefish Bay High School]]. He began acting in local theater and radio in his early teens. He served [[wikt:stateside|stateside]] in the [[United States Navy]], in [[World War II]], then from 1946 to 1949 studied theatre at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Illinois]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Jeffrey Hunter Died Tuesday From Home Fall|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1665&dat=19690528&id=je0eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PyQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4189,4450315|newspaper=The Times-News|date=May 28, 1969|page=3}}</ref>

==Acting career==
[[Image:The searchers Ford Trailer screenshot (32).jpg|thumb|left||200px|Jeffrey Hunter as Martin Pawley in ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'']]
In 1950, while he was a [[Postgraduate education|graduate student]] in [[radio]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and appearing in a college play, Hunter was spotted by talent scouts and offered a two-year motion picture contract by [[20th Century Fox]] that was eventually extended to 1959. He made his film debut in a bit part in 1950's ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]''. He later graduated to starring roles in ''[[Red Skies of Montana]]'' (1952), and ''[[Sailor of the King]]'' (1953).

A loan-out to co-star with John Wayne in the title roles of the now-classic western ''The Searchers'' (1956), began the first of three pictures he made with director [[John Ford]]; the other two being ''[[The Last Hurrah]]'' (1958) starring [[Spencer Tracy]] and as lawyer Tom Cantrell in ''[[Sergeant Rutledge]]'' (1960). The same year as ''The Searchers'', Hunter also co-starred with top-billed [[Fess Parker]] in [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney]]'s ''[[The Great Locomotive Chase]]'', based on an actual 1862 historical event during the [[American Civil War]]. Ironically, according to Parker's [[Archive of American Television]] interview, Ford had originally wanted to cast Parker in Hunter's role in ''The Searchers'' but Disney refused to loan him out, something Parker didn't hear about until years later; Parker referred to his loss of that part to Jeffrey Hunter as his single biggest career setback.<ref>[http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/fess-parker Fess Parker's Archive of American Television interview]</ref>  

Ford also recommended Hunter to director [[Nicholas Ray]] for the role of [[Jesus Christ]] in ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'' (1961), a difficult part met by critical reaction that ranged from praise to ridicule. (Hunter's youthful matinee-idol looks resulted in the film's being derided as ''I Was a Teenage Jesus'' though he was thirty-four when cast in the part.)<ref>Gwilym Beckerlegge, ''From Sacred Text to Internet'', Ashgate, 2001, p.268.</ref> Joining an all-star cast in the World War II battle epic ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'', Hunter provided a climactic heroic moment playing a sergeant who is killed while leading a successful attempt to breach the defense wall atop [[Omaha Beach]] in [[Normandy]].
[[File:Jeffrey Hunter Temple Houston 1963.JPG|thumb|left|Jeffrey Hunter as ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|Temple Houston]]'' (1963)]]
Having guest-starred on television dramas since the mid-1950s, Hunter was then offered a two-year contract by [[Warner Bros.]] studio boss [[Jack Webb]] that included starring as circuit-riding Texas [[lawyer]] [[Temple Lea Houston]], the youngest son of [[Sam Houston]], in the [[NBC]] series ''[[Temple Houston (TV series)|Temple Houston]]'' (1963–1964), which Hunter's production company co-produced. [[Jack Elam]] was his co-star, as gunslinger-turned-marshal George Taggart.<ref name=wtha>Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 106-109</ref>

Hunter described the Temple Houston that he sought to emulate as having "many sides to his character. He was a flamboyant orator; he was a bit of a dandy; he was tough; he was gentle; he was an excellent marksman," all features which gave the series greater latitude with a western format. Houston was also described as follows: He would ride, shoot, fight, drink, and love with the best of them and maybe better than most. The modesty that he displays in day-to-day life would disappear as soon as he enters a courtroom, becoming the flamboyant attorney famous throughout the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]."<ref name=wtha/>

''Temple Houston'' proved illusory for his long-term career prospects. Hunter thought that the series had found its voice beginning with the twelfth episode, "Enough Rope", by having adopted the light-hearted approach of ABC's former ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' western series, with [[James Garner]].<ref name=Milwaukee>J. D. Spiro. "Happy in Hollywood".  ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]''.  4 July 1965.</ref> As Hunter explained the change in format, the series was "conceived in humor and delivered in dead seriousness. Then, about halfway through the season, NBC decided to return to the tongue-in-cheek approach. By that time it was too late. The big joke around town was that the series was about a [[synagogue]] in Texas."<ref name=wtha/>

[[Ruta Lee]], who guest starred as Lucy Tolliver in "Enough Rope", said of Hunter: "He was one of the prettiest people that ever was put on the screen. God, he was gorgeous."<ref name=wtha/> Another Hunter friend, actor [[Van Williams]], a native of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], who also guest starred in the series, said: "Things didn't go right for him, and they should have, because if anybody deserved to be a big star, it was Jeffrey Hunter."<ref name=wtha/>

In taking the ''Temple Houston'' role, Hunter was compelled by a scheduling conflict to bow out of John Ford's  final western film, ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''.<ref name=wtha/>

[[Image:Kingofkings10.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Jeffrey Hunter as [[Jesus]] in ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'']]

Although ''Temple Houston'' did not survive beyond twenty-six weeks, Hunter accepted the lead role of [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Captain Christopher Pike]] in "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]," the first [[Television pilot|pilot episode]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. [[Clegg Hoyt]], Hunter's co-star in ''[[The True Story of Jesse James]]'', appeared in this pilot as Pitcairn, the transporter chief of the fictitious [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS Enterprise]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Clegg_Hoyt|title=Clegg Hoyt|publisher=en.memory-alpha.org|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref> Hunter declined to film a second ''Star Trek'' pilot requested by NBC in 1965, and decided to concentrate on motion pictures such as ''[[Brainstorm (1965 film)|Brainstorm]]''.<ref>''Star Trek'' creator and producer [[Gene Roddenberry]] wrote to him on April 5, 1965:
<blockquote>I am told you have decided not to go ahead with ''Star Trek''. This has to be your own decision, of course, and I must respect it. You may be certain I hold no grudge or ill feelings and expect to continue to reflect publicly and privately the high regard I learned for you during the production of our pilot.</blockquote>

With the demise of the studio contract system in the early 1960s and the [[outsourcing]] of much feature production, Hunter, like many other leading men of the 1950s, found work in [[B movie]]s produced in [[Italy]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Mexico]], with the occasional television guest part in Hollywood.<ref name=ferguson/>

==Personal life==
Hunter's first marriage from 1950 to 1955 to actress [[Barbara Rush]] produced a son, Christopher (born 1952). From 1957 to 1967, Hunter was married to model Dusty Bartlett. He adopted her son, Steele, and the couple had two other children, Todd and Scott. In February 1969, he married actress [[Emily McLaughlin]] to whom he remained married until his death only three months later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jeffrey Hunter, Actor, Dies|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19690528&id=PFpIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rQEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7323,330348|newspaper=Toledo Blade|date=May 28, 1969|page=7}}</ref> 

==Death==
While in Spain in 1969 to film ''[[¡Viva América!]]'', a story of the Chicago Mafia, Hunter was injured in an on-set explosion when a car window near him, which had been rigged to explode outward, accidentally exploded inward.<ref name=ferguson/>  Hunter sustained a serious [[concussion]]. According to Hunter's wife Emily, he "...went into shock" on the plane ride back to the United States after filming and "..couldn't speak. He could hardly move." After landing, Hunter was taken to [[Good Samaritan Hospital (Los Angeles)|Good Samaritan Hospital]] in Los Angeles but doctors could not find any serious injuries save for a displaced vertebra and a concussion.<ref name=gilpatrick>{{cite book|last=Gilpatrick|first=Kristin|title=Famous Wisconsin Film Stars|year=2002|publisher=Badger Books Inc.|isbn=1-878-56986-4|page=73}}</ref>  

On the night of May 26, 1969, Hunter suffered an [[intracranial hemorrhage]] while on a three-stair set of steps at his home in [[Van Nuys, California|Van Nuys]], California.<ref name=ferguson/><ref name=gilpatrick/> He fell, knocked over a planter, and struck his head on a banister, fracturing his skull.<ref name=times>{{cite news|title=Hunter Lost His Balance|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&dat=19690529&id=pPkrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xMYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1111,5071292|newspaper=Times Daily|date=May 29, 1969|page=10}}</ref>  He was found unconscious by his wife and taken to Valley Presbyterian Hospital where he underwent brain surgery to repair his injuries.  He died at about 9:30 a.m. the following morning at the age of 42.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jeff Hunter, Movie Actor, Dies Tuesday|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19690528&id=z9oeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=92UEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6255,7053869|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=May 28, 1969|page=4}}</ref> 

Hunter's funeral was held at St Mark's Episcopal Church in Van Nuys on May 31 after which he was interred at Glen Haven Memorial Park, in [[Sylmar, California|Sylmar]], California.<ref name=times/><ref>{{cite book|last=Ellenberger|first=Allan R.|title=Celebrities in Los Angeles Cemeteries: A Directory|year=2001|publisher=McFarland & Company Incorporated Pub|isbn=0-786-40983-5|page=102}}</ref>
