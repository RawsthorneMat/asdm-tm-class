===''Taxi Driver'' and teenage stardom (1976–1981)===
While Foster was already a successful actor by the age of ten, her breakthrough into stardom did not take place until 1976, when she appeared in five films, two of which were chosen for competition at the [[1976 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]] in May. These were Martin Scorsese's controversial drama ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and [[Alan Parker]]'s feature film debut, [[gangster film|gangster]] [[musical film|musical]] ''[[Bugsy Malone]]''. In the former, Foster played Iris, a child prostitute who becomes the obsession of the film's disturbed main character, [[Travis Bickle]], played by [[Robert de Niro]]. The role was highly controversial and Foster's older sister Connie had to act as her [[body double]] in sexually suggestive scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/05/22/magazine/22wtwt-sisters-on-a-movie-set.html?_r=0|title=Sisters on a Movie Set, New York, 1975|date=May 22, 2011|page=|work=New York Times|first=Kathy|last=Ryan|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}</ref> It was both a commercial and critical success, winning the [[Palme d'Or]] and earning Foster an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] nomination. She later commented that the film "completely changed my life", and that playing Iris was "the first time anyone asked me to create a character that wasn't myself. It was the first time I realized that acting wasn't this hobby you just sort of did, but that there was actually some craft."<ref name="NYT 1991"/> In ''Bugsy Malone'', which had an all-teen cast, Foster played Tallulah, gangster's moll and the star of a [[speakeasy]] show. It was not a commercial success, but earned mainly positive reviews. For her performances in the two films, Foster was awarded two [[British Academy Film Awards]] in 1977: the [[BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role]].<ref name="NYT 1991"/> {{quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="I think all of us when we look back on our childhood, we always think of it as somebody else.

Foster made the transition to more mature roles as an adult, but it was not without initial difficulty, as several of the films in her early adult career in the 1980s, such as ''[[The Hotel New Hampshire (film)|The Hotel New Hampshire]]'',<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=thehotelnewhampshire.htm "The Hotel New Hampshire"].

Due to this, she had to audition for the main role of gang rape victim Sarah Tobias in ''[[The Accused (1988 film)|The Accused]]'', which was to become her breakthrough role as an adult. Based on a true story, the film depicts Tobias' struggle to receive justice for herself. It received mainly positive reviews and earned Foster a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award]] and an [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]] as well as a nomination for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]].<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=accused.htm "The Accused (1988)"].

The following year, Foster founded a production company called Egg Pictures in Los Angeles, which produced primarily [[independent film]]s for distribution by other companies. She said that she did not have the ambition to produce "big mainstream popcorn" movies and, as a child, independent films had made her more interested in the movie business than mainstream ones.<ref name="SperlingReich" /> The company was closed down in 2001.

Foster's next roles included playing a prostitute in [[Woody Allen]]'s comedy ''[[Shadows and Fog]]'' and Laurel Sommersby in the [[American Civil War]] drama ''[[Sommersby]]''. She starred in two films in 1994, first in the commercially successful western spoof ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=maverick.htm |title=Maverick (1994) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=September 28, 1994 |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref> and later in ''[[Nell (film)|Nell]]'', in which she played an isolated woman, raised speaking an invented language, who finds it difficult to be confronted with civilization for the first time. Her performance in ''Nell'' earned her nominations for her fourth Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and an [[MTV Movie Award]], and won her a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] and a [[People's Choice Award]], among others.

The following year Foster released her second film as a director, ''[[Home for the Holidays (film)|Home for the Holidays]]'' (1995), a [[black comedy]] starring [[Holly Hunter]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]].

On March 30, 1981, he [[Reagan assassination attempt|attempted to assassinate]] U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] (shooting and wounding Reagan and three others) and claimed his motive was to impress Foster, then a Yale freshman. The media stormed the Yale campus in April "like a cavalry invasion," and followed Foster relentlessly.<ref>Schneider, Karen S.

Foster's only public reactions to the incident up to that time were a press conference afterwards and an article titled "Why Me?" that she wrote for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' in December 1982.
