==Early life==
Stacy was born Maurice William Elias in [[Los Angeles]] to an [[Irish people|Irish]]-[[Scottish people|Scottish]] waitress and a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]]-American [[bookmaker]].<ref name=people/>

==Career==
Stacy made his film debut ''[[Sayonara]]'' in 1957, and his television debut in ''[[Highway Patrol (TV series)|Highway Patrol]]''. He had a recurring role as "Fred" in ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' from 1958 to 1963. During the 1960s he made guest appearances in television shows, including ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Have Gun - Will Travel]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', and ''[[Combat!]]''. In 1966 he appeared in the final episode of ''[[Perry Mason]]'' as actor and murder victim Barry Conrad in "The Case of the Final Fade-Out". 

Stacy is perhaps best remembered as a star of the [[Western (genre)|western]] series ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'', along with [[Andrew Duggan]], [[Wayne Maunder]], and [[Paul Brinegar]]. ''Lancer'' aired on [[CBS]] from 1968 to 1970. Stacy played the character "Johnny Madrid Lancer", a former gunslinger, the son of Duggan's character, Murdoch Lancer. Some six years earlier, Stacy and Duggan had appeared together in the series finale, "Showdown at Oxbend", a classic drama of the fight between cattlemen and sheep herders, on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] western series, ''[[Cheyenne (1955 TV series)|Cheyenne]]'', with [[Clint Walker]] in the title role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0540144/?ref_=tt_ep_nx|title=Showdown at Oxbend|date=December 17, 1962|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref> 

Stacy acted in several motion pictures from the 1950s through the 1970s, including a minor part in the musical ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''.

===Motorcycle accident===
On September 27, 1973, Stacy was taking Claire Cox for a ride on his motorcycle in the Hollywood Hills when a drunken driver struck them. She died and Stacy lost his left arm and leg. Stacy's ex-wife, actress and singer [[Connie Stevens]], organized a 1974 celebrity gala to raise money for his expenses. The gala, whose attendees included [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Barbra Streisand]], raised $118,000 for his expenses.<ref name=people>{{cite journal|date=1996-05-13|title=Hitting Bottom|journal=People|volume=45|issue=19|page=62|issn=0093-7673|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20141272,00.html}}</ref> In 1976, he won a $1.9 million lawsuit against the bar that had served the drunk driver.<ref name=people/>

===Comeback===
After his recovery, Stacy appeared in roles created to accommodate his handicap. His comeback film was the 1975 [[Kirk Douglas]] Western ''[[Posse (1975 film)|Posse]]'', in which he was cast as newspaper editor "Harold Hellman", a part Douglas had written for him. In 1977, he starred in the TV movie ''Just a Little Inconvenience'', playing a double-amputee [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran. The role earned him his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama or Comedy Special]]. In 1980, Stacy starred in and produced the TV movie, ''My Kidnapper, My Love''. His brother, Louie Elias, a character actor and stuntman, wrote the screenplay, based on the novel by Oscar Saul, to accommodate Stacy’s handicap. Elias was also the associate producer.

Other television appearances included ''[[Hotel (TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'' (for which he was nominated for a second Primetime Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor – Drama Series|Outstanding Guest Performer in a Drama Series]]), and ''[[Highway to Heaven]]''. His last TV role was in five 1990 episodes of the cop series ''[[Wiseguy]]'', playing "Ed Rogosheske."

In November 1995, Stacy pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to a charge of molesting an 11-year-old girl.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19951209&id=e60sAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IxUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4685,3275472|title=James Stacy: TV Actor Sought By Court|date=December 9, 1995|work=Star-News|page=2A|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> On December 7, 1995, he failed to appear for sentencing in Ventura County Superior Court and was arrested the next day in a [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], hospital after having fled California. He attempted suicide by jumping off a cliff. After recovering, Stacy waived [[extradition]] and returned to California. On March 5, 1996, he received a six-year prison sentence. The prosecutor in the case initially said she believed Stacy might have been eligible for probation for the molestation, but his post arrest behavior, coupled with two arrests in June 1995 for prowling at the homes of other girls,<ref name=people/> led her to seek a prison sentence.<ref name="LA Times">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-06/local/me-43521_1_james-stacy |title=Actor Stacy Sentenced in Molestation |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 6, 1996 |accessdate=August 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&dat=19960306&id=ISpJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pAYNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3889,579538|title=Actor receives six year sentence|date=March 6, 1996|work=The Hour|page=6|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> He served his sentence at the [[California Institution for Men]] at [[Chino, California|Chino]].<ref name=people/>
