== Early life and education ==

Lars Trier was born in [[Kongens Lyngby]], north of [[Copenhagen]], the son of Inger Trier (née Høst, 1915—89). He had believed that his biological father was Ulf Trier (1907—78), until his mother revealed to him on her deathbed that he had been conceived as a result of an affair she had with her employer, Fritz Michael Hartmann. His mother considered herself a Communist, while his father was a Social Democrat, and both were committed [[naturist|nudists]],<ref name="ReferenceA">In "Trier on von Trier", by Stig Bjorkman, 2005</ref> and the young Lars went on several childhood holidays to [[nudist community|nudist camps]]. His parents regarded the disciplining of children as reactionary. Trier has noted that he was brought up in an atheist family, and that although Ulf Trier was Jewish, he was not religious. His parents did not allow much room in their household for "feelings, religion, or enjoyment," and also refused to make any rules for their children,<ref>{{cite news | first = Katja | last = Nicodemus | title = Lars von Trier, Katja Nicodemus: "I am an American woman" (17/11/2005) – signandsight | date = 10 November 2005 | url = http://www.signandsight.com/features/465.html | work = [[Die Zeit]] | accessdate =14 October 2010 | quote = I come from a family of communist nudists.

In 1979, Trier enrolled in the [[National Film School of Denmark]].<ref name="tomb">{{cite web| url= http://www.timeout.com/film/news/553.html |title=The Tomb: Lars von Trier Interview |publisher=Timeout.com |accessdate=15 July 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.timeout.com/film/news/553.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref> His peers at the film school nicknamed him "von Trier".

== Career ==

After graduation he began work on the very stylised drama ''[[The Element of Crime]]'' (''Forbrydelsens element'' 1984), which won the Technical Grand Prize at the 1984 [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lars von Trier welcome back at Cannes Film Festival|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/von-trier-welcome-back-at-cannes/5054055.article|work=Screen Daily|publisher=Media Business Insight Limited|accessdate=18 December 2013|author=Melanie Goodfellow, Andreas Wiseman|date=19 April 2013}}</ref>

His next film was ''[[Epidemic (film)|Epidemic]]'' (1987), which was also shown at [[1987 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section. The film is partly a dark science fiction-tale of a future plague epidemic, and partly chronicles two filmmakers (played by Lars von Trier and screenwriter Niels Vørsel) preparing that film, with the two storylines ultimately colliding.

For television von Trier directed ''[[Medea (1988 film)|Medea]]'' (1988), which won the [[Jean d'Arcy prize]] in France. It was based on a screenplay by [[Carl Th. Dreyer]] and starred [[Udo Kier]].

He completed the Europe-trilogy in 1991 with ''[[Europa (film)|Europa]]'' (released as ''Zentropa'' in the US), which won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Festival)|Prix du Jury]] at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref name="cannes-1991.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/91/year/1991.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Europa |accessdate=9 August 2009|work=festival-cannes.com |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/91/year/1991.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref> and picked up awards at other major [[film festival|festivals]].

In 1990 he also directed the music video for the worldwide hit "Bakerman" by [[Laid Back]].<ref>{{cite book

=== Zentropa and ''The Kingdom'' ===

In 1992 he and producer [[Peter Aalbæk Jensen]] founded the movie production company [[Zentropa|Zentropa Entertainment]], named after a train company in ''[[Europa (film)|Europa]]'', their most recent film at the time.<ref name="tomb"/> The reason for doing this was to achieve financial independence and to have total creative control. The production company has produced many movies other than von Trier's own as well as television series. It also has produced hardcore sex films: ''[[Constance (1998 film)|Constance]]'' (1998), ''[[Pink Prison]]'' (1999), ''[[HotMen CoolBoyz]]'' (2000) and ''[[All About Anna]]'' (2005).

To make money for his newly founded company,<ref name="fansite">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20091027155703/http://www.geocities.com/lars_von_trier2000/biyografi.htm |title=Lars von Trier fan site biography |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=6 October 2011}}</ref> he made ''[[The Kingdom (television)|The Kingdom]]'' (''Riget'', 1994) and ''[[The Kingdom II]]'' (''Riget II'', 1997), a pair of miniseries recorded in the Danish national hospital, the name "Riget" being a colloquial name for the hospital known as [[Rigshospitalet]] (lit. The Kingdom's Hospital) in Danish. A projected third instalment in the series was derailed by the 1998 death of [[Ernst-Hugo Järegård]], who played Helmer, one of the major characters.

=== Dogme 95 ===

In 1995, Lars von Trier and [[Thomas Vinterberg]] presented their manifesto for a new cinematic movement which they called [[Dogme&nbsp;95]]. It would however take a while before the first of these films appeared, and at this point many thought of the concept mainly as a radical idea with no future.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1996, von Trier conducted an unusual theatrical experiment in Copenhagen involving 53 actors, which he titled ''Psychomobile&nbsp;1: The World Clock''. A documentary chronicling the project was directed by [[Jesper Jargil]], and was released in 2000 with the title ''[[De Udstillede]]'' (''The Exhibited'').

Von Trier's next film, ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' (1996), the first film in von Trier's 'Golden Heart Trilogy', won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and featured [[Emily Watson]], who was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. Its grainy images and hand-held photography pointed towards Dogme&nbsp;95. The second was ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998), nominated for a [[Palme d'Or]], which he presented in person at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] notwithstanding his dislike of travelling. ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]'' (2000) was the final component of the trilogy.

As originator of the Dogme 95 concept, which has led to international interest in [[Danish film]] as a whole, he has inspired filmmakers all over the world.<ref name="Chaudhuri2005">{{cite book

=== 2000s ===

In 2000, von Trier premiered a musical featuring Icelandic musician [[Björk]], ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]''. The film won the [[Palme d'Or]] at [[2000 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]].<ref name="cannes-2000.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5140/year/2000.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Dancer in the Dark |accessdate=11 October 2009|work=festival-cannes.com |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/5140/year/2000.html |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref> The song "I've Seen It All" (which von Trier co-wrote) received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]].

''[[The Five Obstructions]]'' (2003), made by Lars von Trier and [[Jørgen Leth]], is a documentary, but also incorporates lengthy sections of [[experimental film]]s. The premise is that Lars von Trier challenges director Jørgen Leth, his friend and mentor, to remake his old experimental film ''[[The Perfect Human (film)|The Perfect Human]]'' (1967) five times, each time with a different 'obstruction' (or obstacle) specified by von Trier.<ref name=nytrev>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E4D6143EF935A15756C0A9629C8B63 |title=The Five Obstructions (2003) &#124; FILM REVIEW; A Cinematic Duel of Wits For Two Danish Directors |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date= 26 May 2004|accessdate=12 October 2010 |first=A.

He then directed two films in his announced 'US trilogy': ''[[Dogville]]'' (2003), starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and ''[[Manderlay]]'' (2005), starring [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in the same role – as Grace. Both films are extremely stylised, with the actors playing their parts on a nearly empty soundstage with little but chalk marks on the floor to indicate the sets. Both films had huge casts of major international actors ([[Harriet Andersson]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[James Caan]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Willem Dafoe]], etc.), and questioned various issues relating to American society, such as intolerance in ''Dogville'' and slavery in ''Manderlay''.

Controversy erupted on the 2004 set for ''Manderlay'' when actor [[John C. Reilly]] walked off the [[Trollhättan]], Sweden, set in late March. Reilly walked off the film when he learned that an upcoming scene involved the slaughter of a donkey for food. The film's producer says the animal—who was old and not expected to live much longer—was killed off-camera by a certified veterinarian, in accordance with Swedish law. Reilly was replaced by [[Željko Ivanek]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hohenadel |first=Kristin |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,628792,00.html |title=Departure &#124; Movies |publisher=EW.com |date= 30 April 2004 |accessdate=15 July 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120729/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,628792,00.html |archivedate=29 July 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

The US was also the scene for ''[[Dear Wendy]]'' (2005), a feature film directed by von Trier's "Dogme-brother" [[Thomas Vinterberg]] from a script by von Trier. It starred [[Jamie Bell]] and [[Bill Pullman]] and dealt with gun worship and violence in American society.

In 2006, von Trier released a Danish-language comedy film, ''[[The Boss of It All]]''. It was shot using a process that von Trier has called [[Automavision]], which involves the director choosing the best possible fixed camera position and then allowing a computer to randomly choose when to tilt, pan or zoom.

It was followed by an autobiographical film, ''{{ill|da|The Early Years: Erik Nietzsche Part 1|De unge år: Erik Nietzsche sagaen del 1}}'' (2007), scripted by von Trier but directed by [[Jacob Thuesen]], which tells the story of von Trier's years as a student at the [[National Film School of Denmark]]. It stars {{ill|da|Jonatan Spang}} as von Trier's alter ego, called "Erik Nietzsche", and is narrated by von Trier himself. All main characters in the film are based on real people from the Danish film industry,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} with the thinly veiled portrayals including [[Jens Albinus]] as director [[Nils Malmros]], [[Dejan Čukić]] as screenwriter [[Mogens Rukov]] and [[Søren Pilmark]] in an especially unflattering portrayal as sex-obsessed school principal [[Henning Camre]].

Von Trier's next feature film was ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'', an [[art film]] about "a grieving couple who retreat to their cabin in the woods, hoping a return to Eden will repair their broken hearts and troubled marriage; but nature takes its course and things go from bad to worse". The film, which includes sexually explicit content, stars [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]. It premiered in competition at the 2009 [[Cannes Film Festival]], where the festival's jury honoured the movie by giving the Best Actress award to Gainsbourg.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0525/1224247325203.html?digest=1 |title=Cannes jury gives its heart to works of graphic darkness |work=The Irish Times  |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0525/1224247325203.html?digest=1 |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref> The Cannes Film Festival [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury|Ecumenical Jury]], which gives prizes for movies that promote spiritual, humanist and universal values, also "honoured" the film with a special "anti-award"; a spokesman for the jury described it as "the most misogynist movie from the self-proclaimed biggest director in the world."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cannes-or-bust.com/2009/05/lars-von-triers-antichrist-gets-anti-award/ |title=Lars Von Trier's Antichrist gets anti-award at Cannes |work=Cannes or Bust |location=France |accessdate=29 April 2015}} </ref> In 2010 the Swedish newspaper ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' reported on their website that the film production company Zentropa is reportedly making more revenue from suing movie pirates in Germany that have downloaded ''Antichrist'' illegally than from box office and DVD sales, demanding a payment of around 1,300 euros per download to avoid legal action.<ref>{{cite web|author=DN |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/11000-kronor-for-en-filmbiljett |title=11.000 kronor för en filmbiljett |publisher=DN.SE |date=29 December 2010 |accessdate=6 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120731/http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/film-tv/11000-kronor-for-en-filmbiljett |archivedate=31 July 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

And after a while you find you don't even react to the explicit scenes. They become as natural as seeing someone eating a bowl of cereal." Von Trier refused to attend the private screening due to the negative response that he received to Nazi-related remarks at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, which led to his expulsion from the festival. In the director's defense, Skarsgård stated at the screening, "Everyone knows he's not a Nazi, and it was disgraceful the way the press had these headlines saying he was."<ref name="porn">{{cite news|title=Lars Von Trier's Nymphomaniac arouses debate as a 'really bad porn movie'|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/dec/05/lars-von-trier-nymphomaniac-stellan-skarsgard?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2&commentpage=1|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 December 2013|author=Xan Brooks}}</ref>

For its public release in the UK, the four-hour version of ''Nymphomaniac'' was divided into two volumes—''Volume I'' and ''Volume II''—and the film's UK premiere was on 22 February 2014. In interviews prior to the UK release date, Gainsbourg and co-star Stacy Martin revealed that [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] vaginas, body doubles, and special effects were used for the production of the film. Martin also stated that the film's characters are a reflection of the director himself and referred to the experience as an "honour" that she enjoyed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nymphomaniac star Charlotte Gainsbourg: 'The sex wasn't hard.

The film was also released in two volumes for the Australian release on 20 March 2014, with an interval separating the back-to-back sections. In his review of the film for [[3RRR]] film criticism program, "Plato's Cave", presenter Josh Nelson stated that, since the production of ''Breaking the Waves'', the filmmaker that Von Trier is most akin to is [[Alfred Hitchcock]], due to his portrayal of feminine issues. Nelson also mentioned filmmaker [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] as another influence, who Von Trier himself has also cited.<ref name="Cave">{{cite web|title=Broadcast on Monday, March 31st, 2014, 7:00 PM|url=http://www.rrr.org.au/program/plato-s-cave/|work=Plato's Cave|publisher=3RRR|accessdate=16 April 2014|author=Thomas Caldwell and Josh Nelson|format=Podcast|date=31 March 2014}}</ref>

==Style and creative methods==
=== Explicit images ===

Von Trier's use of sexually explicit images in ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998) started a wave{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} of arthouse [[Unsimulated sex in film|mainstream films with unsimulated sex]], such as [[Catherine Breillat]]'s ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'' (1999), ''[[Baise-Moi]]'' (2000), ''[[Intimacy (film)|Intimacy]]'' (2001), [[Vincent Gallo]]'s ''[[The Brown Bunny]]'' (2003) and [[Michael Winterbottom]]'s ''[[9 Songs (film)|9 songs]]'' (2004).

In 1998, Lars von Trier also made history by having his company [[Zentropa]] be the world's first mainstream film company to produce [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] [[pornographic film]]s. Three of these films, ''[[Constance (1998 film)|Constance]]'' (1998), ''[[Pink Prison]]'' (1999) and the adult/mainstream crossover-feature ''[[All About Anna]]'' (2005), were made primarily for a female audience, and were extremely successful in Europe, with the first two being directly responsible for the March 2006 legalising of pornography in [[Norway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medietilsynet.no/Documents/Aktuelt/Presedenssaker/Filmklagenemd/2006-0698-04_Flirtshop_Klagenemnda.pdf |title=Norwegian Media Authority none-censorship decision |format=PDF |accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref>

=== Filming techniques ===

Lars von Trier has said that "a film should be like a stone in your shoe". To create original art he feels that filmmakers must distinguish themselves stylistically from other films, often by placing restrictions on the filmmaking process. The most famous restriction is the cinematic "vow of chastity" of the [[Dogme95]] movement with which he is associated, though only one of his films, ''[[The Idiots]]'', is an actual Dogme 95 film. In ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]'', jump shots<ref>{{cite book

Von Trier often shoots [[Digital cinematography|digitally]] and operates the camera himself, preferring to continuously shoot the actors in-character without stopping between takes. In ''Dogville'' he let actors stay in character for hours, in the style of [[method acting]]. These techniques often put great strain on actors, most famously with [[Björk]] during the filming of ''Dancer in the Dark''. Often he uses the same regular group of actors in many of his films: some of his frequently used actors are [[Jean-Marc Barr]], [[Udo Kier]] and [[Stellan Skarsgård]].

He is heavily influenced by the work of [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]]<ref>{{cite book

=== Trilogies ===

Von Trier has on occasion referred to his films as falling into thematic and stylistic [[trilogy|trilogies]]. This pattern began with his first feature film, marking the beginning of The ''[[Europa trilogy]]'', though he claims a trilogy was not initially planned, instead being applied to the films in retrospect. The Europe trilogy illuminated the traumas of Europe in the past and future. This trilogy includes ''[[The Element of Crime]]'' (1984), ''[[Epidemic (film)|Epidemic]]'' (1987) and ''[[Europa (film)|Europa]]'' (1991).

The ''Golden Heart'' trilogy was about naive heroines who maintain their 'golden hearts' despite the tragedies they experience. This trilogy consists of ''[[Breaking the Waves]]'' (1996), ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998) and ''[[Dancer in the Dark]]'' (2000).<ref>http://www.andsoitbeginsfilms.com/2013/06/top-10-unconventional-trilogies.html</ref> While all three films are sometimes associated with the [[Dogme 95]] movement, only ''The Idiots'' is a certified Dogme 95 film.

The ''USA: Land of Opportunities'' trilogy follows the character of Grace, and is set in a stylised American past. Von Trier has stated he was inspired to make a trilogy about the United States as a reaction to Americans at the Cannes film festival who said he had no right to make the ''Dancer in the Dark'',<ref name="tomb"/> which was often viewed as being critical of a country he has never been to (and has no intention of ever visiting, due to his phobia of travel); however, von Trier himself has stated in interviews he did not intend it to be a criticism of America, saying the film takes place in a "fictional America". Von Trier proposed the films as ‘a series of sermons on America’s sins and hypocrisy’{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, inspired by the fact that American movie makers have made many movies about places across the world to which they have not travelled. All three movies will be shot in the same distinctive style, on a bare [[sound stage]] with no set and buildings marked by lines on the floor. This style is inspired by 1970s televised theatre. The trilogy will consist of ''[[Dogville]]'' (2003), ''[[Manderlay]]'' (2005) and the so far not produced ''[[Wasington]]''.

The ''Depression'' Trilogy consists of ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'', ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' and ''[[Nymphomaniac (film)|Nymphomaniac]]''. All three star [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] and deal with characters who suffer depression or grief in different ways. This trilogy is said to represent the depression that von Trier himself experiences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/03/20/nyphomaniac-volumes-i-and-ii-reviewed-lars-von-triers-sexually-graphic-pairing-will-titillate-but-fails-to-satisfy/|title=''Nyphomaniac'', ''Volumes I'' and ''II'', reviewed: Lars von Trier’s sexually graphic pairing will titillate, but fails to satisfy|last=Knight|first=Chris|date=20 March 2014|publisher=''[[National Post]]''|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>

''[[The Kingdom (TV miniseries)|The Kingdom]]'' (''Riget'') was planned as a trilogy of three seasons with 13 episodes in total, but the third season was not filmed due to death of star [[Ernst-Hugo Järegård]] shortly after completion of the second season.

Referring to the art of Nazi architect [[Albert Speer]], von Trier added: " ... he had some talent that was kind of possible for him to use during ... Ok, I'm a Nazi." Then, to ''[[Toronto Star]]'' film critic Peter Howell, who questioned whether ''Melancholia'' could be an answer to Hollywood blockbusters and asked von Trier if he could "envision doing a film on a grander scale than this", von Trier replied: "On a grander scale? Yeah. Yeah that's what we Nazis, we have a tendency to try to do things on a greater scale. Yeah, maybe you could persuade me into the final solution with journalists."

Hours later, von Trier released a brief statement of apology about his comments at the press conference: "If I have hurt someone this morning by the words I said at the press conference, I sincerely apologise. I am not anti-semitic or racially prejudiced in any way, nor am I a Nazi."<ref name="Hoyle">{{cite news | title=Von Trier gets kicked out of Cannes after his 'I am a Nazi' joke fails to raise a laugh |work=The Times  | date=20 May 2011 | author=Hoyle, Ben | location=London | page=9}}</ref> The next day, the festival directors held an extraordinary meeting, deciding his remarks were "unacceptable, intolerable and contrary to the ideals of humanity and generosity that preside over the very existence of the festival. [...] The board of directors condemns these comments and declares Lars von Trier persona non-grata at the Festival de Cannes, with effect immediately."<ref name="Hoyle" />

Afterwards, von Trier held a news conference of his own in Danish. His first remark to the Danish journalists was: "If any of you journalists will beat me, so just do it. I will enjoy it." He went on to say that "The Holocaust is the worst crime that ever happened. I have nothing against Jews. I have a Jewish name, and all my children have Jewish names." He admitted that his remarks about the Nazis had been misguided, saying "It was really stupidly done and it was in the wrong forum. At the press conference with Danish journalists, there were no problems, but I do not think the international journalists understand my Danish humor." But he also said he was proud to have been kicked out of the Cannes festival: "I am proud to have been declared 'persona non grata'. It is perhaps the first time in cinematic history, it has happened. ... I think one reason is that French people treated the Jews badly during World War II. Therefore, it is a sensitive topic for them.

Speaking to other news outlets he said that his comments were "very sarcastic and very rude, but that's very Danish."

In the October 2011 issue of ''[[GQ]]'', von Trier is quoted in an interview saying he was not really sorry for the comments he made, only sorry he didn't make it clear that he was joking. He added, "I can't be sorry for what I said—it's against my nature."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gq.com/entertainment/movies-and-tv/201110/lars-von-trier-gq-interview-october-2011 |date=October 2011 |last=Heath |first=Chris |title=Lars Attacks! |newspaper=[[GQ]] |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120920/http://www.gq.com/entertainment/movies-and-tv/201110/lars-von-trier-gq-interview-october-2011 |archivedate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref> On 5 October 2011, von Trier was interviewed by police in Denmark about his remarks at Cannes. Afterwards, he announced that he had 'decided from this day forth to refrain from all public statements and interviews'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2011/10/lars-von-trier-seals-his-lips-after-police-inquiry.html |title=Lars von Trier seals his lips after police inquiry |publisher=Artsjournal.com |accessdate=6 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120721/http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2011/10/lars-von-trier-seals-his-lips-after-police-inquiry.html |archivedate=21 July 2012 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

In keeping with his announcement in October 2011, Von Trier did not attend a private press screening of his 2013 film ''[[Nymphomaniac (film)|Nymphomaniac]]''. Skarsgård stated in December 2013, following a Copenhagen screening of the film, "The explosions in Cannes had nothing to do with Lars ... and that's why he doesn't want to talk, because he feels insecure. He feels that whatever he says can be turned into something outrageous."<ref name="porn" /> At the screening of ''Nymphomaniac'' at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 2014, Von Trier attended a photocall wearing a T-shirt that had the words "Persona non grata" and the golden leaf logo of the Cannes Film Festival.<ref>{{cite news|title=Actor Shia LaBeouf walks out of Berlin press conference |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26109348 |work=BBC News |accessdate=9 February 2014|date=9 February 2014}}</ref>

<blockquote>Until that point I thought I had a Jewish background. But I'm really more of a Nazi. I believe that my biological father's German family went back two further generations. Before she died, my mother told me to be happy that I was the son of this other man. She said my foster father had had no goals and no strength. But he was a loving man. And I was very sad about this revelation. And you then feel manipulated when you really do turn out to be creative. If I'd known that my mother had this plan, I would have become something else. I would have shown her.

=== Mental health ===

Von Trier suffers from multiple phobias, including an intense [[fear of flying]].<ref>{{cite book

|page=114}}</ref> His fear of air travel frequently places severely limiting constraints on him and his crew, necessitating that virtually all of his films be shot in either Denmark or [[Sweden]], even those set in the United States or other foreign countries. Von Trier has had a number of his films featured at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] over the course of his career, and each time has insisted on driving from Denmark to France for the festival and back.

On numerous occasions von Trier has also stated that he suffers from occasional depression which renders him incapable of performing his work and unable to fulfill social obligations.<ref>{{cite book
