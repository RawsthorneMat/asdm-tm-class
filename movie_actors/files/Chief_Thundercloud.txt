'''Chief Thundercloud''', (born '''Victor Daniels''', April 12, 1899 &ndash; December 1, 1955) was an American [[character actor]] in [[Western (genre)|Westerns]].

Information about Thundercloud is vague.  Most biographies state that he was a full blooded [[Cherokee]] (or [[Creek people|Muskogee]]), although others state that he had some German, Scottish and/or Irish ancestors; and that he was educated at the [[University of Arizona]], although no record exists of his enrollment.<ref name="bwesterns">[http://www.b-westerns.com/chief1.htm B-Westerns], retrieved 11 August 2007</ref>  The pressbook for ''[[The Lone Ranger Rides Again]]'' announced his parents as "Dark Cloud and Morning Star, aristocrats of the Muskogee tribe"<ref>''The Lone Ranger Rides Again'' pressbook, via [http://www.b-westerns.com/chief1.htm B-Westerns], retrieved 11 August 2007</ref> but his death certificate lists his father as "Joseph Mahawa."<ref name="bwesterns" />  

Daniels worked many jobs before becoming a stuntman.  From there he graduated to [[character actor]] status. His title "Chief" was a Hollywood invention.  He had the title role in ''Geronimo'' ([[1939 in film|1939]]) and played [[Tonto]] in both [[Republic Pictures|Republic]] Lone Ranger serials, ''[[The Lone Ranger (serial)|The Lone Ranger]]'' ([[1938 in film|1938]]) and ''The Lone Ranger Rides Again'' ([[1939 in film|1939]]).

In later years, he worked with other western actors, performing in live shows at the [[Corriganville Movie Ranch]], now the Corriganville Regional Park near [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[California]]. One of his last appearances was on March 1, 1955, as the [[Apache people|Apache]] [[Geronimo]] in the premiere episode of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[television series]] ''[[Buffalo Bill, Jr.]]'', starring [[Dick Jones (actor)|Dick Jones]] in the fictional title role of a young [[Texas]] frontier marshal.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), p. 114</ref>

==As a character actor==
After working for some time as a stuntman, Thundercloud took on the classical character role of Tonto in the 1938 serial "The Lone Ranger". This is perhaps where Thundercloud gained recognition as an official character actor."<ref name="bwesterns" />  The same year he had a small villain-like role in the first part of "Flaming Frontiers", a 15 part cliff hanger about murder and double cross. The following year Thundercloud reprised his role as the Lone Rangerâ€™s side kick in the "Lone Ranger Rides Again".  

Throughout the 1940s Chief Thundercloud continued to work as a character actor. In most of the films in which he was featured, he played an antagonist opposing the white protagonist. For example, in the 1940 film "Young Buffalo Bill" he played Akuna, a renegade Native American chief who commits murder while working as a hired hand. In 1946 he played the main villain in the western film ''[[Renegade Girl]]'', playing Chief Whitecloud, a vengeful antagonist.

Although featured in a number of films, Chief Thundercloud went uncredited in some films, such as ''[[Gun Smoke]]'' (1935), a film about a ranch defending itself from a flood of sheep. He also appeared in the first two parts of the serial ''[[Custer's Last Stand]]'' (1936), again he went uncredited.
