===2003–05: Career downturn and tabloid notoriety ===
In 2003, Affleck was the subject of much tabloid media attention due to his relationship with Jennifer Lopez. The actor himself remarked that the increased media attention filled him with a sense of "dread ... People are going to grow weary of this."<ref name="moviehole.net"/> By the end of the year, Affleck had become, in the words of ''GQ'', the "world's most over-exposed actor."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gq.com/entertainment/movies-and-tv/201304/verge-letter-ben-affleck-april-2004?changecurrentdate=true&date=2013/04/11&save_in_session=true |title=The Verge: Building a New Ben |publisher=Gq.com |date=2014-01-04 |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref> His newfound tabloid notoriety coincided with a series of poorly received films.

The first of these films was ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]'' (2003), in which Affleck starred as the [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|blind superhero]].  Years earlier, he had written a foreword for a comic book about his childhood love for ''Daredevil''.<ref name="moviehole.net">{{cite web|last= |first= |url=http://moviehole.net/20031411interview-ben-affleck-daredevil |title=Interview : Ben Affleck – Daredevil – Moviehole |publisher=Moviehole.net |accessdate=2014-06-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Ryan J.|last=Downey|date=June 24, 2002|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1455368/20020621/story.jhtml|title=Affleck, Garner Open Up About 'Daredevil'|publisher=MTV|accessdate=April 27, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Gunn|date=June 20, 2002|url=http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=620|title=Daredevil Press Day!!|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|accessdate=April 27, 2009}}</ref> The movie received a mixed response from both critics and audiences, the latter of whom were far more negative towards Affleck's performance in the film. Elvis Mitchell of the ''New York Times'' felt Affleck was "lost" in the role: "A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role ...

Affleck's poor critical notices continued in 2004. He starred in the romantic comedy ''[[Jersey Girl (2004 film)|Jersey Girl]]'', directed by longtime collaborator Smith.
