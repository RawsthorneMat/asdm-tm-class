'''Lee Marvin''' (February 19, 1924&nbsp;– August 29, 1987) was an American film and television actor.<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', September 2, 1987.</ref> Known for his distinctive voice, white hair and {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}}<ref>[http://www.celebheights.com/s/Lee-Marvin-1011.html "Lee Marvin height: 6 ft 2 in (188 cm)."] ''celebheights.com.''

From 1957 to 1960, he starred as Detective Lieutenant Frank Ballinger in the [[NBC]] hit crime series, ''[[M Squad]]''.

In 1966 he won several awards, including an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|Best Actor BAFTA]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor&nbsp;– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor Golden Globe]], for his dual roles in ''[[Cat Ballou]]''.

==Early life==
Marvin was born in [[New York City]]. He was the son of Lamont Waltman Marvin, an advertising executive and the head of the New York and New England Apple Institute, and his wife Courtenay Washington (née Davidge), a fashion writer and beauty consultant.<ref name="roots">[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/marvin.htm "Lee Marvin's ancestors."] ''freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com''. Retrieved: October 11, 2013.</ref> As with his older brother, Robert, he was named in honor of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[Robert E. Lee]], who was his first cousin, four times removed.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  His father was a direct descendant of Matthew Marvin, Sr., who emigrated from [[Great Bentley]], [[Essex]], [[England]] in 1635 and helped found [[Hartford, Connecticut]].<ref name="roots"/>

Marvin studied [[violin]] when he was young.<ref name="esquire"/>  As a teenager, Marvin "spent weekends and spare time hunting [[White-tailed deer|deer]], [[Florida panther|puma]], [[wild turkey]] and [[Bobwhite Quail|bobwhite]] in the wilds of the then-uncharted [[Everglades]]."<ref name="hunting">[http://culturepulp.typepad.com/culturepulp/2008/08/elk-huntingwith-lee-marvin.html "Elk Hunting with Lee Marvin."] ''Gun World'',  May 1964; retrieved October 11, 2013.</ref>

He attended Manumit School, a Christian socialist boarding school in [[Pawling (town), New York|Pawling, New York]], during the late 1930s, and later attended [[St. Leo University|St. Leo College Preparatory School]] in [[St. Leo, Florida]] after being [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] from several other schools for bad behavior.<ref>Zec 1980, pp. 20–25.</ref>

==Military service==
In August 1942 Marvin left school to enlist in the [[United States Marine Corps]], serving with the [[4th Marine Division (United States)|4th Marine Division]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]].<ref>Wise and Rehill 1999, [http://books.google.com/books?id=l3Z78rt_oHsC p. 43.]</ref> He was wounded in action during the [[Battle of Saipan]], in the assault on [[Mount Tapochau]], during which most of his unit ("I" Company, [[24th Marine Regiment (United States)|24th Marines]], [[4th Marine Division]]) were killed.<ref>Zec 1980, p. 38.</ref> His injury was from [[machine gun]] fire, which severed his [[sciatic nerve]].<ref>[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=4&subID=1180 "The real thing: Marvin and Point Blank."] ''[[The First Post]]'', February 15, 2007; retrieved October 11, 2013.</ref> Marvin was awarded the [[Purple Heart]] and was given a medical discharge with the rank of [[Private First Class#United States|Private First Class]] in 1945 at Philadelphia.<ref name="snopes">[http://www.snopes.com/military/marvin.asp "Captain Kangaroo Court"], ''[[Snopes]]'', May 24, 2009; retrieved October 11, 2013.</ref>  Marvin's awards were the Purple Heart, the Presidential Unit Citation, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal. Contrary to rumors, Marvin did not serve with producer and actor [[Bob Keeshan]] (later best known as [[Captain Kangaroo]]) during World War II.<ref name="snopes"/>

==Career==
After the war, while working as a [[plumber]]'s assistant at a local community theatre in [[Upstate New York]], Marvin was asked to replace an actor who had fallen ill during rehearsals. He then began an amateur [[off-Broadway]] acting career in New York City and eventually made it to Broadway with a small role in the original production of Billy Budd.<ref>Epstein 2013, p. 67.</ref>

In 1950, Marvin moved to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. He found work in supporting roles, and from the beginning was cast in various war films. As a decorated combat veteran, Marvin was a natural in war dramas, where he frequently assisted the director and other actors in realistically portraying [[infantry]] movement, arranging costumes, and the use of firearms. His debut was in ''[[You're in the Navy Now]]'' (1951), and in 1952 he appeared in several films, including [[Don Siegel]]'s ''Duel at Silver Creek'', ''Hangman's Knot'', and the war drama ''[[Eight Iron Men]]''. He played [[Gloria Grahame]]'s vicious boyfriend in [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[The Big Heat]]'' (1953). Marvin had a small but memorable role in ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953) opposite [[Marlon Brando]] (Marvin's gang in the film was called "The Beetles"), followed by ''Seminole'' (1953) and ''[[Gun Fury]]'' (1953). He also had a notable small role as smart-aleck sailor Meatball in ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]''. He had a substantially more important part as Hector, the small-town hood in ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' (1955) with [[Spencer Tracy]].<ref>Epstein 2013, pp. 95–96.</ref> Also in 1955, he played the interesting role of a somewhat lovelorn and touching (though thoroughly no-good) bank-robber in [[Violent Saturday]]. 

During the mid-1950s, Marvin gradually began playing more important roles. He starred in ''[[Attack (1956 film)|Attack]]'', (1956) and had a  supporting role in the [[Western (genre)|Western]] ''[[Seven Men from Now]]'' (1956). He also starred in ''[[The Missouri Traveler]]'' (1958) but it took over 100 episodes as [[Chicago]] cop Frank Ballinger in the successful 1957–1960 television series ''[[M Squad]]'' to actually give him name recognition.<ref>Epstein 2013, p. 112.</ref>

One critic described the show as "a hyped-up, violent ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''...&nbsp;with a hard-as-nails Marvin" playing a tough police lieutenant. Marvin received the role after guest-starring in a memorable ''Dragnet'' episode as a [[serial killer]].<ref>Epstein 2013, p. 79.</ref> 
[[File:Aldrich Attack movie trailer screenshot2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Marvin in ''[[Attack (film)|Attack]]'']]
In the 1960s, Marvin was given prominent supporting roles in such films as ''[[The Comancheros (film)|The Comancheros]]'' (1961), [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962), and ''[[Donovan's Reef]]'' (1963), all starring [[John Wayne]], with Marvin's roles getting larger with each film. As the vicious Liberty Valance, Marvin played his first title role and held his own with two of the screen's biggest stars (Wayne and [[James Stewart]]).<ref>Epstein 2013, p. 124.</ref>

For director [[Don Siegel]], Marvin appeared in ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'' (1964) playing an efficient professional assassin alongside [[Clu Gulager]]. ''The Killers'' was also the first film in which Marvin received top billing.<ref name="Epstein 2013, p. 135">Epstein 2013, p. 135.</ref>

Playing alongside [[Vivien Leigh]] and [[Simone Signoret]], Marvin won the 1966 [[National Board of Review of Motion Pictures|National Board of Review]] Award for male actors for his role in ''[[Ship of Fools (film)|Ship of Fools]]'' (1965).<ref name= "Awards">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059712/awards?ref_=tt_ql_4 "Awards: Ship of Fools (1965)."] ''IMDb.''

Marvin won the 1965 [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his comic role in the offbeat Western ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' starring [[Jane Fonda]]. He also won the 1965 [[Silver Bear for Best Actor]] at the [[15th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="berlinale 1965">[http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1965/03_preistr_ger_1965/03_Preistraeger_1965.html "Berlinale 1965: Prize Winners".] ''Internationale Filmfestspiele Berlin''. Retrieved: October 11, 2013.</ref>

[[File:Lee Marvin 1959.JPG|thumb|150px|Marvin in 1959 from the set of [[M Squad]]]]
Marvin next performed in the hit Western ''[[The Professionals (1966 film)|The Professionals]]'' (1966), in which he played the leader of a small band of skilled mercenaries ([[Burt Lancaster]], [[Robert Ryan]], and [[Woody Strode]]) rescuing a kidnap victim ([[Claudia Cardinale]]) shortly after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. He followed that film with the hugely successful World War II epic ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967) in which top-billed Marvin again portrayed an intrepid commander of a colorful group (future stars [[John Cassavetes]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Telly Savalas]], [[Jim Brown]], and [[Donald Sutherland]]) performing an almost impossible mission. In the wake of these two films and after having received an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]], Marvin was a huge star, given enormous control over his next film ''[[Point Blank (1967 film)|Point Blank]]''.

In ''Point Blank'', an influential film for director [[John Boorman]], he portrayed a hard-nosed criminal bent on revenge. Marvin, who had selected Boorman himself for the director's slot, had a central role in the film's development, plot line, and staging. In 1968, Marvin also appeared in another Boorman film, the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful World War II character study ''[[Hell in the Pacific]]'', also starring famed Japanese actor [[Toshiro Mifune]]. Marvin was originally cast as Pike Bishop (later played by [[William Holden]]) in ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), but fell out with director [[Sam Peckinpah]] and pulled out in order to star in the Western musical ''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1969), in which he was top-billed over a singing [[Clint Eastwood]]. Despite his limited singing ability, he had a hit song with "[[Wand'rin' Star]]". By this time he was getting paid a million dollars per film, $200,000 less than top star [[Paul Newman]] was making at the time; yet he was ambivalent about the film business, even with its financial rewards:<ref name="esquire">[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]]. [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19701010/PEOPLE/41115001/1023 "An interview with Lee Marvin."] ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'',  October 1970.</ref>

:"You spend the first forty years of your life trying to get in this business, and the next forty years trying to get out. And then when you're making the bread, who needs it?"

Marvin had a much greater variety of roles in the 1970s and 1980s, with fewer 'bad-guy' roles than in earlier years. His 1970s films included ''[[Monte Walsh (1970)|Monte Walsh]]'' (1970) with [[Jeanne Moreau]], the violent ''[[Prime Cut]]'' (1972) with [[Gene Hackman]], ''[[Pocket Money]]'' (1972) with [[Paul Newman]], ''[[Emperor of the North Pole]]'' (1973) opposite [[Ernest Borgnine]], as Hickey in ''[[The Iceman Cometh (1973 film)|The Iceman Cometh]]'' (1973) with [[Fredric March]] and [[Robert Ryan]], ''[[The Spikes Gang]]'' (1974) with [[Noah Beery, Jr.]], ''[[The Klansman]]'' (1974) with [[Richard Burton]], ''[[Shout at the Devil (film)|Shout at the Devil]]'' (1976) with [[Roger Moore]], ''[[The Great Scout and Cathouse Thursday]]'' (1976) with [[Oliver Reed]], and ''[[Avalanche Express]]'' (1978) with [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]. Marvin was offered the [[Quint (Jaws character)|role of Quint]] in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975) but declined, stating "What would I tell my fishing friends who'd see me come off a hero against a dummy shark?".<ref>Zec 1980, p. 217.</ref>

Marvin's last big role was in [[Samuel Fuller]]'s ''[[The Big Red One]]'' (1980), a [[war film]] based on Fuller's own war experiences. His remaining films were ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]], ''[[Gorky Park (film)|Gorky Park]]'' (1983), ''[[Dog Day (1984 film)|Dog Day]]'' (1984), and ''[[The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission]]'' (1985; a sequel with Marvin, [[Ernest Borgnine]], and [[Richard Jaeckel]] picking up where they'd left off despite being 18 years older); his final appearance was in ''[[The Delta Force]]'' (1986) with [[Chuck Norris]].<ref>Epstein 2013, p. 202.</ref>

==Personal life==
During the 1970s, Marvin resided off and on in Woodstock, caring for his dying father,<ref>Flick, A.J. [http://www.classicmovies.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&Itemid=4&id=3341 "Marvin in Love".] ''Classic Movies'', 1997.

Retrieved: October 11, 2013.</ref> In 1975 Marvin and his second wife Pamela moved to [[Tucson, Arizona]], where he lived until his death.

Marvin was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who opposed the [[Vietnam War]]. He publicly endorsed [[John F. Kennedy]] in the 1960 presidential election.<ref name="Epstein 2013, p. 135"/>

===Marriages and children===
A father of four, Marvin was married twice. His first marriage to Betty Ebeling began in February 1951 and ended in divorce on January 5, 1967; during this time his hobbies included sport fishing off the [[Baja California peninsula|Baja California coast]] and [[Waterfowl hunting|duck hunting]] along the Mexican border near [[Mexicali]].<ref name="hunting"/> He and Ebeling had a son, Christopher (1952–2013),<ref>[http://www.independent.com/obits/2013/oct/23/christopher-marvin/ "Obituary Christopher Marvin"]</ref> and three daughters: Courtenay (b. 1954), Cynthia (b. 1956) and Claudia (1958-2012).<ref>Epstein 2013, p. 256.</ref><ref>[http://www.allstatescremation.info/obit.aspx?obitID=3246&BLT=44ec5ef0-453c-4767-9eaa-6f948827704f "Obituary: Claudia Leslie Marvin"], ''All-States Cremation''; retrieved: October 11, 2013.</ref>

===Community property case===
:''See also [[Palimony#Marvin v. Marvin|Marvin v. Marvin]]''
In 1971, Marvin was sued by [[Michelle Triola]], his [[cohabitation|live-in]] girlfriend from 1965 to 1970, who legally changed her surname to "Marvin".<ref name="esquire"/> Although the couple never married, she sought financial compensation similar to that available to spouses under California's [[alimony]] and [[community property]] laws. Triola claimed Marvin made her pregnant three times and paid for two abortions, while one pregnancy ended in miscarriage.<ref name="obit">Woo, Elaine.

Retrieved: October 11, 2013.</ref> In 1979, Marvin was ordered to pay $104,000 to Triola for "rehabilitation purposes" but the court denied her community property claim for one-half of the $3.6 million which Marvin had earned during their six years of [[cohabitation]]&nbsp;– distinguishing non-marital relationship contracts from marriage, with community property rights only attaching to the latter by operation of law. Rights equivalent to community property only apply in non-marital relationship contracts when the parties expressly, whether orally or in writing, contract for such rights to operate between them. After the case, Marvin was the subject of controversy when he said that the trial was a "circus" and that "everyone was lying, even I lied." {{citation needed|reason=no source|date=April 2015}}

In August 1981, the [[California Court of Appeal]] found there was no such contract, and thus nullified the award she had received.<ref>Laskin, Jerry.

==Death==
In December 1986, Marvin underwent intestinal surgery after suffering abdominal pains while at his ranch outside [[Tucson]]. Doctors said then that there was an inflammation of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], but that no [[malignancy]] was found. After being hospitalized for more than two weeks because of "a run-down condition related to the flu," Marvin died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on August 29, 1987.<ref>Hevesi, Dennis.
