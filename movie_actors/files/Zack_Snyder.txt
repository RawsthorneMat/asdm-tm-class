'''Zachary Edward''' "'''Zack'''" '''Snyder''' (born March 1, 1966) is an American film director, film producer, and screenwriter, best known for action and science fiction films. Snyder made his feature film debut with the 2004 remake of the horror film ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', which earned a good box office return and positive reviews from critics. He has gone on to be known for his [[comic book movies]] and superhero films, including ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2007) and ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009), as well as the Superman film that started the [[DC Comics' shared universe films]]: ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013) and its upcoming follow-ups, ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Justice League Part One]]'' (2017) and ''[[Justice League Part Two]]'' (2019).

Snyder is the co-founder of [[Cruel and Unusual Films]], a production company he established in 2004, alongside his wife [[Deborah Snyder]] and producing partner Wesley Coller.

==Early life==
Snyder was born in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] and raised in [[Riverside, Connecticut]]. His mother, Marsha (née Reeves), was a painter and a photography teacher at [[Daycroft School]], which Snyder later attended. His father, Charles Edward "Ed" Snyder, worked as an executive recruiter.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBEB&p_theme=pbeb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=117C5D13549DA238&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | work=Berkshire Eagle, The | title=Fan makes a film | date=March 8, 2007}}</ref><ref>http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/berkshire/obituary.aspx?n=marsha-snyder&pid=144455179</ref> He was raised as a [[Christian Scientist]].<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/fashion/weddings/20UNIONS.html?pagewanted=all</ref> Snyder attended Camp Owatonna in Harrison, Maine, during the summer months as a child. Snyder's mother inspired him to study paintings a year after high school at [[Heatherley School of Fine Art]] in England, although he had already begun filmmaking. Afterward, Snyder attended the [[Art Center College of Design]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California (where he was classmates with [[Michael Bay]]).

==Career==
[[File:Zack Snyder by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|Snyder at the 2013 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]
Snyder went on to shoot, as a director and as a [[cinematographer]], television commercials for such clients as the automobile companies [[Audi]], [[BMW]], [[Subaru]] and [[Nissan]], among others. Other commercial work has been for clients including [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Reebok]], and [[Gatorade]].

Snyder made his feature film debut with the remake of the horror film ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' (2004), and scored a box office hit with the fantasy war film ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2007), adapted from writer-artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s [[Dark Horse Comics]] [[miniseries]] of [[300 (comics)|the same name]]. His [[Warner Bros.]] film ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' was released on March&nbsp;6, 2009 and grossed $185 million worldwide. His follow-up project/animation debut titled ''[[Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole]]'' was released on September&nbsp;24, 2010. Snyder produced, co-wrote, and directed ''[[Sucker Punch (2011 film)|Sucker Punch]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Zack+Snyder%3A+Watchmen/|title = Zack Snyder: Watchmen|publisher = [[SuicideGirls.com]]|date = 5 March 2009|accessdate =March 5, 2009}}</ref> which was released on March&nbsp;25, 2011. The film, based on a script written by Snyder and Steve Shibuya, was about a young woman in a mental hospital who fantasizes of escape with her fellow inmates.

He directed 2013's ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' for Warner Bros., a reboot of the Superman franchise. He will direct a yet-to-be-produced remake of the 1969 film ''[[The Illustrated Man (film)|The Illustrated Man]]'', and produced the prequel/sequel to ''300'', ''[[300: Rise of an Empire]]'' (2014). He also wants to direct a segment for an upcoming ''[[Heavy Metal (film)#Remake|Heavy Metal 3]]'', and plans to write and direct a sequel to ''Legend of the Guardians''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/10/zack-snyder-directing-superman/ |title=SCOOP: Zack Snyder Directing 'Superman' |work=Deadline.com |author=Fleming, Mike |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=October 4, 2010}}</ref>

In October 2012, Warner Bros. announced a planned 2015 release for their ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' film. It remains unknown at this point whether or not [[Henry Cavill]] is expected to reprise his role. During an interview with the New York Post in November 2012, director Zack Snyder stated, “I don’t know how ‘Justice League’ is going to be handled. Honestly, I don’t. But ‘The Man of Steel’ exists, and Superman is in it. I don’t know how you’d move forward without acknowledging that,” and claimed that Warner Bros. expects him to "keep them on course" as regards to a potential cinematic universe. It was rumored in early March 2013 that Snyder would direct the ''Justice League'' film and that [[Christopher Nolan]] would again be producing.

In November 2012, Snyder proclaimed that he would not be involved with the development of ''Star Wars: Episode VII'' (''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''). Speculation swirled again in January 2013, when [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]] reported that he would be developing a ''Star Wars'' spin-off film inspired by ''[[Seven Samurai]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Zack-Snyder-to-direct-a-Star-Wars-movie/tabid/418/articleID/283104/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Zack Snyder to direct a Star Wars movie| date=January 14, 2013}}</ref> However, this report was later denied as rumor by Snyder's representative.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/01/star-wars-samurai-zack-snyder/|work= [[Wired News]] | title= Zack Snyder Denies Report of New Star Wars Film Based on Seven Samurai| date=January 14, 2013| first=Laura| last=Hudson}}</ref>
As of March 2013, it was rumored that Zack Snyder might be attached to the long in progress ''Justice League'' film. As reported by Latino Review, Snyder might either step in as a producer or he might direct the project itself. These reports have not been confirmed yet.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mayimbe |first=El |url=http://latino-review.com/2013/03/03/exclusive-dcu-takeover-huge-developments-justice-league/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: The DCU Takeover & HUGE Developments on ‘Justice League’ |publisher=Latino-Review.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref> Snyder is set to direct a ''Man of Steel'' sequel.<ref>{{cite web|author=NIKKI FINKE, Editor in Chief |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/06/man-of-steel-sequel-underway-with-zack-snyder-and-david-s-goyer/ |title=‘Man Of Steel’ Sequel Underway With Zack Snyder And David S.

==Style==
Snyder often uses [[slow motion]] in and out of the fight scenes in his films, which Amy Nicholson of ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]]'' magazine remarked separates the director from other filmmakers who make multiple cuts and close-ups during a fight. A minute-long shot from ''300'' shows King Leonidas walking down as he slaughters his enemies, and the camera only dollys in and out to emphasize each kill and move, though he has proven capable of directing a fast-paced combat scene, as shown first in ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'', and later on in ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=(Archived version) Back away from the zoom lens and AVID|date=February 26, 2009|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303045524/http://boxoffice.com/editors-desk/slow-and-steady.php|accessdate=February 28, 2009}}</ref>

==Awards==
Snyder's body of work has earned him a number of awards, including two [[Clio Award]]s and a Gold Lion Award for his [[Jeep]] "[[Frisbee]]" commercial. He also won an award for his humorous commercial "General's Party".

==Personal life==
Snyder lives in Pasadena with his second wife, producer [[Deborah Snyder]]. The couple first met in 1996, and married on September&nbsp;25, 2004 at the [[St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, New York|St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church]] in Manhattan, New York.<ref name="Weddings">{{cite news|title = WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS: VOWS; Deborah Johnson and Zack Snyder - New York Times|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E3DA1338F930A35753C1A9629C8B63&fta=y|date = October 3, 2004|last = Louie|first = Elaine|publisher = [[The New York Times Company]]|work = [[The New York Times]]|accessdate = 25 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/movies/e3i8f6bf92e292731581559af0969092ce9?pn=2|author=Frank Lovece|title=CGI: 'Watchmen'--Zack Snyder brings superhero saga to the finish line|journal=Film Journal International|date=2009-02-19|accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref>
