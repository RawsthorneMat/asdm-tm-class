'''John Daniel Singleton''' (born January 6, 1968) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer best known for directing ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' in 1991. For the film, he was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]], becoming the first African American and youngest person to have ever been nominated for the award. Singleton is a native of [[South Los Angeles]] and many of his early films, such as ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'' (1993), ''[[Higher Learning]]'' (1995), and ''[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]'' (2001), consider the implications of inner-city violence. Some of his other films include dramas such as ''[[Rosewood (film)|Rosewood]]'' (1997) in addition to action films such as ''[[Shaft (2000 film)|Shaft]]'' (2000), ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (2003), and ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]'' (2003).

==Early life==
Singleton was born in Los Angeles, the son of Sheila Ward-Johnson, a pharmaceutical company sales executive, and Danny Singleton, a real estate agent, mortgage broker, and financial planner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/89/John-Singleton.html |title=John Singleton Biography (1968–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}</ref> He attended [[Pasadena City College]] and the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]]. He graduated from USC in 1990, and is a member of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://cinema.usc.edu/alumni/pickford-award.htm USC Cinema – Alumni » Pickford Award]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> Singleton was enrolled in the [[University of Southern California]]'s Filmic Writing program under Margaret Mehring<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-cntv.usc.edu/about/news/margaret-mehring.htm |title=USC School of Cinematic Arts – About » News » Margaret Mehring |publisher=Cntv.usc.edu |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}</ref> and her now-famous curriculum.  The program was designed to take students directly into the Hollywood system as proficient writer/directors.

Unlike the other standard USC programs for screenwriting, film production, or the Peter Stark Motion Picture Producing and critical studies programs, Mehring designed her FILMIC writing program to teach a select group of students how to be authors of their visions.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}  Other students included Helen Childress (writer of ''[[Reality Bites]]''), [[Stephen Chbosky]] (writer of TV’s ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]''), and Ms. Childress’ husband Carlos Brooks (writer/director of ''[[Quid Pro Quo (film)|Quid Pro Quo]]''). Singleton was always present in the Apple computer writing lab, working on his screenplays during late nights and early mornings.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} However, his ability to direct was correlated to an early beginning in music videos, which culminated in the EFX driven  [[Michael Jackson]] “[[Remember the Time]]” MTV video. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Career==
Singleton's 1991 film debut ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'', an inner city drama starring [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]], [[Ice Cube]], and [[Laurence Fishburne]], was both a significant critical and commercial success. For his efforts, Singleton received Academy Award nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://cinema.usc.edu/alumni/pickford- award.htm USC Cinema – Alumni » Pickford Award]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> At age 24 <!--He received his nomination in 1992--> he was the youngest person ever nominated for Best Director, and the first African-American to be nominated for the award. The film has since attained classic status and, in 2002, the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film "culturally significant" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html|title=Films Selected to The National Film Registry, Library of Congress 1989–2008|accessdate=July 17, 2009|publisher=Loc}}</ref>

Singleton's follow-up films ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'' (1993) and ''[[Higher Learning]]'' (1995) were similarly socially conscious and received mixed to positive reviews. Singleton also directed the video for [[Michael Jackson]]'s 1991 single "[[Remember The Time]]", starring actor [[Eddie Murphy]].

In 1997, his film ''[[Rosewood (film)|Rosewood]]'', a historical drama about racial violence, was entered into the [[47th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1997/02_programm_1997/02_Programm_1997.html |title=Berlinale: 1997 Programme |accessdate=2012-01-12 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> Both this and his 2001 film ''[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]'' received very positive reviews and helped establish Singleton's critical reputation. Additionally, his adaptation of ''[[Shaft (2000 film)|Shaft]]'' (2000), starring [[Samuel L. Jackson]] in the title role, was successful critically and commercially.

Singleton has since turned to directing action films, such as ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (2003) and ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]'' (2005), which have for the most part received mixed to negative reviews.

In 2005, Singleton teamed with [[Craig Brewer]] and financed the [[independent film]], ''[[Hustle and Flow]]'', once it was clear that most other major backers would not clear it for release.

In 2013, it was announced that Singleton was attached as director of the [[Tupac Shakur|Tupac]] biography film. On April 3, 2015, Singleton reported that production was put on hold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/new-tupac-biopic-on-hold-says-director-john-singleton-20150403 |title=New Tupac Biopic 'On Hold,' Says Director John Singleton |author=Grow, Kory |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=April 3, 2015 |accessdate=April 4, 2015}}</ref> Four days later, it was announced that following creative differences with [[Morgan Creek Productions]], Singleton had stepped down as director, and was replaced by [[Carl Franklin]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thewrap.com/carl-franklin-to-replace-director-john-singleton-on-tupac-biopic/ | title=Carl Franklin to Replace Director John Singleton on Tupac Biopic | last=Donnelly | first=Matt | publisher=[[TheWrap]] | date=April 7, 2015 | accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>

==Personal life==
He has six children in total. 
John has a daughter named Justice Maya Singleton (born on October 17, 1992) with ex-companion Tosha Lewis, as well as a son, Maasai Mohandas Singleton (born April 3, 1994).

On October 12, 1996, John married Ghanaian actress [[Akosua Busia|Akosua Gyamama Busia]], who is the daughter of Ghana's second Prime Minister Dr. Kofi Abrefa Busia. They have a daughter named Hadar Singleton who was born on April 3, 1997—who has appeared in [[Tears of the sun|Tears of the Sun]] (2003) and other productions—and divorced in June 1997. John also has a daughter , Cleopatra Singleton who was born in 1999.

===Accident===
On August 23, 2007, Singleton was involved in an automobile accident in which he struck a [[jaywalking]] pedestrian, Constance Russell, 57, of Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,294534,00.html |title=Filmmaker John Singleton Involved in Fatal Car Accident in L.A. |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=August 25, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}</ref> Staying on the scene until police arrived, Singleton was not under the influence of alcohol or other substances, and was released after being questioned. Russell died later in the hospital. The case was turned over to the District Attorney but no charges were filed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/08/25/singleton/index.html |title=Movie director Singleton kills pedestrian in accident |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=August 25, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970897.html?categoryId=13&cs=1 |title=Singleton released after questioning – Entertainment News, Film News, Media |publisher=Variety |date=August 26, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2010}}</ref>

===Criticism of Hollywood===
On March 19, 2014, Singleton criticized popular studios for "refusing to let African-Americans direct black-themed films". Singleton told an audience of students at [[Loyola Marymount University]] "They ain't letting the black people tell the stories." He also added, "They want black people [to be] what they want them to be. And nobody is man enough to go and say that. They want black people to be who they want them to be, as opposed to what they are. The black films now — so-called black films now — they're great. They're great films. But they're just product. They're not moving the bar forward creatively. … When you try to make it homogenized, when you try to make it appeal to everybody, then you don't have anything that's special."<ref name="Appelo-black directors">{{cite news|last=Appelo|first=Tim|title=John Singleton Says Studios 'Ain't Letting Black People Tell Stories,' Unveils Tupac Biopic Plans|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-singleton-says-studios-aint-690486|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=Hollywood Reporter|date=24 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="Child- black director">{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=John Singleton accuses Hollywood of ignoring black directors|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/25/hollywood-ignores-black-directors-says-john-singleton|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="Rawden - Black director">{{cite news|last=Rawden|first=Mack|title=John Singleton Slams So-Called Studio Liberals For Not Offering More Opportunities|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/John-Singleton-Slams-So-Called-Studio-Liberals-Offering-More-Minorities-Opportunities-42237.html|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=Cinema Blend|date=24 March 2014}}</ref>
