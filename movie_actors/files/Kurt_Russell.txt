His first roles were as a child in television series, including a lead role in the [[Westerns on television|Western]] series ''[[The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (TV series)|The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters]]'' (1963–64). In the late 1960s, he signed a ten-year contract with [[The Walt Disney Company]], where, according to [[Robert Osborne]], he became the studio's top star of the 1970s.<ref name="Osbourne2007">Introduction by Robert Osborne to the [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] premiere of ''The Barefoot Executive'', April 13, 2007.</ref>

In 1984, for his performance in ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), Russell was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture. During the 1980s, he was cast in several films by director [[John Carpenter]], including [[anti-hero]] roles such as army hero-turned-robber [[Snake Plissken]] in the futuristic action film ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and its 1996 sequel ''[[Escape from L.A.]]'', Antarctic helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady in the horror film ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), and truck driver Jack Burton in the dark kung-fu comedy action film ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), all of which have since become [[cult film]]s. He was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for the television film ''[[Elvis (1979 film)|Elvis]]'' (1979), also directed by Carpenter.

In 1994, Russell had a starring role in the [[military science fiction]] film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''. In the mid-2000s, his portrayal of U.S. Olympic hockey coach [[Herb Brooks]] in ''[[Miracle (film)|Miracle]]'' (2004) won the praise of critics. In 2006, he appeared in the disaster-thriller ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]'' and in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Death Proof]]'', segment from the film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' in 2007.

Russell was born in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], the son of actor [[Bing Russell]] and dancer Louise Julia (Crone) Russell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/39/Kurt-Russell.html |title=Kirk Russell Film Reference bio |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref> In 1969, he graduated from [[Thousand Oaks High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twoop.com/people/kurt_russell.html |title=Kurt Russell Timeline and Biography}}</ref> His sister Jill is the mother of baseball player [[Matt Franco]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1026547/index.htm |title=SI Vault Sports Beat |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=September 2, 2002 |accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref>

== Career ==

=== 1957–1969 ===
Russell began his acting career in 1957 with an appearance as a child in the pilot of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[western (genre)|western]] television series ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' with [[Will Hutchins]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} His film career began at the age of eleven in an uncredited part in [[Elvis Presley]]'s ''[[It Happened at the World's Fair]]'',{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and two extra episodes, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the then defunct series ''Rin Tin Tin''. On April 24, 1963, Russell guest starred in the ABC series ''[[Our Man Higgins]]'', starring [[Stanley Holloway]] as an English butler in an American family. He played Peter Hall in the 1963 episode "Everybody Knows You Left Me" on the [[NBC]] [[medical drama]] about [[psychiatry]] ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]''.

Later in 1963, he landed the lead role as Jaimie in the ABC [[Western (genre)|Western]] series ''[[The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters (TV series)|The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters]]'' (1963–64). Based on a book by [[Robert Lewis Taylor]], the series starred [[Dan O'Herlihy]], John Maloney and the young [[Osmond Brothers]]. [[Charles Bronson]] became a semi-regular in the series. In 1964, he guest-starred in "Nemesis", an episode of the popular ABC series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' in which, as the son of police Lt. Phillip Gerard, he is unintentionally kidnapped by his father's quarry, Doctor [[Richard Kimble]]. That same year he appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' as a mistaken orphan whose father was an outlaw played by [[Rory Calhoun]] who was still alive and recently released from prison looking for his son. Russell played a similar role as a kid named Packy Kerlin in the 1964 episode "Blue Heaven" of the western series ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.  He also appeared in five episodes of ''[[Daniel Boone (TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' in various roles.

On February 6, 1965, Russell played the role of Jungle Boy on an episode of [[CBS]]'s ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''. He guest-starred on ABC's western ''[[The Legend of Jesse James (TV series)|The Legend of Jesse James]]''. In 1966, Russell played a 14-year-old Indian boy, Grey Smoke, adopted by the [[Texas Rangers Division|Texas Rangers]] in the episode "Meanwhile, Back at the Reservation" of the NBC western series ''[[Laredo (TV series)|Laredo]]''. In the story line, he works for an outlaw gang, but the Rangers take him under their wing and the boy proves helpful when gunslingers try to occupy [[Laredo, Texas]].<ref>Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), p. 115</ref>
 
In 1966, before Walt Disney died, the final words he ever wrote were “Kurt Russell.” No one knows why. Disney died soon after. Russell was a child actor whom the Disney studio had just signed to a long term contract.<ref>http://www.biography.com/news/walt-disney-biography-facts-video</ref> In January 1967, Russell co-starred as Private Willie Prentiss in the episode "Willie and the Yank: The Mosby Raiders" in ''[[Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]''. Later, he, [[Jay C. Flippen]] and [[Tom Tryon]] appeared in the episode ''"Charade of Justice"'' of the NBC western series ''[[The Road West]]'' starring [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]]. In a March 1966 episode of CBS's ''[[Lost in Space]]'' entitled "The Challenge", he played Quano, the son of a planetary ruler and Edward's son in ''[[Follow Me, Boys!]]''.

=== 1970–1989 ===
In 1971, he co-starred as a young robber released from jail, alongside [[James Stewart]] in ''[[Fools' Parade]]''. Later, he guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Room 222]]'' as an idealistic high school student who assumed the costumed identity of [[Paul Revere]] to warn of the dangers of pollution. Russell was soon signed to a ten-year contract with [[The Walt Disney Company]], where he became, according to [[Robert Osborne]], the "studio's top star of the '70s".<ref name="Osbourne2007"/> He then went on to star in ''[[The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band]]'' and ''[[The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes]]'', the latter of which spawned two sequels: ''[[Now You See Him, Now You Don't]]'' in 1972 and ''[[The Strongest Man in the World]]'' in 1975.

Russell, like his father, had a baseball career. In the early 1970s, Russell played second base for the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] minor league affiliates, the [[Bend Rainbows]],<ref name=swkrw>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1EsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gigEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7080,3033958|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal|title=Switch hitting Kurt Russell wants acting and baseball|date=July 8, 1971|page=4 }}</ref> [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]] Islanders,<ref name=rucab>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mZsrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qvoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4829,1914714|newspaper=The Telegraph|agency=Associated Press|last=Hopper|first=Betty|location=Nashua, NH|title=Russell combines acting, baseball|date= August 14, 1972|page= 18}}</ref> and [[El Paso Sun Kings#The dawn of the Sun Kings|El Paso Sun Kings]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=russel001kur |title=Kurt Russell |work=Baseball-reference.com |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}</ref> During a play early in the 1973 season, he was hit in the shoulder by a player running to second base; the collision tore the [[rotator cuff]] in Russell's right/throwing shoulder. Before his injury, he was leading the [[Texas League]] in hitting, with a .563 batting average as a switch hitter. He did not return to El Paso, but was a [[designated hitter]] for the independent [[Portland Mavericks]] back in the [[Northwest League]] late in their short season. The team was owned by his father, and he had been doing promotional work for them in the interim.<ref name=wkrtjmros>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GDpYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WvcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4325%2C2505341 |newspaper=The Bulletin |location=Bend, Oregon |agency=Associated Press |title=Wise, Kurt Russell to join Mavericks for rest of season  |date=July 27, 1973 |page=11}}</ref> The injury forced his retirement from baseball in 1973 and led to his return to acting.<ref name=bpkr>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9JhJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=coQMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1258,367525 |newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|agency=Newhouse News Service|last=Freedman|first=Richard|title=Baseball player Kurt Russell banging out hits in new field|date=August 2, 1981 |page=B6}}</ref>

In the [[autumn]] of 1976, Russell appeared with [[Tim Matheson]] in the 15-episode NBC series ''[[The Quest (1976 TV series)|The Quest]]'', the story of two young men in the [[American West]] seeking the whereabouts of their sister, a captive of the [[Cheyenne Indians|Cheyenne]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In 1979, Russell was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or a Special for the made-for-television film ''[[Elvis (1979 film)|Elvis]]''. This was his first pairing with director [[John Carpenter]]. Russell did not perform the singing vocals in the film, they were provided by country music artist [[Ronnie McDowell]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

During the 1980s, Russell teamed with Carpenter several times, helping create some of his best-known roles, usually as [[anti-hero]]es, including the infamous [[Snake Plissken]] of ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Escape from L.A.]]'' Among their collaborations was ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), based upon the short story ''[[Who Goes There?]]'' by [[John W. Campbell, Jr.]], which had been interpreted on film before, albeit loosely, in 1951's ''[[The Thing from Another World]]''. In 1986, the two made ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'', a dark kung-fu comedy/action film in which Russell played a truck driver caught in an ancient Chinese war. The film was a financial failure like ''The Thing'', it has since gained a cult audience. After voicing adult Copper in the animated [[Disney film]] ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'', Russell is one of the very few famous child stars in Hollywood who has been able to continue his acting career past his teen years. He received award nominations well into middle age, including a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture for his performance with [[Meryl Streep]] in ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983).

=== 1990–present ===
[[File:Kurt Russell.jpg|thumb|upright|Russell in 2005]]
Russell played Lt. Stephen "Bull" McCaffre in ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'' (1991), [[Wyatt Earp]] in ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' (1993) and Colonel Jack O'Neil in the [[military science fiction]] film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' (1994).

[[Elvis Presley]] connections have run like a thread through his career. Aside from appearing as a child in one of Presley's films and giving a convincing portrayal of the singer in the 1979 television biopic, Russell starred as an Elvis impersonator involved in a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] robbery in ''[[3000 Miles to Graceland]]''. His portrayal of U.S. Olympic hockey coach [[Herb Brooks]] in the 2004 film ''[[Miracle (film)|Miracle]]'', won the praise of critics. "In many ways," wrote Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'', "''Miracle'' belongs to Kurt Russell." [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' wrote, "Russell does real acting here." [[Elvis Mitchell]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Mr. Russell's cagey and remote performance gives ''Miracle'' its few breezes of fresh, albeit methane-scented, air."

In 2006, Russell revealed that he was the director of ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'', not George P. Cosmatos, as credited.<ref name="beck">Beck, Henry Cabot. {{Wayback |date=20070122213246 |url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/archives/westerns/2006/western-russell_godfather_10_06.htm |title="The "Western" Godfather."}} ''True West Magazine''. October 2006.</ref> According to Russell, Cosmatos was recommended by [[Sylvester Stallone]] and was, in effect, a ghost director, much as he had been for ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. Russell said he promised Cosmatos he would keep it a secret as long as Cosmatos was alive; Cosmatos died in April 2005.<ref name="beck" /> Russell owns the rights to the masters and makes reference to possibly re-editing the film, as he was not originally involved in the editing.<ref name="beck" />

Russell played the villain Stuntman Mike in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s segment ''[[Death Proof]]'' of the film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''. After a remake of ''Escape from New York'' was announced, Russell was reportedly upset with the casting of Scottish actor [[Gerard Butler]] for his signature character, Snake Plissken, as he believed the character 'was quintessentially [...] American.'<ref>{{cite web|author=Stax |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/775/775013p1.html | title = IGN: Kurt Blasts 'Escape' Remake |publisher=Movies.ign.com |date=March 22, 2007 |accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/russell-enraged-with-new-snake-plissken-r75552.htm | title = News Russell Enraged with New Snake Plissken |publisher=Pr-inside.com |date= |accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref>

Russell appeared in ''[[The Battered Bastards of Baseball]]'', a documentary about his father and the Portland Mavericks, which debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2014.<ref>[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/01/13/kurt-russell-sundance-baseball Sundance 2014: Kurt Russell goes deep for 'Battered Bastards of Baseball' -- EXCLUSIVE]</ref> He co-starred in the action thriller ''[[Furious 7]]'' (2015).<ref>http://flicksided.com/2013/08/31/kurt-russell-joins-fast-and-furious-7-cast/</ref>

== Personal life ==
[[File:KurtRussellSept2013TIFF.jpg|thumb|left|Russell at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
Russell married actress [[Season Hubley]], whom he had met on the set of ''[[Elvis (1979 film)|Elvis]]'' in 1979; they had a son, Boston Russell, in 1980. In 1983, in the middle of his divorce from Hubley, Russell re-connected with [[Goldie Hawn]] on the set of the film ''[[Swing Shift (film)|Swing Shift]]'', and they have been in a relationship ever since. They own a home in [[Palm Desert, California]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Meeks|first1=Eric G.|title=Palm Springs Celebrity Homes: Little Tuscany, Racquet Club, Racquet Club Estates and Desert Park Estates Neighborhoods|date=2012 |page=452 (location number) |publisher=Horatio Limburger Oglethorpe|format=Kindle|asin= B00A2PXD1G}}</ref> They had a son, [[Wyatt Russell|Wyatt]], in 1986. One year later, in 1987, the couple starred in the film ''[[Overboard (1987 film)|Overboard]]''. Hawn's son and daughter with [[Bill Hudson (singer)|Bill Hudson]], actors [[Oliver Hudson|Oliver]] and [[Kate Hudson]], consider Russell to be their father.

Russell is a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]. In 1996, he was quoted in the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' saying: "I was brought up as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], but when I realized that at the end of the day there wasn't much difference between a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and Republican, I became a libertarian."<ref>[http://www.theadvocates.org/libertarianism-101/libertarian-celebrities/kurt-russell/ Kurt Russell], [[Advocates for Self-Government]]</ref> In February 2003, Russell and Hawn moved to [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], so that their son could play hockey. Russell is an FAA licensed private pilot holding single/multi-engine and [[instrument rating]]s and is an Honorary Board Member of the humanitarian aviation organization [[Wings of Hope (charity)|Wings of Hope]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wings-of-hope.org |title=:.: The Official Wings Of Hope Homepage :.: |publisher=Wings-of-hope.org |date= |accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|magazine=AOPA Pilot|title=A Plane Crazy America|page=79|date=May 2014}}</ref>
