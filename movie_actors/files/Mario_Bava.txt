'''Mario Bava''' (31 July 1914 – 25 April 1980) was an Italian [[film director|director]], [[screenwriter]], [[special effect|special effects artist]] and [[cinematographer]] from the "[[golden age]]" of [[Italian people|Italian]] [[horror films]]. His work kick-started the [[giallo]] film genre and the modern "[[slasher film]]".<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Mario Bava|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/81044/Mario-Bava}}</ref>

== Biography ==

Mario Bava was born in [[Sanremo]], [[Liguria]] on July 31, 1914. He is the son of [[Eugenio Bava]], a sculptor who also worked as a special effects photographer and cameraman in the Italian silent movie industry. Mario Bava's first ambition was to become a painter. Unable to turn out paintings at a profitable rate, he went into his father's business, working as an assistant to other Italian cinematographers like Massimo Terzano. He also helped his father at the special effects department at [[Benito Mussolini]]'s film factory, the Istituto LUCE.

Bava became a cinematographer in his own right in 1939, shooting two short films with [[Roberto Rossellini]]. He made his feature debut in the early 1940s. Bava's camerawork was an instrumental factor in developing the screen personas of such stars of the period as [[Gina Lollobrigida]], [[Steve Reeves]] and [[Aldo Fabrizi]].

Bava completed filming ''[[I Vampiri|I vampiri]]'' (aka ''The Devil's Commandment'') for director [[Riccardo Freda]] in 1956, a movie now referred to as the first Italian horror film. Bava was originally hired as the cinematographer, but when Freda walked out on the project midway through production, Bava completed the film in several days, even creating the innovative special effects that were needed. He also handled the cinematography and special effects on the 1955 Kirk Douglas epic ''Ulysses'' and the 1957 Steve Reeves classic ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'', two films credited with sparking the Italian [[sword and sandal]] genre.

Bava co-directed ''[[The Day the Sky Exploded]]'' in 1958, the first Italian [[science fiction film|science fiction]] film, predating even the sci-fi films of Antonio Margheriti. Because he had no earlier credited experience as a director, the film was credited solely to [[Paolo Heusch]]. In 1959, Bava completed ''[[Caltiki - the Immortal Monster]]'', again for Riccardo Freda who left the project prematurely, and also worked on the lighting and special effects for ''[[Hercules Unchained]]'' and ''[[The Giant of Marathon]]''.

In 1960, Bava directed the gothic horror classic ''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|Black Sunday]]'', his first solo directorial effort, which made a genre star out of [[Barbara Steele]]. His use of light and dark in black-and-white films is widely acclaimed along with his spectacular use of color in films such as ''[[Black Sabbath (film)|Black Sabbath]]'', ''[[Kill, Baby... Kill!]]'',  ''[[Blood and Black Lace]]'' and ''[[The Whip and the Body]]''.

His work has proved very influential. Bava directed what is now regarded as the earliest of the Italian [[giallo]] films, ''[[The Girl Who Knew Too Much (1963 film)|The Girl Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1963) and ''[[Blood and Black Lace]]'' (1964). His 1965 sci-fi/ horror film ''[[Planet of the Vampires]]'' was a thematic precursor to ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979). Although comic books had served as the basis for countless serials and children's films in Hollywood, Bava's ''[[Danger: Diabolik]]'' (1968) brought an adult perspective to the genre. Many elements of his 1966 film ''[[Kill, Baby... Kill!]]'', regarded by [[Martin Scorsese]] as Bava's masterpiece, also appear in the Asian strain of terror film known as [[Japanese horror|J-horror]].  1971's ''[[Twitch of the Death Nerve]]'' is considered one of the earliest [[slasher film]]s, and was explicitly imitated in ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]''. 

Mario Bava was very disappointed with the distribution of some of his later films. His ''[[Lisa and the Devil]]'' (1972) was never picked up by a distributor, and had to be later re-edited by the producer (with new 1975 footage) into an ''Exorcist''-clone retitled ''House of Exorcism'' in order to get released. Bava's ''[[Semaforo Rosso]]'' (1974) was never released theatrically during his lifetime; the film only appeared on DVD in the late 1990s, re-edited with some new footage as ''Rabid Dogs'', and was released on DVD in 2007 in a slightly altered version under the title ''Kidnapped''. 

Bava retired in 1978 (at age 63) after co-directing his last horror film, ''[[Shock (1977 film)|Shock]]'', with his son [[Lamberto Bava]] (although he also did some special effects matte work on Dario Argento's 1980 movie ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]''). Bava died of natural causes in 1980 at age 65. His doctor had given him a physical just days before he died from a heart attack, and had pronounced him in perfect health.

Mario Bava's son [[Lamberto Bava]] worked for fourteen years as Bava's assistant director (beginning with ''Planet of the Vampires''), and went on to become a horror film director on his own. On several of Mario's movies, Mario was credited as John M. Old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue05/infocus/intro2.htm |title=The Golden-Age of Italian Horror: c. 1957-1979 |last=Johnson |first=Gary |work=imagesjournal.com |accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> Later, Lamberto was sometimes credited as John M. Old, Jr.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/68285 |title=BAVA, Lamberto |work=[[British Film Institute|bfi.org.uk]] |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> When Lamberto directed his first solo film ''Macabre'' in 1980, Mario commented "Now I can die in peace". (He actually did die several months later.)

Several books have been published about Mario Bava: ''Mario Bava'' by Pascal Martinet (Edilig, 1984) and ''Mario Bava'' edited by Jean-Louis Leutrat (Éditions du Céfal, 1994) in French; ''Mario Bava'' by Alberto Pezzotta (Il Castoro Cinema, 1995) in Italian; ''The Haunted Worlds of Mario Bava'' by Troy Howarth (FAB Press, 2002) and most recently, the massive critical biography ''Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark'' by [[Tim Lucas]] (Video Watchdog, 2007; ISBN 0-9633756-1-X).
