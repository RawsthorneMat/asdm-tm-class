'''Zhang Ziyi''' (born 9 February 1979), sometimes credited as '''Ziyi Zhang''', is a Chinese actress and model. She is considered one of the [[Four Dan Actresses]] of China.<ref>[http://enjoy.eastday.com/eastday/enjoy/node58771/node58833/node123877/userobject1ai1914104.html Four Promising Actress] [http://ent.cctv.com/special/special/C18421/index.shtml Four Young Chinese Stars]</ref>

Her first major role was in [[The Road Home (1999 film)|''The Road Home'']] (1999). She achieved fame in the West after leading roles in ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000), ''[[Rush Hour 2]]'' (2001), ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002), ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' (2004), [[2046 (film)|2046]] (2004), and ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' (2005). She has been nominated for three [[BAFTA Awards|BAFTA Award]]s and a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]].

==Early life==
Zhang was born and raised in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. Her parents were Zhang Yuanxiao, an accountant and later economist, and Li Zhousheng, a kindergarten teacher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-08/04/content_466306_3.htm |title=In the mood for oriental siren Zhang Ziyi |work=China Daily  |accessdate=16 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=time/> She is very close to her older brother, Zhang Zinan ({{zh|c=章子男|p=Zhāng Zǐnán}}; born 1973). Zhang began studying dance when she was 8 years old; subsequently, she joined the [[Beijing Dance Academy]] by her parents' suggestion at the age of 11.<ref>[http://csc.ziyi.org/news/haorizi-article-t.html "Zhang Ziyi, The One that Loves You Most Is Me"]. ''Hao Rizi Magazine''. March 2002. Retrieved 11 May 2010.</ref> While at this boarding school, she noticed how mean the other girls were to each other while competing for status amongst the teachers. Zhang disliked the attitudes of her peers and teachers so much that, on one occasion, she ran away from the school.<ref name=time>[http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/1211/zhang.ziyi.html "She Makes Magic"] ''TIMEasia.com'' 11 December 2000. Retrieved 13 February 2009.</ref> At the age of 15, Zhang won the national youth dance championship and began appearing in television commercials in Hong Kong.<ref>[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800424122/bio "Ziyi Zhang Biography – Yahoo! Movies"]. ''Yahoo!''. 11 May 2010.</ref>

In 1996, Zhang entered China's prestigious [[Central Academy of Drama]] at the age of 17.

==Career==

===Early career (1999-2000)===
In 1998, while she was studying in [[Central Academy of Drama]], she was offered her first role by director [[Zhang Yimou]] in his film ''[[The Road Home (1999 film)|The Road Home]]''.  The film won the Silver Bear prize at the 2000 [[Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>[http://www1.chinaculture.org/library/2008-01/18/content_71563_3.htm "Award for The Road Home"] retrieved 30 April 2013</ref>

===Gongfu epics and international breakthrough (2000-2005)===
She rose to international fame in 2000 with her role as Jen (Chinese version: Yu Jiao Long) in ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', for which she won several awards in the Western world, such as [[Chicago Film Critics Association Awards]], [[Toronto Film Critics Association Awards]] and [[Independent Spirit Awards]].<ref>[http://www.emanuellevy.com/oscar/oscar-history-foreign-language-films-as-best-picture-nominees-1/ "Best Foreign Language Film"] retrieved 30 April 2013</ref> Her character is a young [[Manchu]] noblewoman who has secretly learned martial arts and runs off to become a wandering swordswoman rather than commit to an arranged marriage.

Although she has done many acrobatic fight scenes in ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'' and later movies, Zhang does not actually know [[Chinese martial arts]]; rather, she relies on her dancing skills to mimic the Gongfu choreography.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0955471/bio</ref>

Zhang's first appearance in an American movie was in ''[[Rush Hour 2]]''.<ref>[http://entertainment.xin.msn.com/en/celebrity/features/asia/photos.aspx?cp-documentid=5866224&page=6 Happy birthday, Zhang Ziyi!]. 10 February 2012.</ref> Her character's name is "Hu Li", which is Mandarin Chinese for "Fox".

Zhang then appeared in ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002), directed by her early mentor [[Zhang Yimou]]. She plays Moon (Ru Yue), the assistant and student of Broken Sword, played by [[Tony Leung]]. The film was commercially successful in the United States and was nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] and a [[Golden Globe]] award in the category of Best Foreign Language Film.

She then signed on to film an ''avant-garde'' drama, ''[[Purple Butterfly]]'' (2003), which competed in the 2003 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. 

Zhang went back to the martial arts genre in ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' (2004), again by Zhang Yimou, where she starred along [[Takashi Kaneshiro]] and [[Andy Lau]]. She plays the blind dancing girl Mei, who despite the lack of eyesight is a skilled fighter. In preparing for the part, Zhang spent two months living with an actual blind girl. The performance earned her a Best Actress nomination from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]. She was also featured on the ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' soundtrack with her own musical rendition of the ancient Chinese poem, ''Jia Rén Qu'' (佳人曲, ''The Beauty Song''). The song was also featured in two scenes in the film.

In ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]'' (2004), directed by [[Wong Kar-wai]], starring many of the best-known Chinese actors and actresses, Zhang was the female lead and won the Hong Kong Film Critics' Best Actress Award and the [[Hong Kong Film Awards|Hong Kong Film Academy]]'s Best Actress Award.

Showing her whimsical musical [[tap-dancing]] side, Zhang starred in ''[[Princess Raccoon]]'', directed by Japan's [[Seijun Suzuki]], who was honored at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]].

===English-speaking roles (2005-2009)===
She played the lead role of Sayuri in the American [[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|film adaptation]] based on the international bestseller ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha]]'', a challenging role as all of her dialogue would be in English. Controversy also arose in Japan and [[Mainland China|China]] about having a Chinese woman portray a Japanese [[geisha]]. For this film, she was reunited with her ''2046'' co-star [[Gong Li]] and with ''Crouching Tiger'' co-star [[Michelle Yeoh]]. For the role, Zhang received a 2006 [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination, a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nomination and a [[BAFTA]] nomination.

On 27 June 2005, she accepted an invitation to join the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS), placing her among the ranks of those able to vote on the [[Academy Awards]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071218192506/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2005/05.06.24.html "Academy Invites 112 to Membership"] Oscars. 24 June 2005. Retrieved 13 February 2009.</ref> In May 2006, Zhang was chosen as a jury member of ''Feature Films'' at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=THE Juries 2006|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/2006/juryLongFilm.html|publisher=festival-cannes.com|accessdate=28 May 2006}}</ref> 

She returned to China for another period drama,''[[The Banquet (2006 film)|The Banquet]]'', in 2006; although this time with less action than her three previous films in the genre.

She gave another English performance as the original voice of [[Karai (character)|Karai]] in the American animated film ''[[TMNT (film)|TMNT]]'' (2007). 

In ''[[Forever Enthralled]]'' (2008), which tells the story of legendary [[Peking opera]] actor [[Mei Lanfang]], Zhang appears in the second act as one of the first biologically female Peking opera actresses; before the [[May Fourth Movement]] all female characters had been played by men. Her most distinctive trait is that she specializes in portraying elderly ''male'' characters, as a parallel to the biologically male Mei Lanfang who specialized in young female characters.

Her next American film was ''[[The Horsemen (2009 film)|The Horsemen]]'' (2009), where she starred opposite [[Dennis Quaid]]. In the same year she had a small cameo in ''[[The Founding of a Republic]]''.

===Recent projects (2010-present)===

In January 2010, it was announced she had plans to produce a film adaptation of ''[[Snow Flower and the Secret Fan]]''; however, it was announced that she had turned down the role due to a busy schedule.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/1033643/1/.html "Zhang Ziyi quits "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"].

==Personal life==
Zhang was engaged to [[Aviv Nevo|Aviv "Vivi" Nevo]], a [[venture capitalist]]. They separated in late 2010:

{{cquote|I grew up in a very traditional Chinese environment with lots of love, and I hope my own family would be the same.

In the July 2006 issue of ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, Zhang Ziyi spoke of her movies' contents and being careful about the roles she takes on, especially in Hollywood:

{{cquote|Yes. Otherwise I could have done a lot of Hollywood movies. After ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' I got a lot of offers, but I turned them down because they were all victim roles—poor girls sold to America to be a wife or whatever. I know I have the ability to go deeper, to take on more original roles than that. That's why I really appreciated ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Geisha]]'', because it allowed us to show the world what kind of actors we are and what kind of characters we can play—not just action, kick-ass parts.<ref>[http://www.helloziyi.us/Articles/interview-magazine-july2006.htm "Ziyi"] ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''.
