==Personal life==
Luhrmann was born in Sydney. His mother, Barbara Carmel (née Brennan), was a ballroom dance teacher and dress shop owner, and his father, Leonard Luhrmann, was a farmer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/28/Baz-Luhrmann.html|title=Baz Luhrmann profile at|work=FilmReference.com}}</ref><ref>[http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/movies/man-of-many-talents/story-e6freqex-1111118148222]</ref><ref>[http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/h/a/r/Jennifer-Harrison-Chisholm/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0318.html Luhrmann-related genealogy site]</ref> He was raised in [[Herons Creek, New South Wales|Herons Creek]], a tiny rural settlement in northern [[New South Wales]] where his father ran a petrol station and a movie theatre. He attended St Joseph's Hasting Regional School, [[Port Macquarie]] (1975–1978) and at [[St Paul's College, Manly]], performing in the school's version of Shakespeare's ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]''.

Luhrmann officially changed his given name from Mark to Baz sometime around 1979.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baz Luhrmann i(10 works by) (birth name: Mark Anthony Luhrmann) (a.k.a. Bazmark Anthony Luhrmann)|url=http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/OLD?id=A3x&idtype=oldid|work=AustLit|publisher=AustLit|accessdate=6 February 2014|year=2014}}</ref> Luhrmann then first auditioned for the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] (NIDA) in 1980 but was not accepted. He successfully auditioned again two years later, starting the three-year acting course in 1983. He graduated from NIDA in 1985, alongside [[Sonia Todd]], [[Catherine McClements]] and [[Justin Monjo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nida.edu.au/ALUMNI/default.aspx |title=NIDA Alumni}}</ref> On 26 January 1997, he married [[Catherine Martin (designer)|Catherine Martin]], a [[production designer]]; the couple have two children.

*''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' (1996)
*''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001)
*''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'' (2008)
