==Early life and background==
Daniel Boyle was born on 20&nbsp;October 1956<ref name=whoswho/> in [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester|Radcliffe]], [[Lancashire]], to Irish parents from [[County Galway]].<ref name="nytimes">{{Cite journal | title = Danny Boyle | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/person/188724/Danny-Boyle/biography | publisher = ''New York Times'' | accessdate = 29 October 2008 | ref = harv | postscript = <!--none--> }}</ref><ref name="yahoo!movies">{{Cite journal | title = Danny Boyle - Biography | url = http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/person/danny-boyle/biography.html | publisher = ''Yahoo!

Boyle was an altar boy for eight years and his mother had the priesthood in mind for him, but aged&nbsp;14 he was persuaded by a priest not to transfer from school to a [[seminary]].<ref name="irishindependent">{{Citation | title = The man who could have been pope | last = Caden | first = Sarah | url = http://www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3?ca=129&si=1401311&issue_id=12514 | publisher = ''Sunday Independent''| date = 22 May 2005 | accessdate = 23 February 2009}}</ref>

==Career==

===Theatre===
[[File:The Children's Monologues cast (2010).jpg|thumb|Boyle with the cast of ''[[The Children's Monologues]]'' in 2010]]
Upon leaving school he began his career at the [[Joint Stock Theatre Company]], before moving onto the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in 1982 where he directed ''The Genius'' by [[Howard Brenton]] and ''Saved'' by [[Edward Bond]]. He also directed five productions for the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]].<ref name="fleapit">{{Cite news | title = From fleapit to the red carpet | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4789045/From-fleapit-to-the-red-carpet.html | last = Grice | first = Elizabeth | publisher = Telegraph.co.uk | date = 24 February 2009 | accessdate = 11 March 2009 | location=London | ref = harv | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref> On 14 November 2010, he directed a one night play at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] titled ''[[The Children's Monologues (play)|The Children's Monologues]]'' with Sir [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Gemma Arterton]] and [[Eddie Redmayne]] as the cast.

Boyle was Artistic Director for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]] in [[London]]. Over the years, Olympic Opening Ceremonies have become multi-million pound theatrical shows, which have become known for their extravagance and pageantry to celebrate the start of the largest multi-sport event in the world. The ceremony, entitled ''Isles of Wonder'', charted aspects of British culture, including the [[Industrial Revolution]] and British contributions to literature, music, film and technology. Reception to the ceremony was generally positive, both nationally in the United Kingdom and internationally.<ref name=Reception>{{cite news |title=Media reaction to London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19025686 |publisher=BBC News |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/video/2012-07/28/c_131744486.htm|title=London Olympics opening ceremony kicks off|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last=Lyall|first=Sarah|title=A Five-Ring Opening Circus, Weirdly and Unabashedly British|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/28/sports/olympics/in-olympic-opening-ceremony-britain-asserts-its-eccentric-identity.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|newspaper=New York Times|date=27 July 2012}}</ref><ref name="media">{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19025686|title=Media reaction to London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref> In December 2012 it was widely reported that Boyle turned down a knighthood in the [[New Year Honours]] list. He told BBC Radio 4 “I’m very proud to be an equal citizen and I think that’s what the Opening Ceremony was actually about.” In 2014, it was announced that Boyle would become a patron of [[HOME (Manchester)|HOME]] in Manchester.<ref>[http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2014/01/new-manchester-venue-home-appoints-danny-boyle-patron/The Stage New Manchester venue Home appoints Danny Boyle as patron ]</ref>

===Television===
In 1987 Boyle started working in television as a producer for [[BBC Northern Ireland]] where he produced, amongst other TV films, [[Alan Clarke]]'s controversial ''[[Elephant (Alan Clarke film)|Elephant]]'' before becoming a director on shows such as ''Arise And Go Now'', ''Not Even God Is Wise Enough'', ''For The Greater Good'', ''Scout'' and two<ref>{{cite web | title = Danny Boyle Biography (1956–)| publisher = Film Reference.com| url = http://www.filmreference.com/film/28/Danny-Boyle.html| accessdate = 5 November 2009}}</ref> episodes of ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]''. These were ''Masonic Mysteries'' and ''Cherubim and Seraphim''. He was also responsible for the [[BBC Two|BBC2]] series ''Mr. Wroe's Virgins''.<ref name="fleapit"/> Danny Boyle is not to be confused with a different Daniel Boyle, who is not related, who scripted five original teleplays for ''Inspector Morse'' at about this time, and who has continued to write and adapt crime stories for television including the first episode of [[List of Lewis episodes#Series 1: 2007|Lewis]], and much of the popular series ''[[Hamish Macbeth (TV series)|Hamish Macbeth]]''.<ref>[http://www.blakefriedmann.co.uk/filmClients/_338/ Agent's webpage for Daniel Boyle (writer)]</ref>

In between the [[feature film|films]] ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'' and ''[[28 Days Later]]'' Boyle directed two TV films for the BBC in 2001 – ''[[Vacuuming Completely Nude In Paradise]]'' and ''[[Strumpet (film)|Strumpet]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2009/03/the-danny-boyle-project-part-five-vacuuming-completely-nude-in-paradise.html|title=The Danny Boyle Project, Part Five: "Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise"|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}</ref> He has also appeared on ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' and drove the fastest wet lap at that time.

===Films===
Boyle's love for film began with his first viewing of ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'':
<blockquote>It had eviscerated my brain, completely. I was an impressionable twenty-one-year-old guy from the sticks. My brain had not been fed and watered with great culture, you know, as art is meant to do. It had been sandblasted by the power of cinema. And that’s why cinema, despite everything we try to do, it remains a young man’s medium, really, in terms of audience.<ref>Boyle, Danny. Interview by Robert K. Elder. ''The Film That Changed My Life'' by Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p28. Print.</ref></blockquote>

The first film Boyle directed was ''[[Shallow Grave]]''.<ref name="fleapit"/>  The film was the most commercially successful British film of 1995<ref name="Mayer">{{Harvnb|Mayer|McDonnell|2007|pp=377–380.}}</ref> and led to the production of ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', based on the novel by [[Irvine Welsh]].<ref>{{Cite journal | title = BFI Top 100 British films | url = http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/bfi100/1-10.html | publisher = BFI | date = 6 September 2006 | accessdate = 23 February 2009 | ref = harv | postscript = <!--none--> }}</ref>  Working with writer [[John Hodge (screenwriter)|John Hodge]] and producer [[Andrew Macdonald (producer)|Andrew Macdonald]], ''Shallow Grave'' earned Boyle the Best Newcomer Award from the 1996 London Film Critics Circle.<ref name="Mayer"/>  ''Shallow Grave'' and ''Trainspotting'' caused critics to claim that Boyle had revitalised British cinema in the early '90s.<ref name="fleapit"/>

He then moved to Hollywood and sought a production deal with a major US studio. He declined an offer to direct the fourth film of the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' franchise, instead making ''[[A Life Less Ordinary]]'' using British finance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/apr/06/film|title=Bringing a ray of sunshine to British films|publisher=The Guardian | location=London|first=Jane|last=Martinson|date=5 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wearemoviegeeks.com/2009/01/danny-boyle-asked-about-alien-4-lady-vengeance-28-days-later-sequel-and-more|title=Danny Boyle Asked About ‘Alien 4′, ‘Lady Vengeance’, ’28 Days Later...’ Sequel, and More|publisher=WeAreMovieGeeks}}</ref>

Boyle's next project was an adaptation of the cult novel ''[[The Beach (novel)|The Beach]]''. Filmed in [[Thailand]] with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] in a starring role, casting of the film led to a feud with [[Ewan McGregor]], star of his first three films.<ref name="fleapit"/>  He then collaborated with author [[Alex Garland]] on the post-apocalyptic horror film ''[[28 Days Later]]''.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Another bright idea from Mr Sunshine | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3663788/Another-bright-idea-from-Mr-Sunshine.html | last = Hiscock | first = John | date = 3 April 2007 | publisher = telegraph.co.uk | accessdate = 26 February 2009 | location=London | ref = harv | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref>

He also directed a short film ''[[Alien Love Triangle]]'' (starring [[Kenneth Branagh]]), and was intended to be one of three shorts within a feature film. However the project was cancelled after the two other shorts were made into feature films: ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' starring [[Mira Sorvino]] and ''[[Impostor (film)|Impostor]]'' starring [[Gary Sinise]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,2256450,00.html|title=Aliens come to Wales|publisher=Guardian.co.uk|accessdate=1 March 2008| location=London | first=Mark | last=Kermode | date=15 February 2008}}</ref>

[[File:DannyBoyle08TIFF.jpg|thumb|left|Boyle at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
In 2008 he directed ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'', the story of an impoverished child ([[Dev Patel]]) on the streets of [[Mumbai]], [[India]] who competes on [[Kaun Banega Crorepati|India's version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'']], for which Boyle won an [[Academy Award]]. The film won eight Academy Awards in total.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Oscar winners: Slumdog Millionaire and Kate Winslet lead British film sweep  | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/oscars/4786193/Oscar-winners-Slumdog-Millionaire-and-Kate-Winslet-triumph-in-great-night-for-British-film.html | last = Singh | first = Anita | date = 23 February 2009 | publisher = ''telegraph.co.uk'' | accessdate = 23 February 2009 | location=London | ref = harv | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref> ''"To be a film-maker...you have to lead. You have to be psychotic in your desire to do something. People always like the easy route. You have to push very hard to get something unusual, something different."''<ref name="fleapit"/>  Andrew Macdonald, producer of ''Trainspotting'', said "Boyle takes a subject that you've often seen portrayed realistically, in a politically correct way, whether it's junkies or slum orphans, and he has managed to make it realistic but also incredibly uplifting and joyful."<ref name="fleapit"/>

In 2010, Boyle directed the film ''[[127 Hours]]'', starring [[James Franco]] and featuring [[Amber Tamblyn]] and [[Kate Mara]]. It was based on Aron Ralston's autobiography ''[[Between a Rock and a Hard Place (book)|Between a Rock and a Hard Place]]'', which detailed his struggle of being trapped under a boulder while [[canyoneering]] alone in [[Blue John Canyon]], southeastern [[Utah]], and resorting to desperate measures in order to survive. The film was released on 5 November 2010 to critical acclaim. The film got six nominations at the [[83rd Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Boyle and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Franco.

Boyle's next film was ''[[Trance (2013 film)|Trance]]'', while another installment of the ''28 Days Later'' franchise is in the development stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/11/12/danny-boyle-on-28-months-later-its-not-called-28-months-later/ |title=Danny Boyle On '28 Months Later': It's Not Called '28 Months Later'! |accessdate=21 December 2009 |work=MTV Movies Blog }}</ref><ref>dreadcentral.com, "[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/40278/exclusive-danny-boyle-directing-next-28-days-later-sequel?

Boyle told an interviewer about the eclectic range of his films, "There's a theme running through all of them&mdash;and I just realised this. They're all about someone facing impossible odds and overcoming them."<ref>{{cite news |last= Himes |first= Geoffrey |title= SXSW: Danny Boyle talks up new film ''Trance'' |work= [[Baltimore City Paper]] |location= Baltimore, Maryland |publisher= |date= March 12, 2013 |url= http://blogs.citypaper.com/noise/index.php/2013/03/sxsw-danny-boyle-talks-up-new-film-trance/ |accessdate= April 2, 2013}}</ref>

In a webchat interview with ''[[Empire Magazine]]'', Boyle stated on more than one occasion his enthusiasm to work again with [[Ewan McGregor]] on his next feature film.

Due to his interest in music, Boyle has mentioned in interviews that he has considered a [[musical film]] with original compositions. Boyle has also expressed interest in an [[animated movie]], and, in 2013, a sequel to ''28 Weeks Later''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esZrZWQ6jcI|title=MOVIE CON III: Danny Boyle and Christian Colson Part 3|publisher=[[Empire Magazine]]|accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref>
