==Career==
[[File:Tommyleejones.jpg|right|thumb|Jones in August 2006]]

Jones moved to New York to become an actor, making his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1969's ''[[A Patriot for Me]]'' in a number of supporting roles. In 1970 he landed his first film role, coincidentally playing a Harvard student in ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'' ([[Erich Segal]], the author of ''[[Love Story (novel)|Love Story]]'', said that he based the lead character of Oliver on the two undergraduate roommates he knew while attending Harvard, Jones and Gore).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/books/20segal.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Erich Segal, ‘Love Story' Author, Dies at 72 | first=Margalit | last=Fox | date=January 20, 2010 | accessdate=March 28, 2010}}</ref>

In early 1971, he returned to Broadway in [[Abe Burrows]]' ''[[Four on a Garden]]'' where he shared the stage with [[Carol Channing]] and [[Sid Caesar]]. Between 1971 and 1975 he portrayed [[Mark Toland|Dr. Mark Toland]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] soap opera, ''[[One Life to Live]]''. He returned to the stage for a 1974 production of ''[[Ulysses in Nighttown]]'' with [[Zero Mostel]]. It was followed by the acclaimed TV movie ''[[The Amazing Howard Hughes]]'', where he played the lead role.

In films, he played an escaped convict hunted in ''Jackson County Jail'' (1976), a Vietnam veteran in ''[[Rolling Thunder (film)|Rolling Thunder]]'' (1977) and an automobile mogul, co-starring with [[Laurence Olivier]], in the [[Harold Robbins]] drama ''[[The Betsy]]''.

In 1980, Jones earned his first [[Golden Globe]] nomination for his portrayal of country singer [[Loretta Lynn]]'s husband, [[Oliver Lynn|Doolittle "Mooney" Lynn]], in the popular ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (film)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]''. In 1981 he played a drifter opposite [[Sally Field]] in ''[[Back Roads (1981 film)|Back Roads]]'', a comedy that received middling reviews.<ref name="airplane">{{cite web | publisher=imdb.com/ |title=Back Roads | work=Business Date for Back Roads | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082042/business | accessdate=March 12, 2006}}</ref>

In 1983, he received an [[Emmy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/tommy-lee-jones |title=Tommy Lee Jones Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}</ref> for Best Actor for his performance as murderer [[Gary Gilmore]] in a TV adaptation of [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Executioner's Song]]''. That same year he starred in a pirate adventure, ''[[Nate and Hayes]]'', playing the heavily-bearded pirate Captain [[Bully Hayes]].

In 1989, he earned another Emmy nomination for his portrayal of Texas Ranger lawman [[Woodrow F. Call]] in the acclaimed television mini-series ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'', based on the best-seller by [[Larry McMurtry]].

In the 1990s, blockbuster hits such as ''[[The Fugitive (1993 film)|The Fugitive]]'' co-starring [[Harrison Ford]], ''[[Batman Forever]]'' co-starring [[Val Kilmer]], and ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]'' with [[Will Smith]] made Jones one of the best-paid and most in-demand actors in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]]. His performance in ''The Fugitive'' received broad acclaim and an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] and a [[U.S. Marshals (film)|sequel]]. When he accepted his [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], his head was [[head shaving|shaved]] for his role in the film ''[[Cobb (film)|Cobb]],'' which he made light of in his speech: "The only thing a man can say at a time like this is 'I am not really bald'. Actually I'm lucky to be working".

Among his other well-known performances during the 1990s were those of the accused conspirator [[Clay Shaw]]/Clay Bertrand in the 1991 film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (which earned him another Oscar nomination), as a terrorist who hijacks a U.S. Navy battleship in ''[[Under Siege]]'' and as a maximum-security prison warden who's in way over his head in ''[[Natural Born Killers]]''.

Jones co-starred with director [[Clint Eastwood]] as astronauts in the 2000 film ''[[Space Cowboys]]'', in which both played retired pilots and friends/rivals leading a space rescue mission together.

[[File:Tommy Lee Jones Cannes.jpg|thumb|left|Jones at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]]]]

In 2005, the first theatrical feature film Jones directed, ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'', was presented at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]]. Jones's character speaks both English and Spanish in the film. His performance won him the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]] Award. His first film as a director had been ''[[The Good Old Boys (film)|The Good Old Boys]]'' in 1995, a made-for-television movie.

Two strong performances in 2007 marked a resurgence in Jones's career, one as a beleaguered father investigating the disappearance of his soldier son in ''[[In the Valley of Elah]]'', the other as a Texas sheriff hunting an assassin in the Oscar-winning ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]''. For the former, he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]].

Jones has been a spokesperson for Japanese brewing company [[Suntory]] since 2006. He can be seen in various Japanese TV commercials of Suntory's Coffee brand [[Boss Coffee|Boss]] as a character called "Alien Jones," an extraterrestrial who takes the form of a human being to check on the world of humans. There are 34 such commercials, many of which can be seen on YouTube.<ref name="commercials">{{cite web | title=いいなCM　サントリー　BOSS　宇宙人ジョーンズシリーズ (Suntory Boss - Space Alien Jones Series) | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9CoqIVXCUU | accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> In 2011, Jones appeared in [[public service announcements]] on Japanese television, joining a number of other popular figures who sang two sentimental songs in remembrance of those lost in the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]].

In 2010, Jones appeared alongside [[Ben Affleck]] in the recession drama ''[[The Company Men]]''. The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], where early reviews praised Jones's performance as "pitch-perfect."<ref>[http://www.film.com/features/story/review-company-men-sundance-film/31894447 Review: The Company Men – Sundance Film Festival – Film.com]{{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> Jones had a role in the [[Marvel Studios]] film, ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NE83q9deUnI0ag|title=Tommy Lee Jones Officially Comes Aboard Captain America: The First Avenger|publisher=MovieWeb.com}}</ref> He also directed, produced and co-starred with [[Samuel L. Jackson]] in an adaptation of ''[[The Sunset Limited]]''.

2012 saw yet another turning point in Jones's career, starting in a reprisal of his role as Agent K in ''[[Men in Black 3]]'', the romantic dramedy ''[[Hope Springs (2012 film)|Hope Springs]]'', and co-starring as [[Thaddeus Stevens]] in Steven Spielberg's ''[[Lincoln (2012 film)|Lincoln]]''. Jones's performance in ''[[Lincoln (2012 film)|Lincoln]]'' received wide critical acclaim, with many reviewers claiming that he stole the film from star [[Daniel Day-Lewis]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} For this performance, Jones received his fourth Oscar nomination, for Best Supporting Actor.

==Personal life==
At the [[2000 Democratic National Convention]], he presented the nominating speech for his college roommate, [[Al Gore]], as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s nominee for President of the United States.
