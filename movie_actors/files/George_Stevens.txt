'''George Stevens''' (December 18, 1904 – March 8, 1975) was an [[United States|American]] [[film director]], [[film producer|producer]], [[screenwriter]] and [[cinematographer]].<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', March 12, 1975, page 79.</ref>

==Biography==

===Film career===
He was born in [[Oakland, California]], and his family included his father [[Landers Stevens]] and his mother [[Georgie Cooper]], both stage actors. His uncle was drama critic [[Ashton Stevens]]. He also had two brothers, Jack and writer Aston Stevens. He learned about the stage from his parents and worked and toured with them on his path to filmmaking. He broke into the movie business as a cameraman, working on many [[Stan Laurel|Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy|Hardy]] [[short film]]s, such as ''[[Night Owls (1930 film)|Night Owls]]'' (1930). His first feature film was ''[[The Cohens and Kellys in Trouble]]'' in 1933.
[[File:George Stevens and Barbara Bel Geddes I Remember Mama.jpg|thumb|left|Stevens with [[Barbara Bel Geddes]] on set of ''I Remember Mama'']]
In 1934 he got his first directing job, the [[slapstick]] ''[[Kentucky Kernels]]''. His big break came when he directed [[Katharine Hepburn]] in ''[[Alice Adams (film)|Alice Adams]]'' in 1935. He went on in the late 1930s to direct several [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Fred Astaire]] movies, not only with the two actors together, but on their own. In 1940, he directed [[Carole Lombard]] in ''[[Vigil in the Night]]'', and the film has an alternate ending for European audiences in recognition of [[World War II]], which at the time the U.S. had not yet entered.

During World War II, Stevens joined the [[U.S. Army Signal Corps]] and headed a film unit from 1943 to 1946, under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]]. His unit shot footage documenting [[D-Day]]—including the only Allied European Front color film of the war—the liberation of Paris and the meeting of American and Soviet forces at the Elbe River, as well as horrific scenes from the Duben labor camp and the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. Stevens also helped prepare the Duben and Dachau footage and other material for presentation during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].<ref>Robert E. Conot, ''Justice at Nuremberg'', page 197</ref> In 2008, his footage was entered into the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as an "essential visual record" of World War II.<ref>Library of Congress [http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2008/08-237.html "Cinematic Classics, Legendary Stars, Comedic Legends and Novice Filmmakers Showcase the 2008 Film Registry"] ''News from the Library of Congress'' (30 December 2008)</ref>

One result of his World War II experiences was that his subsequent films became more dramatic. The motion picture ''[[I Remember Mama (film)|I Remember Mama]]'' from 1948 was the last movie that he made with comic scenes. He was responsible for such classic films as ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'', ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'', ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' and ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]''. He ended his directing career with the 1970 film ''[[The Only Game in Town (film)|The Only Game in Town]]'' with [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. In the same year, he was head of the jury at the [[20th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="berlinale 1970">{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1970/04_jury_1970/04_Jury_1970.html|title=Berlinale 1970: Juries|accessdate=2010-03-08|work=berlinale.de}}</ref> In 1973 he was a member of the jury at the [[8th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name="Moscow1973">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1973 |title=8th Moscow International Film Festival (1973) |accessdate=2012-12-25 |work=MIFF}}</ref>

===Personal life===
Stevens was the father of television and film writer-producer-director [[George Stevens, Jr.]], the first CEO and director of the [[American Film Institute]].  George Jr. produced and directed the documentary about his father ''George Stevens: A Filmmaker's Journey'' in 1984 and is the father of Stevens' grandson [[Michael Stevens (producer)|Michael Stevens]], also a television and film producer-director.

===Death===
Stevens died following a heart attack on March 8, 1975 on his ranch in [[Lancaster, California]], north of [[Los Angeles]].

==Awards==
As a [[lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army]], Stevens headed the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] unit that filmed the [[Normandy landings]] and the liberation of the [[Dachau concentration camp]]. For these contributions, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].

Stevens has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1701 Vine Street. He won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] twice, in 1951 for ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' and in 1956 for ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]''. He was also nominated in 1943 for ''[[The More the Merrier]]'', in 1954 for ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', and in 1959 for ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]''.
