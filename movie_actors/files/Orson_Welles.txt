'''George Orson Welles''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɛ|l|z}}; May 6, 1915&nbsp;– October 10, 1985) was an American actor, director, writer and producer who worked in theater, radio and film. He is best remembered for his innovative work in all three media: in theatre, most notably ''Caesar'' (1937), a groundbreaking Broadway adaptation of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''; in radio, the 1938 broadcast "[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]", one of the most famous in the history of radio; and in film, ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), consistently ranked as one of the [[List of films considered the best|all-time greatest films]].

Welles directed a number of high-profile stage productions for the [[Federal Theatre Project]] in his early twenties, including [[Voodoo Macbeth|an innovative adaptation of ''Macbeth'']] and ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''. In 1937 he and [[John Houseman]] founded the [[Mercury Theatre]], an independent repertory theatre company that presented an acclaimed series of productions on Broadway through 1941. Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 [[The War of the Worlds (radio)|radio adaptation]] of [[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''The War of the Worlds'' performed for the radio anthology series ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]''. It reportedly caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was occurring. Although some contemporary sources claim these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated,<ref name="McFarland">{{cite book |last=Bartholomew |first=Robert E. |date=2001 |title=Little Green Men, Meowing Nuns, and Head-Hunting Panics: A Study of Mass Psychogenic Illness and Social Delusion |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GeWm-zM3NEoC&lpg=PP1&dq=Little%20Green%20Men%2C%20Meowing%20Nuns%20and%20Head-Hunting%20Panics%3A&pg=PA219#v=onepage&q&f=false |location=Jefferson, N.C. |publisher=McFarland |page= |isbn=9780786409976 |accessdate=March 30, 2010 }}</ref> they rocketed Welles to notoriety.

His first film was ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), which he co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in as [[Charles Foster Kane]]. Welles was an outsider to the [[studio system]] and directed only 13 full-length films in his career. Because of this, he struggled for creative control from the [[major film studio]]s, and his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased. His distinctive directorial style featured layered and [[nonlinear narrative]] forms, innovative uses of [[lighting]] such as [[chiaroscuro]], unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, [[deep focus]] shots, and [[long take]]s. He has been praised as a major creative force and as "the ultimate [[auteur theory|auteur]]".<ref name="Rosenbaum">Rosenbaum, Jonathan, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=95c3YFDncFYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=discovering+orson+welles&hl=en&ei=HOPeS9n_KIWKlwfqm6H7BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Discovering Orson Welles]''.

George Orson Welles was born May 6, 1915, in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]], son of Richard Head Welles (b. Richard Hodgdon Wells, November 12, 1872, near [[St. Joseph, Missouri]]; d.

Despite his family's affluence, Welles encountered hardship in childhood. His parents separated and moved to Chicago in 1919. His father, who made a fortune as the inventor of a popular bicycle lamp,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=203979&apid=119503 |title=Orson Welles Biography |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |access-date=2015-05-09 }}</ref> became an alcoholic and stopped working. Welles's mother, a pianist, played during lectures by Dudley Crafts Watson at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] to support her son and herself; the oldest Welles boy, "Dickie", was institutionalized at an early age because he had learning difficulties.

After his mother's death Welles ceased pursuing music. It was decided that he would spend the summer with the Watson family at a private art colony in [[Wyoming, New York]], established by Lydia Avery Coonley Ward.<ref name="Brady"/>{{Rp|8}} There he played and became friends with the children of the [[Aga Khan III|Aga Khan]], including the 12-year-old [[Prince Aly Khan]]. Then, in what Welles later described as "a hectic period" in his life, he lived in a Chicago apartment with both his father and Dr. Maurice Bernstein, a Chicago physician who had been a close friend of both his parents. Welles briefly attended public school<ref name="Tarbox"/>{{Rp|133}} before his alcoholic father left business altogether and took him along on his travels to Jamaica and the Far East. When they returned they settled in a hotel in [[Grand Detour, Illinois]], that was owned by his father.

"During the three years that Orson lived with his father, some observers wondered who took care of whom", wrote biographer Frank Brady.<ref name="Brady"/>{{Rp|9}}

"In some ways, he was never really a young boy, you know," said Roger Hill, who became Welles's teacher and lifelong friend.<ref name="Leaming"/>{{Rp|24}}

Hill provided Welles with an ''ad hoc'' educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him. Welles performed and staged theatrical experiments and productions there.

"Todd provided Welles with many valuable experiences", wrote critic Richard France. "He was able to explore and experiment in an atmosphere of acceptance and encouragement. In addition to a theater the school's own radio station was at his disposal."<ref name="France"/>{{Rp|27}} Welles's first radio performance was on the Todd station, an adaptation of ''Sherlock Holmes'' that he also wrote.<ref name="Heyer">Heyer, Paul, ''The Medium and the Magician: Orson Welles, the Radio Years 1934–1952''.

==Early career (1931–1935)==
After his father's death, Welles traveled to Europe using a small portion of his inheritance. Welles said that while on a walking and painting trip through Ireland, he strode into the [[Gate Theatre]] in Dublin and claimed he was a Broadway star. The manager of Gate, [[Hilton Edwards]], later said he had not believed him but was impressed by his brashness and an impassioned quality in his audition.<ref>[[Micheál Mac Liammóir|Mac Liammóir, Micheál]], ''All For Hecuba: An Irish Theatrical Biography''.

Ltd., 1946, ISBN 9780828311373</ref>{{Rp|134|date=April 2014}} Welles made his stage debut at the Gate Theatre on October 13, 1931, appearing in [[Ashley Dukes]]'s adaptation of ''[[Jud Süß (Feuchtwanger novel)|Jew Suss]]'' as Duke Karl Alexander of Württemberg. He performed small supporting roles in subsequent Gate productions, and he produced and designed productions of his own in Dublin. In March 1932 Welles performed in [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s ''The Circle'' at Dublin's [[Abbey Theatre]] and travelled to London to find additional work in the theatre. Unable to obtain a work permit, he returned to the U.S.<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|327–330|date=April 2014}}

Welles found his fame ephemeral and turned to a writing project at Todd School that would become the immensely successful, first entitled ''Everybody's Shakespeare'' and subsequently, ''The Mercury Shakespeare''. Welles traveled to North Africa while working on thousands of illustrations for the ''Everybody's Shakespeare'' series of educational books, a series that remained in print for decades.

In 1933, Roger and Hortense Hill invited Welles along to a party in Chicago, where Welles met [[Thornton Wilder]]. Wilder arranged for Welles to meet [[Alexander Woollcott]] in New York, in order that he be introduced to [[Katharine Cornell]], who was assembling a [[repertory theatre]] company.

By 1935 Welles was supplementing his earnings in the theater as a radio actor in [[Manhattan]], working with many actors who would later form the core of his [[Mercury Theatre]] on programs including ''America's Hour'', ''[[Cavalcade of America]]'', ''[[Columbia Workshop]]'' and ''[[The March of Time]]''.<ref name="Welles TIOW" />{{Rp|331–332|date=January 2013}} "Within a year of his debut Welles could claim membership in that elite band of radio actors who commanded salaries second only to the highest paid movie stars," wrote critic [[Richard France (writer)|Richard France]].<ref name="France">[[Richard France (writer)|France, Richard]], ''The Theatre of Orson Welles''.

Part of the [[Works Progress Administration]], the [[Federal Theatre Project]] (1935–39) was a [[New Deal]] program to fund theatre and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the United States during the [[Great Depression]]. It was created as a [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935|relief measure]] to employ artists, writers, directors and theater workers. Under national director [[Hallie Flanagan]] it was shaped into a true national theatre that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and innovation, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time.<ref name="Arena">{{cite book |last=Flanagan |first=Hallie  |authorlink=Hallie Flanagan |date=1965 |title=Arena: The History of the Federal Theatre |url= |location=New York |publisher=Benjamin Blom, reprint edition [1940] |oclc=855945294}}</ref> Within a year the Federal Theatre Project employed 15,000 men and women at just over $20 a week.

Welles joined the Federal Theatre Project and, with John Houseman, he came to run two of its New York City theatres. Far from unemployed — "I was so employed I forgot how to sleep" — Welles put a large share of his $1,500-a-week radio earnings into his stage productions, bypassing administrative red tape and mounting the projects more quickly and professionally. "Roosevelt once said that I was the only operator in history who ever illegally siphoned money ''into'' a Washington project," Welles said.<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|11–13}}

====''The Cradle Will Rock''====
In 1937, Welles rehearsed [[Marc Blitzstein]]'s political operetta, ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''. It was originally scheduled to open June 16, 1937, in its first public preview. Because of severe federal cutbacks in the Works Progress projects, the show's premiere at the [[Maxine Elliott Theatre]] was canceled. The theater was locked and guarded to prevent any government-purchased materials from being used for a commercial production of the work. In a last-minute move, Welles announced to waiting ticket-holders that the show was being transferred to [[New Century Theatre|the Venice]], 20 blocks away. Some cast, and some crew and audience, walked the distance on foot. The union musicians refused to perform in a commercial theater for lower non-union government wages. The actors' union stated that the production belonged to the Federal Theater Project and could not be performed outside that context without permission. Lacking the participation of the union members, ''The Cradle Will Rock'' began with Blitzstein introducing the show and playing the piano accompaniment on stage with some cast members performing from the audience. This impromptu performance was well received by its audience.

[[File:Welles-American-1938.jpg|240px|left|thumb|At age 22 Welles was Broadway's youngest impresario — producing, directing and starring in an adaptation of ''Julius Caesar'' that broke all performance records for the play (1938)]]

===Mercury Theatre===
{{Main|Mercury Theatre}}
Breaking with the [[Federal Theatre Project]] in 1937, Welles and Houseman founded their own repertory company, which they called the Mercury Theatre. The name was inspired by the title of the iconoclastic magazine, ''[[The American Mercury]]''.<ref name="Brady">[[Frank Brady (writer)|Brady, Frank]], ''Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles''. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1989 ISBN 0-684-18982-8</ref>{{Rp|119–120|date=January 2014}}

Welles became executive producer and the repertory company eventually included actors such as [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]], [[George Coulouris]], [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Dolores del Río]], [[Agnes Moorehead]], [[Erskine Sanford]] and [[Everett Sloane]], all of whom worked for Welles for years.

The first Mercury Theatre stage production was a melodramatic edited version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s tragedy ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', set in a contemporary frame of fascist Italy. Cinna, the Poet dies at the hands not of a mob but of a secret police force. According to [[Norman Lloyd (actor)|Norman Lloyd]], who played Cinna the Poet, "it stopped the show."

''Caesar'' opened November 11, 1937, followed by ''[[The Shoemaker's Holiday]]'' (January 11, 1938), ''[[Heartbreak House]]'' (April 29, 1938) and ''[[Danton's Death]]'' (November 5, 1938).<ref name="Bret Wood"/>{{Rp|344|date=January 2014}}

==Radio (1936–1940)==
{{Main|Orson Welles radio credits}}

Simultaneously with his work in the theatre, Welles worked extensively in radio as an actor, writer, director and producer, often without credit.<ref name="Bret Wood"/>{{Rp|77|date=January 2014}} Between 1935 and 1937 he was earning as much as $2,000 a week, shuttling between radio studios at such a pace that he would arrive barely in time for a quick scan of his lines before he was on the air. While he was directing the ''Voodoo Macbeth'' Welles was dashing between Harlem and [[midtown Manhattan]] three times a day to meet his radio commitments.<ref name="France"/>{{Rp|172|date=May 2014}}

"What didn't I do on the radio?" Welles reflected in February 1983:

<blockquote>Radio is what I love most of all. The wonderful excitement of what could happen in live radio, when everything that could go wrong did go wrong. I was making a couple of thousand a week, scampering in ambulances from studio to studio, and committing much of what I made to support the Mercury.

In addition to continuing as a repertory player on ''[[The March of Time]]'', in the fall of 1936 Welles adapted and performed ''[[Hamlet]]'' in an early two-part episode of [[CBS Radio]]'s   ''[[Columbia Workshop]]''. His performance as the announcer in the series' April 1937 presentation of [[Archibald MacLeish]]'s verse drama ''[[The Fall of the City]]'' was an important development in his radio career<ref name="Bret Wood">[[Bret Wood|Wood, Bret]], ''Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography''.

===''The Mercury Theatre on the Air''===
After the theatrical successes of the [[Mercury Theatre]], [[CBS Radio]] invited Orson Welles to create a summer show for 13 weeks. The series began July 11, 1938, initially titled ''First Person Singular'', with the formula that Welles would play the lead in each show. Some months later the show was called ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]''.<ref name="Museum of Broadcasting"/>{{Rp|12}} The weekly hour-long show presented radio plays based on classic literary works, with original music composed and conducted by [[Bernard Herrmann]].

===="The War of the Worlds"====
The Mercury Theatre's [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|radio adaptation of ''The War of the Worlds'']] by [[H. G. Wells]] October 30, 1938, brought Welles instant fame. The combination of the news bulletin form of the performance with the between-breaks dial spinning habits of listeners was later reported to have created widespread confusion among listeners who failed to hear the introduction, although the extent of this confusion has come into question.<ref name="McFarland" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Getting It Wrong: Ten of the Greatest Misreported Stories in American Journalism |last=Campbell |first=W.

Welles's growing fame drew Hollywood offers, lures that the independent-minded Welles resisted at first. ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air,'' which had been a sustaining show (without sponsorship) was picked up by [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell Soup]] and renamed ''[[The Campbell Playhouse]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learnoutloud.com/Catalog/Literature/-/The-Mercury-Theatre-on-the-Air/16905 |title=Learn Out Loud |publisher=Learn Out Loud |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref>

===''The Campbell Playhouse''===
As a direct result of the front-page headlines Orson Welles generated with his 1938 Halloween production ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'', [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]] signed on as sponsor. ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' made its last broadcast on December 4, 1938, and ''The Campbell Playhouse'' began five days later.

Welles began commuting from Hollywood to New York for the two Sunday broadcasts of ''The Campbell Playhouse'' after signing a film contract with [[RKO Pictures]] in August 1939. In November 1939, production of the show moved from New York to Los Angeles.<ref name="Welles TIOW" />{{Rp|353|date=January 2014}}

After 20 shows, Campbell began to exercise more creative control and had complete control over story selection. As his contract with Campbell came to an end, Welles chose not to sign on for another season. After the broadcast of March 31, 1940, Welles and Campbell parted amicably.<ref name="Brady"/>{{Rp|221–226|date=April 2014}}

==Hollywood (1939–1948)==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
[[RKO Radio Pictures]] president [[George Schaefer (film producer)|George Schaefer]] eventually offered Welles what generally is considered the greatest contract offered to an untried director: complete artistic control.

After signing a summary agreement with RKO on July 22, Welles signed a full-length 63-page contract August 21, 1939.<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|353|date=May 2014}}

RKO signed Welles in a two-picture deal; including script, cast, crew and most importantly, final cut, although Welles had a budget limit for his projects. With this contract in hand, Welles (and nearly the whole Mercury Theatre troupe) moved to Hollywood.

Welles toyed with various ideas for his first project for [[RKO Radio Pictures]], settling on an adaptation of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', which he worked on in detail. He planned to film the action with a [[Point of view shot|subjective camera]] (a technique later used in the [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] film ''[[Lady in the Lake]]''). When a budget was drawn up, RKO's enthusiasm cooled because it was greater than the agreed limit.

Welles's first experience on a Hollywood film was narrator for RKO's 1940 production of ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1940 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=4523 |title=Swiss Family Robinson  |publisher=AFI Catalog of Feature Films |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}</ref>

===''Citizen Kane''===

====Production====
[[File:Orson Welles-Citizen Kane1.jpg|thumb|Orson Welles in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941)]]

RKO, having rejected Welles's first two movie proposals, agreed on the third offer, ''Citizen Kane,'' which Welles co-wrote, produced and directed, also performing the lead role.<ref name="autogenerated2001">McMahon, Thomas, "Orson Welles", ''Authors & Artists for Young Adults: Vol. 40''. Michigan: Gale Research, 2001 ISBN 0787646733</ref>

Welles found a suitable film project in an idea he conceived with screenwriter [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]], then writing radio plays for ''The Campbell Playhouse''.<ref name="Carringer 1985">{{cite book |title=The Making of Citizen Kane |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=WEJDyUCS3S4C&lpg=PA16&ots=sl1f_P7lge&dq=Mankiewicz%20The%20Campbell%20Playhouse&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q=Mankiewicz%20The%20Campbell%20Playhouse&f=false |last=Carringer |first=Robert L. |publisher=University of California Press, |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles California |year=1985 |ISBN=0-520-20567-7 |accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>{{Rp|16}} Initially titled ''American'', it eventually became Welles's first feature film (his most famous and honored role), ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941).

Mankiewicz based the original outline on an ''exposé'' of the life of [[William Randolph Hearst]], whom he knew socially and came to hate, having once been great friends with Hearst's mistress, [[Marion Davies]].

Supplying Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes, Welles urged him to write the first draft screenplay under [[John Houseman]], who was posted to ensure Mankiewicz stayed sober. On Welles's instruction, Houseman wrote the opening narration as a pastiche of ''[[The March of Time]]'' newsreels. Orson Welles explained to [[Peter Bogdanovich]] about the writers working separately by saying, "I left him on his own finally, because we'd started to waste too much time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine."<ref name="Welles TIOW" />{{Rp|54|date=May 2012}} Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, "At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own."<ref name="Welles TIOW" />{{Rp|54|date=May 2012}}

Charles Foster Kane is based loosely on areas of Hearst's life. Nonetheless, autobiographical allusions to Welles were worked in, most noticeably in the treatment of Kane's childhood and particularly, regarding his guardianship. Welles added features from other famous American lives to create a general and mysterious personality, rather than the narrow journalistic portrait drawn by Mankiewicz, whose first drafts included scandalous claims about the death of film director [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]].

Once the script was complete, Welles attracted some of Hollywood's best technicians, including cinematographer [[Gregg Toland]], who walked into Welles's office and announced he wanted to work on the picture. Welles described Toland as "the fastest cameraman who ever lived."<ref name="autogenerated2001" /> For the cast, Welles primarily used actors from his Mercury Theatre. He invited suggestions from everyone but only if they were directed through him. Filming ''Citizen Kane'' took ten weeks.<ref name="autogenerated2001" />

====Reaction====
Mankiewicz handed a copy of the shooting script to his friend, [[Charles Lederer]], husband of Welles's ex-wife, Virginia Nicolson, and the nephew of Hearst's mistress, Marion Davies. Gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] saw a small ad in a newspaper for a preview screening of ''Citizen Kane'' and went. Hopper realized immediately that the film was based on features of Hearst's life.<!-- this last seems incomplete or garbled --> Thus began a struggle, the attempted suppression of ''Citizen Kane''.

Hearst's media outlets boycotted the film. They exerted enormous pressure on the Hollywood film community by threatening to expose fifteen years of suppressed scandals and the fact that most studio bosses were Jewish. At one point, heads of the major studios jointly offered RKO the cost of the film in exchange for the negative and existing prints, fully intending to burn them. RKO declined, and the film was given a limited release. Hearst intimidated theater chains by threatening to ban advertising for their other films in his papers if they showed ''Citizen Kane''.

The film was well-received critically, with Bosley Crowther, film critic for the ''New York Times'' calling it "close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood".<ref name="Bosley Crowther">{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=3&res=9E00E3D6173AE33BBC4A53DFB366838A659EDE |title=Orson Welles's Controversial 'Citizen Kane' Proves a Sensational Film at Palace|work=New York Times|date=May 2, 1941|author=Crowther, Bosley|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref> By the time it reached the general public, the publicity had waned. It garnered nine Academy Award nominations (Orson nominated as a [[Academy Award for Best Picture|producer]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|director]], [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)|writer]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|actor]]), but won only for Best Original Screenplay, shared by Mankiewicz and Welles. Although it was largely ignored at the Academy Awards, ''Citizen Kane'' is now hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. [[Andrew Sarris]] called it "the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''."<ref name="autogenerated2001" />

The delay in its release and uneven distribution contributed to mediocre results at the box office; it earned back its budget and marketing, but RKO lost any chance of a major profit. The fact that ''Citizen Kane'' ignored many Hollywood conventions meant that the film confused and angered the 1940s cinema public. Exhibitor response was scathing; most theater owners complained bitterly about the adverse audience reaction and the many walkouts. Only a few saw fit to acknowledge Welles's artistic technique. RKO shelved the film and did not re-release it until 1956.

During the 1950s, the film came to be seen by young French film critics such as [[François Truffaut]] as exemplifying the "[[auteur theory]]", in which the director is the "author" of a film. Truffaut, [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]] and others inspired by Welles's example made their own films, giving birth to the [[Nouvelle Vague]]. In the 1960s ''Citizen Kane'' became popular on college campuses as a film-study exercise and as an entertainment subject. Its revivals on television, home video and DVD have enhanced its "classic" status and ultimately recouped costs. The film is considered by most film critics and historians to be one of, if not the, greatest motion pictures in cinema history.

===''The Magnificent Ambersons''===
Welles's second film for RKO was ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', adapted from the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Magnificent Ambersons|novel]] by [[Booth Tarkington]]. George Schaefer hoped to make money with this film, since he lost money with ''Citizen Kane''. ''Ambersons'' had been adapted for ''[[The Campbell Playhouse]]'' by Welles, for radio, and Welles then wrote the screen adaptation. Toland was not available, so [[Stanley Cortez]] was named cinematographer. The meticulous Cortez worked slowly and the film lagged behind schedule and over budget. Prior to production, Welles's contract was renegotiated, revoking his right to control the final cut.

''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was in production October 28, 1941 – January 22, 1942.<ref name="AFI Ambersons">{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=27328 |title=The Magnificent Ambersons |publisher=''[[The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures]]'' |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> Throughout the shooting of the film Welles was also producing a weekly half-hour radio series, ''[[Orson Welles Show (radio)|The Orson Welles Show]]''.

In addition to acting in the film, Welles was the producer. Direction was credited to [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]].

The mission of the OCIAA was [[cultural diplomacy]], promoting [[Pan-Americanism|hemispheric solidarity]] and countering the growing [[Latin America during World War II#Axis activity|influence of the Axis powers in Latin America]]. The OCIAA's Motion Picture Division played an important role in documenting history and shaping opinion toward the [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]], particularly after the U.S. entered World War II in December 1941. To support the war effort — and for their own audience development throughout Latin America — Hollywood studios partnered with the U.S. government on a nonprofit basis, making films and incorporating Latin American stars and content into their commercial releases.<ref name="Benamou"/>{{Rp|10–11}}

Artists working in a variety of disciplines were sent to Latin America as goodwill ambassadors by the OCIAA, most on tours of two to four months. A select listing includes [[Misha Reznikoff]] and photojournalist Genevieve Naylor (October 1940–May 1943); [[Bing Crosby]] (August–October 1941); [[Walt Disney]] (August–October 1941); [[Aaron Copland]] (August–December 1941); [[George Balanchine]] and the [[American Ballet]] (1941); [[Rita Hayworth]] (1942); [[Grace Moore]] (1943); [[John Ford]] (1943) and [[Gregg Toland]] (1943). Welles was thoroughly briefed in Washington, D.C., immediately before his departure for Brazil, and film scholar Catherine L. Benamou, a specialist in Latin American affairs, finds it "not unlikely" that he was among the goodwill ambassadors who were asked to gather intelligence for the U.S. government in addition to their cultural duties. She concludes that Welles's acceptance of Whitney's request was "a logical and patently patriotic choice".<ref name="Benamou"/>{{Rp|245–247}}

In addition to working on his ill-fated film project, ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'', Welles was responsible for radio programs, lectures, interviews and informal talks as part of his OCIAA-sponsored cultural mission, which was a success.<ref name="Wilson">Wilson, Richard, "It's Not ''Quite'' All True".

Right here I'd like to make it a matter of record," Wilson continued:

<blockquote>Both RKO and Welles got into the project by trying to do their bit for the war effort. However: RKO, as a company responsible to stockholders, negotiated a private and tough agreement for the U.S. Government to pay it 300,000 dollars to undertake its bit. This speaks eloquently enough for its evaluation of the project as a non-commercial venture. I personally think that Orson's waiving any payment whatever for his work, and his giving up a lucrative weekly radio program, is even more eloquent. For a well-paid creative artist to work for over half a year for no remuneration is a most uncommon occurrence.<ref name="Wilson"/>{{Rp|189}}</blockquote>

Welles's own expectations for the film were modest, as he told biographer Barbara Leaming: "''It's All True'' was not going to make any cinematic history, nor was it intended to. It was intended to be a perfectly honorable execution of my job as a goodwill ambassador, bringing entertainment to the Northern Hemisphere that showed them something about the Southern one."<ref name="Leaming"/>{{Rp|253}}

Required to film the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro in early February 1942, Welles rushed to edit ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' and finish his acting scenes in ''Journey into Fear''. He ended his [[Orson Welles Show (radio)|CBS radio show]] February 2, flew to Washington, D.C., for a briefing, and then lashed together a rough cut of ''Ambersons'' in Miami with editor [[Robert Wise]].<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|369–370}} Welles recorded the film's narration the night before he left for South America: "I went to the projection room at about four in the morning, did the whole thing, and then got on the plane and off to Rio — and the end of civilization as we know it."<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|115}}

Welles left for Brazil on February 4 and began filming in Rio February 8.<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|369–370}}

"Welles's diplomatic appointment did not appear at first to disrupt the continuity of either ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' or the ''It's All True'' projects," wrote Catherine L. Benamou:

<blockquote>Robert Wise planned to fly down to Rio to work with Welles on the final edit of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'', and although it would necessarily undergo a shift in geocultural emphasis, ''It's All True'' would retain its basic division into four episodes, along with its narrative foundation in historical experience. … In the very short run, however, the ambassadorial appointment would be the first in a series of turning points leading — in "zigs" and "zags," rather than in a straight line — to Welles's loss of complete directorial control over both ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' and ''It's All True'', the cancellation of his contract at RKO Radio Studio, the expulsion of his company Mercury Productions from the RKO lot, and, ultimately, the total suspension of ''It's All True''.<ref name="Benamou"/>{{Rp|46}}</blockquote>

As a result of difficult financial circumstances at RKO in 1940–42, major changes occurred at the studio in 1942. [[Floyd Odlum]] and the [[Atlas Corporation]] took control of RKO and began changing its direction. Nelson Rockefeller, the most significant backer of the Brazil project, left the RKO board of directors. Around that time, the principal sponsor of Welles at RKO, studio president George Schaefer, resigned. The changes throughout RKO caused reevaluations of projects. RKO took control of ''Ambersons'' and edited the film into what the studio considered a commercial format. Welles's attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.<ref name="AFI Ambersons"/><ref>Barnett, Vincent L. "Cutting Koerners: Floyd Odlum, the Atlas Corporation and the Dismissal of Orson Welles from RKO". ''Film History: An International Journal'', Volume 22, Number 2, 2010, pp.182–198.</ref>

In South America, Welles requested resources to finish ''It's All True''. He was given a limited amount of black-and-white film stock and a silent camera. He finished shooting the episode about the jangadeiros, but RKO refused to support further production on the film.

"So I was fired from RKO," Welles told BBC interviewer Leslie Megahey (''The Orson Welles Story'') in 1982:

<blockquote>And they made a great publicity point of the fact that I had gone to South America without a script and thrown all this money away. I never recovered from that attack. … RKO had its stationery that year, its official stationery, RKO Pictures and its slogan for that year. Printed on every piece of paper that went out from RKO was "Showmanship Instead of Genius". In other words, the reason you should buy an RKO picture was that you didn't get Orson Welles.<ref name="Estrin"/>{{Rp|188}}</blockquote>

On October 12, 1942, ''[[Cavalcade of America]]'' presented Welles's radio play, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea'', an entertaining and factual look at the legend of Christopher Columbus.

"It belongs to a period when hemispheric unity was a crucial matter and many programs were being devoted to the common heritage of the Americas," wrote broadcasting historian [[Erik Barnouw]]. "Many such programs were being translated into Spanish and Portuguese and broadcast to Latin America, to counteract many years of successful Axis propaganda to that area.

''[[Hello Americans]]'', a CBS Radio series broadcast November 15, 1942 – January 31, 1943, was produced, directed and hosted by Welles under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator for Inter-American Affairs. The 30-minute weekly program promoted inter-American understanding and friendship, drawing upon the research amassed for the ill-fated film, ''It's All True''.<ref>Hickerson, Jay, ''The Ultimate History of Network Radio Programming and Guide to All Circulating Shows''. Hamden, Connecticut, second edition December 1992, page 303</ref> The series was produced concurrently with Welles's other CBS series, ''[[Ceiling Unlimited]]'' (November 9, 1942 – February 1, 1943), sponsored by the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]-[[Vega Aircraft Corporation|Vega]] Corporation. The program was conceived to glorify the aviation industry and dramatize its role in [[World War II]].

"Welles wrote, produced, and narrated this show, and his work was considered a prime contribution to the war effort," wrote the [[Paley Center for Media|Museum of Broadcasting]].<ref name="Museum of Broadcasting"/>{{Rp|64}}

Throughout the war Welles worked on patriotic radio programs including ''[[Command Performance (radio)|Command Performance]]'', ''G.I. Journal'', ''[[Mail Call (radio program)|Mail Call]]'', ''Nazi Eyes on Canada'', ''Stage Door Canteen'' and ''Treasury Star Parade''.

====''The Mercury Wonder Show''====
In early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (''[[Ceiling Unlimited]]'', ''[[Hello Americans]]'') that Orson Welles created for [[CBS Radio|CBS]] to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on the 1943 film adaptation of ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part [[circus]] and part [[magic (illusion)|magic show]]. He offered his services as magician and director,<ref name="Magic">Charvet, David, "Orson Welles and The Mercury Wonder Show".

The development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles's oft-changing [[Selective Service System|draft status]] in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F — unfit for military service — for a variety of medical reasons.

[[File:Orson-Welles-1945.jpg|thumb|220px|Director and star Orson Welles at work on ''[[The Stranger (1946 film)|The Stranger]]'' (October 1945)]]

In the fall of 1945 Welles began work on ''[[The Stranger (1946 film)|The Stranger]]'' (1946), a [[film noir]] drama about a war crimes investigator who tracks a high-ranking Nazi fugitive to an idyllic New England town. [[Edward G.

Within weeks of the completion of the film, International Pictures backed out of its promised four-picture deal with Welles. No reason was given, but the impression was left that ''The Stranger'' would not make money.<ref name="Brady"/>{{Rp|381}}

====''Around the World''====
In the summer of 1946, Welles directed ''[[Around the World (musical)|Around the World]]'', a musical stage adaptation of the [[Jules Verne]] novel ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' with the book by Welles and music by [[Cole Porter]]. Producer [[Mike Todd]], who would later produce the successful [[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|1956 film adaptation]], pulled out from the lavish and expensive Broadway production, leaving Welles to support the finances. When Welles ran out of money he convinced [[Columbia Pictures]] president [[Harry Cohn]] to send enough money to continue the show, and in exchange Welles promised to write, produce, direct and star in a film for Cohn for no further fee. The stage show soon failed due to poor box-office, with Welles unable to claim the losses on his taxes.

====Radio series====
In 1946, Welles began two new radio series — ''[[The Mercury Summer Theatre on the Air]]'' for CBS, and ''[[Orson Welles Commentaries]]'' for ABC. While ''Mercury Summer Theatre'' featured half-hour adaptations of some classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s, the first episode was a condensation of his ''Around the World'' stage play, and is the only record of Cole Porter's music for the project. Several original Mercury actors returned for the series, as well as Bernard Herrmann. It was only scheduled for the summer months, and Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play. ''Commentaries'' was a political vehicle for him, continuing the themes from his ''New York Post'' column. Again, Welles lacked a clear focus, until the [[NAACP]] brought to his attention the case of [[Isaac Woodard]]. Welles brought significant attention to Woodard's cause.

====''The Lady from Shanghai''====
The film that Welles was obliged to make in exchange for Harry Cohn's help in financing the stage production ''[[Around the World (musical)|Around the World]]'' was ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'', filmed in 1947 for [[Columbia Pictures]]. Intended as a modest thriller, the budget skyrocketed after Cohn suggested that Welles's then-estranged second wife Rita Hayworth co-star.
[[File:Lady from Shanghai trailer welles.JPG|thumb|220px|left|Orson Welles in ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'' (1947)]]
Cohn disliked Welles's rough-cut, particularly the confusing plot and lack of close-ups, and was not in sympathy with Welles's [[Brechtian]] use of irony and [[black comedy]], especially in a farcical courtroom scene. Cohn ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut was removed, including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was appalled particularly with the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors has since become a touchstone of [[film noir]]. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce.

Although ''The Lady From Shanghai'' was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced in the U.S. until decades later. A similar difference in reception on opposite sides of the Atlantic followed by greater American acceptance befell the Welles-inspired Chaplin film ''Monsieur Verdoux'', originally to be directed by Welles starring Chaplin, then directed by Chaplin with the idea credited to Welles.

====''Macbeth''====
Prior to 1948, Welles convinced [[Republic Pictures]] to let him direct a low-budget version of ''[[Macbeth (1948 film)|Macbeth]]'', which featured highly stylized sets and costumes, and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a pre-recorded soundtrack, one of many innovative cost-cutting techniques Welles deployed in an attempt to make an epic film from [[B-movie]] resources. The script, adapted by Welles, is a violent reworking of Shakespeare's original, freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a [[collage]] technique and recasting ''Macbeth'' as a clash of pagan and proto-Christian ideologies. Some voodoo trappings of the famous Welles/Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are visible, especially in the film's characterization of the [[Weird Sisters]], who create an effigy of Macbeth as a charm to enchant him. Of all Welles's post-''Kane'' Hollywood productions, ''Macbeth'' is stylistically closest to ''Citizen Kane'' in its long takes and deep focus photography.

Republic initially trumpeted the film as an important work but decided it did not care for the Scottish accents and held up general release for almost a year after early negative press reaction, including ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'''s comment that Welles's film "doth foully slaughter Shakespeare."<ref>{{cite web|title=Orson Welles doth foully slaughter Shakespeare in a dialect version of his "Tragedy of Macbeth" — or so sayeth LIFE magazine|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=729|work=Wellesnet|accessdate=September 1, 2011}}</ref> Welles left for Europe, while co-producer and lifelong supporter [[Richard Wilson (producer)|Richard Wilson]] reworked the soundtrack. Welles returned and cut 20 minutes from the film at Republic's request and recorded narration to cover some gaps. The film was decried as a disaster. ''Macbeth'' had influential fans in Europe, especially the French poet and filmmaker [[Jean Cocteau]], who hailed the film's "crude, irreverent power" and careful shot design, and described the characters as haunting "the corridors of some dreamlike subway, an abandoned coal mine, and ruined cellars oozing with water."<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Tony|title=Macbeth|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2006/cteq/macbeth-2/|work=[[Senses of Cinema]]|accessdate=September 1, 2011}}</ref>

==Europe (1948–1956)==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
In Italy he starred as [[Cagliostro]] in the 1948 film ''[[Black Magic (1949 film)|Black Magic]]''. His co-star, [[Akim Tamiroff]], impressed Welles so much that Tamiroff would appear in four of Welles's productions during the 1950s and 1960s.

The following year, Welles starred as [[Harry Lime]] in [[Carol Reed]]'s ''[[The Third Man]]'', alongside [[Joseph Cotten]], his friend and co-star from ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', with a script by [[Graham Greene]] and a memorable score by [[Anton Karas]].

A few years later, British radio producer [[Harry Alan Towers]] would resurrect the Lime character in the radio series ''[[The Adventures of Harry Lime]]''.

Welles appeared as [[Cesare Borgia]] in the 1949 Italian film ''[[Prince of Foxes (film)|Prince of Foxes]]'', with [[Tyrone Power]] and Mercury Theatre alumnus [[Everett Sloane]], and as the Mongol warrior Bayan in the 1950 film version of the novel ''[[The Black Rose]]'' (again with Tyrone Power).
<ref>Carol Reed biography</ref>

===''Othello''===
During this time, Welles was channeling his money from acting jobs into a self-financed film version of Shakespeare's play ''[[Othello]]''. From 1949 to 1951, Welles worked on ''[[Othello (1952 film)|Othello]]'', filming on location in Europe and [[Morocco]]. The film featured Welles's friends, [[Micheál Mac Liammóir]] as [[Iago]] and [[Hilton Edwards]] as [[Desdemona (Othello)|Desdemona]]'s father [[Brabantio]]. [[Suzanne Cloutier]] starred as Desdemona and [[Campbell Playhouse]] alumnus [[Robert Coote]] appeared as Iago's associate Roderigo.

Filming was suspended several times as Welles ran out of funds and left for acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiammóir's published memoir ''Put Money in Thy Purse''. The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a drop-out of sound at every quiet moment. Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith, restored ''Othello'' in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing [[Angelo Francesco Lavagnino]]'s original musical score, which was originally inaudible, and adding ambient stereo sound effects, which were not in the original film. The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America.

In 1952, Welles continued finding work in England after the success of the ''Harry Lime'' radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, ''[[The Black Museum]]'', which ran for 52 weeks with Welles as host and narrator. Director Herbert Wilcox offered Welles the part of the murdered victim in ''[[Trent's Last Case (1952 film)|Trent's Last Case]]'', based on the novel by [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|E. C. Bentley]]. In 1953, the [[BBC]] hired Welles to read an hour of selections from [[Walt Whitman]]'s epic poem ''[[Song of Myself]]''. Towers hired Welles again, to play [[Professor Moriarty]] in the radio series, ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'', starring [[John Gielgud]] and [[Ralph Richardson]].

Welles briefly returned to America to make his first appearance on television, starring in the ''[[Omnibus (US TV series)|Omnibus]]'' presentation of ''[[King Lear (1953 TV drama)|King Lear]]'', broadcast live on [[CBS]] October 18, 1953. Directed by [[Peter Brook]], the production costarred [[Natasha Parry]], [[Beatrice Straight]] and [[Arnold Moss]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0664918/ ''King Lear''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]; [http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/40866/king-lear/ DVD Talk review] February 9, 2010 (Retrieved December 29, 2011)</ref>

In 1954, director George More O'Ferrall offered Welles the title role in the 'Lord Mountdrago' segment of ''[[Three Cases of Murder]]'', co-starring [[Alan Badel]]. [[Herbert Wilcox]] cast Welles as the antagonist in ''[[Trouble in the Glen]]'' opposite [[Margaret Lockwood]], [[Forrest Tucker]] and [[Victor McLaglen]]. Old friend [[John Huston]] cast him as Father Mapple in his [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|1956 film adaptation]] of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', starring [[Gregory Peck]].

===''Mr. Arkadin''===
[[File:Orson Welles.jpg|thumbnail|right|Welles in Madrid during the filming of ''Mr. Arkadin'' in 1954]]
Welles's next turn as director was the film ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]'' (1955), which was produced by his political mentor from the 1940s, Louis Dolivet. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars [[Robert Arden]], who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, [[Paola Mori]], whose voice was dubbed by actress [[Billie Whitelaw]]; and guest stars [[Akim Tamiroff]], [[Michael Redgrave]], [[Katina Paxinou]] and [[Mischa Auer]]. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled ''Confidential Report''. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the [[Munich Stadtmuseum|Munich Film Museum]] oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.

In 1955, Welles also directed two television series for the BBC. The first was ''[[Orson Welles' Sketch Book]]'', a series of six 15-minute shows featuring Welles drawing in a sketchbook to illustrate his reminiscences for the camera (including such topics as the filming of ''It's All True'' and the Isaac Woodard case), and the second was ''[[Around the World with Orson Welles]]'', a series of six travelogues set in different locations around Europe (such as [[Venice]], the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] between France and Spain, and England). Welles served as host and interviewer, his commentary including documentary facts and his own personal observations (a technique he would continue to explore in later works).

In 1956, Welles completed ''[[Portrait of Gina]]''. The film cans would remain in a lost-and-found locker at the hotel for several decades, where they were discovered after Welles's death.

==Return to Hollywood (1956–1959)==
[[File:Lucille Ball Orson Welles I Love Lucy 1956.jpg|thumb|left|Welles the magician with Lucille Ball in ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' (October 15, 1956)]]
In 1956, Welles returned to Hollywood.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

He began filming a projected pilot for [[Desilu]], owned by [[Lucille Ball]] and her husband [[Desi Arnaz]], who had recently purchased the former RKO studios. The film was ''[[The Fountain of Youth (film)|The Fountain of Youth]]'', based on a story by [[John Collier (writer)|John Collier]]. Originally deemed not viable as a pilot, the film was not aired until 1958 — and won the [[Peabody Award]] for excellence.

Welles guest starred on television shows including ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Comedy/Lucy1_ILoveLucy_06_%281956-57%29.htm |title=I Love Lucy (1956–57), 'Lucy Meets Orson Welles' |publisher=The Classic TV Archive |date=  |accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref> On radio, he was narrator of ''Tomorrow'' (October 17, 1956), a nuclear holocaust drama produced and syndicated by ABC and the [[Federal Civil Defense Administration]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=Tomorrow |title=Tomorrow  |publisher=RadioGOLDINdex |accessdate=2014-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/otr_civildefensewithorsonwelles |title=Tomorrow  |publisher=Internet Archive |accessdate=2014-09-03}}</ref>

Welles's next feature film role was in ''[[Man in the Shadow]]'' for [[Universal Pictures]] in 1957, starring [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]].

===''Touch of Evil''===
[[File:Touch of Evil-Orson Welles.JPG|thumb|Welles as corrupt police captain Hank Quinlan in ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958)]]
Welles stayed on at Universal to direct (and co-star with) [[Charlton Heston]] in the 1958 film ''[[Touch of Evil]]'', based on [[Whit Masterson]]'s novel ''[[Badge of Evil]]''. Originally only hired as an actor, Welles was promoted to director by [[Universal Studios]] at the insistence of Charlton Heston.<ref name="Heston">[[Charlton Heston|Heston, Charlton]], ''In the Arena: An Autobiography''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995, ISBN 9780684803944</ref>{{Rp|154|date=April 2014}} The film reunited many actors and technicians with whom Welles had worked in Hollywood in the 1940s, including cameraman [[Russell Metty]] (''The Stranger''), makeup artist Maurice Seiderman (''Citizen Kane''), and actors [[Joseph Cotten]], [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Akim Tamiroff]]. Filming proceeded smoothly, with Welles finishing on schedule and on budget, and the studio bosses praising the daily rushes. Nevertheless, after the end of production, the studio re-edited the film, re-shot scenes, and shot new exposition scenes to clarify the plot.<ref name="Heston"/>{{Rp|175–176|date=April 2014}} Welles wrote a 58-page memo outlining suggestions and objections, stating that the film was no longer his version—it was the studio's, but as such, he was still prepared to help with it.<ref name="Heston"/>{{Rp|175–176|date=April 2014}}

In 1978, a longer preview version of the film was discovered and released.

As Universal reworked ''Touch of Evil'', Welles began filming his adaptation of [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'' in Mexico, starring [[Mischa Auer]] as Quixote and Akim Tamiroff as [[Sancho Panza]].

==Return to Europe (1959–1970)==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
[[File:Orson Welles - 1960.jpg|thumb|left|In ''[[Crack in the Mirror]]'' (1960)]]
He continued shooting ''Don Quixote'' in Spain and Italy, but replaced Mischa Auer with Francisco Reiguera, and resumed acting jobs.
In Italy in 1959, Welles directed his own scenes as [[King Saul]] in Richard Pottier's film ''David and Goliath''. In Hong Kong he co-starred with [[Curt Jürgens]] in [[Lewis Gilbert]]'s film ''[[Ferry to Hong Kong]]''. In 1960, in Paris he co-starred in [[Richard Fleischer]]'s film ''[[Crack in the Mirror]]''. In [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] he starred in [[Richard Thorpe]]'s film ''The Tartars'' and [[Veljko Bulajić]]'s "[[Battle of Neretva]]".

Throughout the 1960s, filming continued on ''Quixote'' on-and-off until the decade, as Welles evolved the concept, tone and ending several times. Although he had a complete version of the film shot and edited at least once, he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1980s, he never completed a version film he was fully satisfied with, and would junk existing footage and shoot new footage. (In one case, he had a complete cut ready in which Quixote and Sancho Panza end up going to the moon, but he felt the ending was rendered obsolete by the 1969 moon landings, and burned 10 reels of this version.) As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director [[Jesús Franco]] constructed a film out of the portions of ''Quixote'' left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.

[[File:Orson Welles, 1960.jpg|thumbnail|Welles being interviewed in 1960]]
In 1961, Welles directed ''In the Land of Don Quixote'', a series of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network [[RAI]]. Similar to the ''Around the World with Orson Welles'' series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles's wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network was not interested in him providing Italian narration because of his accent, and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.

===''The Trial''===
In 1962, Welles directed his adaptation of ''[[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]'', based on [[The Trial|the novel]] by [[Franz Kafka]] and produced by [[Alexander Salkind]] and [[Michael Salkind]]. The cast included [[Anthony Perkins]] as Josef K, [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Romy Schneider]], [[Paola Mori]] and [[Akim Tamiroff]]. While filming exteriors in [[Zagreb]], Welles was informed that the Salkinds had run out of money, meaning that there could be no set construction. No stranger to shooting on found locations, Welles soon filmed the interiors in the [[Gare d'Orsay]], at that time an abandoned railway station in Paris. Welles thought the location possessed a "[[Jules Verne]] modernism" and a melancholy sense of "waiting", both suitable for Kafka.To remain in the spirit of Kafka Welles set up the cutting room together with the Film Editor, Frederick Muller (as Fritz Muller), in the old un-used, cold, depressing, station master office. The film failed at the box-office. [[Peter Bogdanovich]] would later observe that Welles found the film riotously funny. During the filming, Welles met [[Oja Kodar]], who would later become his muse, star and mistress for the last twenty years of his life. Welles also stated in an interview with the BBC that it was his best film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/trial%20bbc%20interview.htm |title=Welles BBC interview |publisher=Wellesnet.com |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref>

Welles played a film director in ''[[La Ricotta]]'' (1963)—[[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s segment of the ''[[Ro.Go.Pa.G.]]'' movie, although his renowned voice was dubbed by Italian writer Giorgio Bassani.<ref name="Welles TIOW" />{{Rp|516|date=May 2012}} He continued taking what work he could find acting, narrating or hosting other people's work, and began filming ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'', which was completed in 1966. Filmed in Spain, it was a condensation of five Shakespeare plays, telling the story of [[Falstaff]] and his relationship with Prince Hal. The cast included [[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Fernando Rey]] and [[Margaret Rutherford]], with narration by [[Ralph Richardson]]. Music was again by [[Angelo Francesco Lavagnino]]. [[Jesùs Franco]] served as second unit director. The film was edited by Frederick Muller (as Fritz Muller) who had already worked with Welles editing The Trial.

===''Chimes at Midnight''===
[[File:LeeandOrson.jpg|thumbnail|Welles during the production of the stage version of Chimes at Midnight in 1960]]
''Chimes at Midnight'' was based on Welles's play ''[[Chimes at Midnight#Five Kings (1939)|Five Kings]]'' which condensed five of Shakespeare's plays into one show in order to focus on the story of [[Falstaff]]. Welles produced the show in New York in 1939 but the opening night, where part 1 was acted, was a disaster and part 2 was never put on. He revamped the show and revisited it in 1960 at the [[Gate Theatre]] in Dublin. But again, it was not successful. However, this later production was used as the base for the movie. The script contained text from five plays: primarily ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', but also ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''. [[Keith Baxter (actor)|Keith Baxter]] played Prince Hal, and internationally respected Shakespearean interpreter, [[John Gielgud]], played the King, Henry IV. The film's narration, spoken by [[Ralph Richardson]], is taken from the chronicler [[Raphael Holinshed]]. According to [[Jeanne Moreau]], Welles delayed filming for two weeks due to stage fright. Welles held this film in high regard and considered it, along with ''[[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]'', his best work. As he remarked in 1982, "If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I'd offer up."<ref>{{YouTube|KPmj7j7P0sk|''Arena — The Orson Welles Story''}} BBC, 1982, 2:12:19–26. Retrieved 2014-04-27.</ref>

In 1966, Welles directed a film for French television, an adaptation of ''[[The Immortal Story]]'', by [[Karen Blixen]]. Released in 1968, it stars Jeanne Moreau, [[Roger Coggio]] and [[Norman Eshley]]. The film had a successful run in French theaters. At this time Welles met [[Oja Kodar]] again, and gave her a letter he had written to her and had been keeping for four years; they would not be parted again. They immediately began a collaboration both personal and professional. The first of these was an adaptation of Blixen's ''The Heroine'', meant to be a companion piece to ''The Immortal Story'' and starring Kodar. Unfortunately, funding disappeared after one day's shooting. After completing this film, he appeared in a brief cameo as [[Cardinal Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] in [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s adaptation of ''[[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|A Man for All Seasons]]''—a role for which he won considerable acclaim.

[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Sergei Bondarchuk and Orson Welles, Sarajevo, 29. november 1969. Movie premier Battle of Neretva.JPG|thumb|[[Sergei Bondarchuk]] and Orson Welles at the premiere of ''[[The Battle of Neretva]]'' in [[Sarajevo]] (November 1969)]]
In 1967, Welles began directing ''[[The Deep (1970 film)|The Deep]]'', based on the novel ''[[Dead Calm]]'' by [[Charles Williams (U.S. author)|Charles Williams]] and filmed off the shore of [[Yugoslavia]]. The cast included Jeanne Moreau, [[Laurence Harvey]] and Kodar. Personally financed by Welles and Kodar, they could not obtain the funds to complete the project, and it was abandoned a few years later after the death of Harvey. The surviving footage was eventually edited and released by the Filmmuseum München. In 1968 Welles began filming a TV special for CBS under the title ''Orson's Bag'', combining travelogue, comedy skits and a condensation of Shakespeare's play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' with Welles as [[Shylock]]. In 1969 Welles called again the Film Editor Frederick Muller to work with him re-editing the material and they set up cutting rooms at the Safa Palatino Studios in Rome.  Funding for the show sent by CBS to Welles in Switzerland was seized by the IRS. Without funding, the show was not completed. The surviving [[The Merchant of Venice (unfinished film)|film]] clips portions were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.

In 1969, Welles authorized the use of his name for a cinema in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts. The [[Orson Welles Cinema]] remained in operation until 1986, with Welles making a personal appearance there in 1977. Also in 1969 he played a supporting role in [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Kremlin Letter]]''. Drawn by the numerous offers he received to work in television and films, and upset by a tabloid scandal reporting his affair with Kodar, Welles abandoned the editing of ''Don Quixote'' and moved back to America in 1970.

==Later career (1970–1985)==

Welles returned to Hollywood, where he continued to self-finance his film and television projects. While offers to act, narrate and host continued, Welles also found himself in great demand on television talk shows. He made frequent appearances for [[The Dick Cavett Show|Dick Cavett]], [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Johnny Carson]], [[The Dean Martin Show|Dean Martin]] and [[The Merv Griffin Show|Merv Griffin]].

Welles's primary focus during his final years was ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]'', an unfinished project that was filmed intermittently between 1970 and 1976. Written by Welles, it is the story of an aging film director ([[John Huston]]) looking for funds to complete his final film. The cast includes [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Susan Strasberg]], [[Norman Foster (director)|Norman Foster]], [[Edmond O'Brien]], [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] and [[Dennis Hopper]]. Financed by Iranian backers, ownership of the film fell into a legal quagmire after the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] was deposed. While there have been several reports of all the legal disputes concerning ownership of the film being settled, enough disputes still exist to prevent its release.

Welles portrayed [[Louis XVIII of France]] in the 1970 film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'', and narrated the beginning and ending scenes of the historical comedy ''[[Start the Revolution Without Me]]'' (1970).

In 1971, Welles directed a short adaptation of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', a one-man performance on a bare stage, reminiscent of his 1955 stage production ''[[Moby Dick—Rehearsed]]''. Never completed, it was eventually released by the Filmmuseum München. He also appeared in ''[[Ten Days' Wonder (film)|Ten Days' Wonder]]'', co-starring with [[Anthony Perkins]] and directed by [[Claude Chabrol]], based on a detective novel by [[Ellery Queen]]. That same year, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] gave him an honorary award "For superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures". Welles pretended to be out of town and sent [[John Huston]] to claim the award, thanking the Academy on film. Huston criticized the Academy for awarding Welles, even while they refused to give Welles any work.

In 1972, Welles acted as on-screen narrator for the film documentary version of [[Alvin Toffler]]'s 1970 book ''[[Future Shock]]''. Working again for a British producer, Welles played [[Long John Silver]] in director [[John Hough (director)|John Hough]]'s ''[[Treasure Island (1972 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1972), an adaptation of the [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] novel, which had been the second story broadcast by ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'' in 1938. This was the last time he played the lead role in a major film. Welles also contributed to the script, his writing credit was attributed to the pseudonym 'O. W. Jeeves'. Some of Welles' original recorded dialog was redubbed by [[Robert Rietty]].

[[File:F-for-Fake.jpg|thumb|Orson Welles in ''[[F for Fake]]'' (1973), a [[Essay#Film|film essay]] and the last film he completed.]]
In 1973, Welles completed ''[[F for Fake]]'', a personal essay film about art forger [[Elmyr de Hory]] and the biographer [[Clifford Irving]]. Based on an existing documentary by [[François Reichenbach]], it included new material with [[Oja Kodar]], Joseph Cotten, [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]] and [[William Alland]]. An excerpt of Welles's 1930s ''War of the Worlds'' broadcast was recreated for this film; however, none of the dialogue heard in the film actually matches what was originally broadcast. Welles filmed a five-minute trailer, rejected in the U.S., that featured several shots of a topless Kodar.

Welles hosted and narrated a syndicated anthology series, ''[[Orson Welles' Great Mysteries|Orson Welles's Great Mysteries]],'' over the 1973–1974 television season. It did not last beyond that season; however, the program could be perceived as a television revival of the Mercury Theatre whose executive producer Welles had been in the 1930s and 1940s. The year 1974 also saw Welles lending his voice for that year's remake of [[Agatha Christie]]'s classic thriller ''[[And Then There Were None (1974 film)|Ten Little Indians]]'' produced by his former associate, Harry Alan Towers and starring an international cast that included [[Oliver Reed]], [[Elke Sommer]] and [[Herbert Lom]].

In 1975, Welles narrated the documentary ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]'', focusing on [[Warner Bros.]] cartoons from the 1940s. Also in 1975, the [[American Film Institute]] presented Welles with its third Lifetime Achievement Award (the first two going to director [[John Ford]] and actor [[James Cagney]]). At the ceremony, Welles screened two scenes from the nearly finished ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]''.

In 1976, [[Paramount Television]] purchased the rights for the entire set of [[Rex Stout]]'s [[Nero Wolfe]] stories for Orson Welles.{{efn|Pre-production materials for ''Nero Wolfe'' (1976) are contained in the Orson Welles – Oja Kodar Papers at the University of Michigan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/s/sclead/umich-scl-welleskodar?byte=6167578;focusrgn=C01;subview=standard;view=reslist |title=Orson Welles – Oja Kodar Papers 1910–1998 (Box 17) |publisher=[[University of Michigan]] Special Collections Library |access-date=2015-05-09}}</ref>}}<ref name="Kleiner">{{cite news |last=Kleiner |first=Dick |authorlink=Dick Kleiner |date=December 30, 1976 |title=No title |url= |newspaper=[[Oakland Tribune]] |location= |access-date= }}</ref><ref name="Lochte">{{cite news |last=Lochte |first=Dick |date=January 30, 1977 |title=TV finally tunes in Nero Wolfe |url= |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Liz |authorlink=Liz Smith (journalist) |date=March 14, 1977 |title=People |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |quote=Paramount bought the entire set of Nero Wolfe stories for Orson Welles, who is enjoying a renaissance of popularity in Hollywood and the world. }}</ref> Welles had once wanted to make a series of Nero Wolfe movies, but Rex Stout – who was leery of Hollywood adaptations during his lifetime after two disappointing 1930s films – turned him down.<ref name="Lochte"/>{{efn|Lochte interviewed Rex Stout May 27, 1967.<ref>{{cite book |last=McAleer |first=John J. |date=1977 |title=Rex Stout: A Biography |location=Boston |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |isbn=9780316553407 }}</ref>{{Rp|479–480}}}} Paramount planned to begin with an [[Nero Wolfe (film)|ABC-TV movie]] and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a mini-series.<ref name="Kleiner"/> [[Frank D.

In 1979, Welles completed his documentary ''[[Filming Othello]]'', which featured Michael MacLiammoir and Hilton Edwards. Made for West German television, it was also released in theaters. That same year, Welles completed his self-produced pilot for ''[[The Orson Welles Show (TV pilot)|The Orson Welles Show]]'' television series, featuring interviews with [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Jim Henson]] and [[Frank Oz]] and guest-starring [[The Muppets]] and [[Angie Dickinson]]. Unable to find network interest, the pilot was never broadcast. Also in 1979, Welles appeared in the biopic ''[[The Secret of Nikola Tesla]]'', and a cameo in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' as Lew Lord.

Beginning in the late 1970s, Welles participated in a series of famous television commercial advertisements. For two years he was on-camera spokesman for the [[Paul Masson]] Vineyards,{{efn|Paul Masson's spokesman since 1979, Welles parted company with Paul Masson in 1981, and in 1982 he was replaced by [[John Gielgud]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Associated Press |first= |date=October 26, 1982 |title=People in the News }}</ref>}} and sales grew by one third during the time Welles intoned what became a popular catchphrase: "We will sell no wine before its time."<ref>Bronson, Gail, "In Advertising, Big Names Mean Big Money."

''[[The New York Times]]'', May 3, 1981</ref> and provided narration on adverts for [[Findus]], though the actual adverts have been overshadowed by a famous [[blooper reel]] of voice recordings, known as the [[Frozen Peas]] reel.  He also did commercials for the Preview Subscription Television Service seen on stations around the country including WCLQ/Cleveland, KNDL/St. Louis and WSMW/Boston.

In 1981, Welles hosted the documentary ''[[The Man Who Saw Tomorrow]]'', about [[Renaissance]]-era prophet [[Nostradamus]]. In 1982, the BBC broadcast ''The Orson Welles Story'' in the ''[[Arena (TV series)|Arena]]'' series. Interviewed by Leslie Megahey, Welles examined his past in great detail, and several people from his professional past were interviewed as well. It was reissued in 1990 as ''With Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film''. Welles provided narration for the tracks "Defender" from [[Manowar]]'s 1987 album ''[[Fighting the World]]'' and "Dark Avenger" on their 1982 album, ''[[Battle Hymns (Manowar album)|Battle Hymns]]''. His name was misspelled on the latter album, as he was credited as "Orson Wells".<ref>{{IMDb name|80|section=bio}}</ref>

During the 1980s, Welles worked on such film projects as ''[[The Dreamers (unfinished film)|The Dreamers]]'', based on two stories by [[Isak Dinesen]] and starring Oja Kodar, and ''[[Orson Welles' Magic Show]]'', which reused material from his failed TV pilot. Another project he worked on was ''[[Filming The Trial]]'', the second in a proposed series of documentaries examining his feature films. While much was shot for these projects, none of them was completed. All of them were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.

In 1984, Welles narrated the short-lived television series ''[[Scene of the Crime (1984 TV series)|Scene of the Crime]]''. During the early years of ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', Welles was the voice of the unseen character Robin Masters, a famous writer and [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]]. Welles's death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series. In an oblique homage to Welles, the ''Magnum, P.I.'' producers ambiguously concluded that story arc by having one character accuse another of having hired an actor to portray Robin Masters.<ref>[[Magnum, P.I.]], episode "Paper War", 1986</ref>  He also, in this penultimate year released a music single, titled "I Know What It Is To Be Young (But You Don't Know What It Is To Be Old)", which he recorded under Italian label [[Compagnia Generale del Disco]]. The song was performed with the [[Nick Perito|Nick Perito Orchestra]] and the [[Ray Charles Singers]] and produced by [[Jerry Abbott]] who was father to famed metal guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Orson-Welles-I-Know-What-It-Is-To-Be-Young-But-You-Dont-Know-What-It-Is-To-Be-Old/release/1428788 |title=Orson Welles - I Know What It Is To Be Young (But You Don't Know What It Is To Be Old) (CD) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=June 25, 1996 |accessdate=December 21, 2012}}</ref>

The last film roles before Welles's death included voice work in the animated films ''[[The Enchanted Journey]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' (1986), in which he played the planet-eating [[robot]] [[Unicron]]. His last film appearance was in [[Henry Jaglom]]'s 1987 independent film ''[[Someone to Love (film)|Someone to Love]]'', released after his death but produced before his voice-over in ''Transformers: The Movie''. His last television appearance was on the television show ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''. He recorded an introduction to an episode entitled "The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice", which was partially filmed in black and white. The episode aired five days after his death and was dedicated to his memory.

In the mid-1980s, Henry Jaglom taped lunch conversations with Welles at Los Angeles's Ma Maison as well as in New York. Edited transcripts of these sessions appear in [[Peter Biskind]]'s 2013 book ''My Lunches With Orson: Conversations Between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles''.<ref name=Biskind>{{cite web|last=Biskind|first=Peter|title=Three Courses of Orson Welles|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/06/orson-welles-lunch-with-henry-jaglom.html|work=New York magazine|publisher=New York Media LLC|accessdate=28 June 2013}}</ref>

Orson Welles and Chicago-born actress and socialite Virginia Nicolson (1916–1996) were married on November 14, 1934.<ref name="Welles TIOW"/>{{Rp|332|date=April 2014}} The couple divorced on February 1, 1940.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=942 |title=A Daughter Remembers Orson Welles: A talk with Chris Welles Feder on her new book, ''In My Father’s Shadow'' – Part One|publisher=Lawrence French, Wellesnet, November 8, 2009 |accessdate=November 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19400201&id=2-BPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nFQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6555,8524 |title=Orson Welles is Divorced by Wife |publisher=[[Associated Press]] (''[[Evening Independent]]''), February 1, 1940 |accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref>

Welles fell in love with Mexican actress [[Dolores del Río]], ten years his senior, with whom he was involved between 1938 and 1942.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ramón|first=David|title=Dolores del Río|publisher=Clío|year=1997|pages=56–61, |isbn=968-6932-35-6}}</ref> They acted together in the movie ''[[Journey into Fear (1943 film)|Journey into Fear]]'' (1943) but the affair ended soon after filming ended.

Welles married [[Rita Hayworth]] in 1943. The couple became estranged by 1946 – Welles blamed Hayworth for making unfounded accusations of infidelity, and after he was turned out of the marital bed he then actually started to have affairs, which in turn prompted Hayworth to have affairs of her own. They briefly reconciled in 1947 during the making of ''The Lady from Shanghai'', before finally separating.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} They were divorced on November 10, 1947.<ref name="Leaming Hayworth"/>{{Rp|142}} During his last interview, recorded for ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' on the evening before his death, Welles called Hayworth "one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived … and we were a long time together — I was lucky enough to have been with her longer than any of the other men in her life."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZEWy--VsBQ&list=UUaxAJybXd-1ahQ9OV1J2WaA |title=Orson Welles' Last Interview (excerpt) |publisher=''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', October 10, 1985 |accessdate=2014-09-11}}</ref>

In 1955, Welles married actress [[Paola Mori]] (née Countess Paola di Girifalco), an Italian aristocrat who starred as Raina Arkadin in his 1955 film, ''[[Mr. Arkadin]]''. The couple had embarked on a passionate affair, and after she became pregnant they were married at her parents' insistence.<ref name="Feder">Feder, Chris Welles, ''In My Father's Shadow: A Daughter Remembers Orson Welles''. Chapel Hill, North Carolina: Algonquin Books, 2009, ISBN 9781565125995</ref>{{Rp|168|date=April 2014}} They were wed in London May 8, 1955,<ref name="Welles TIOW" />{{Rp|417, 419|date=May 2012}} and never divorced.

Croatian-born actress [[Oja Kodar]] became Welles's longtime companion both personally and professionally from 1966 onwards, and they lived together for some of the last 19 years of his life. They first met in Zagreb in 1962, while Welles was filming ''The Trial'', and embarked on a passionate, short-lived affair which ended when Paola Mori had a cancer scare and Welles returned to his wife. Kodar assumed Welles had left for good, and Welles hired a private detective to track down Kodar, to no avail. Three years passed, and Kodar was by then living in Paris and in a relationship with a struggling young actor. When they saw a press feature that Welles was in Paris, the young actor persuaded a reluctant Kodar to use her influence with Welles to get him a job. When she telephoned him, Welles immediately rushed to her hotel room, broke down the door, and pulled out a small metal box from his jacket. It contained a love letter to her.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

With the passing years, Welles's domestic arrangements became more complicated. From 1966 he always maintained at least two separate homes, one with Kodar, the other with Mori and their daughter Beatrice. In the 1960s and 1970s, he shared houses just outside Paris and [[Madrid]] with Kodar. Although British tabloids reported his affair with Kodar as early as 1969 (which was a factor in his moving permanently to the United States in 1970), both Mori and Beatrice remained oblivious as to Kodar's existence until 1984. Welles set up a home with Mori and Beatrice in the United States (first in [[Sedona]], then in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]), ostensibly because the climate would be good for his asthma. But while they lived in Las Vegas, he spent most of his time in Los Angeles, where he openly shared a house with Kodar.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

This situation had serious ramifications for the copyright status of his work after his death. Welles left Kodar his Los Angeles home and the rights to his unfinished films, and turned the rest over to Mori. Mori contended that she should have been left everything, and a year after Welles's death, Mori and Kodar finally agreed on the settlement of his will. On the way to their meeting to sign the papers, however, Mori was killed in a car accident in August 1986. Mori's half of the estate was inherited by Beatrice, who refused to come to an arrangement with Kodar, who she blames for undermining her parents' marriage.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Welles had three daughters from his marriages: Christopher Welles Feder (born March 27, 1938, with Virginia Nicolson); Rebecca Welles Manning (December 17, 1944 – October 17, 2004,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tribnet/obituary.aspx?pid=2737245 |title=Rebecca Manning Obituary |publisher=''[[The News Tribune]]'', Tacoma, Washington, October 21–22, 2004 |accessdate=2014-05-11}}</ref> with Rita Hayworth); and Beatrice Welles (born November 13, 1955, with Paola Mori). His only known son, British director [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]] (Sir Michael Lindsay-Hogg, 5th baronet, born May 5, 1940), is from Welles's affair with Irish actress [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]], then the wife of Sir Edward Lindsay-Hogg, 4th baronet. Although Hogg knew Welles sporadically and occasionally worked as his assistant, and had long been rumoured to be his son given their strong physical resemblance, he refused to believe such rumours until it was confirmed to him by [[Gloria Vanderbilt]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |title=Are You My Father, Orson Welles? |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/books/review/luck-and-circumstance-by-michael-lindsay-hogg-book-review.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&hpw |publisher= |newspaper=The New York Times |last=Witchel|first=Alex |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref> In her autobiography, ''In My Father's Shadow'', Feder wrote about being a childhood friend and neighbor of Lindsay-Hogg's and always suspecting he might be her half-brother.<ref>Vanessa Thorpe [http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/jan/31/orson-welles-son "The 'Only Son' of Orson Welles to Take DNA Test",] ''The Observer'', January 30, 2010</ref>

After the death of Rebecca Welles Manning, a man named Marc McKerrow was revealed to be her biological son, and therefore the direct descendant of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth. McKerrow's reactions to the revelation and his meeting with Oja Kodar are documented in the 2008 film ''[[Prodigal Sons (film)|Prodigal Sons]]''.<ref name="SF Chronicle March 2010">{{cite news |title=Twists, turns in 'Prodigal Sons' documentary |url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Twists-turns-in-Prodigal-Sons-documentary-3197738.php |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |last=Weigand |first=David |date=March 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 17, 2012}}</ref> McKerrow died June 18, 2010.<ref name="Marc McKerrow Foundation Home">{{cite web |title=In beloved memory of Marc McKerrow |url=http://www.marcmckerrowfoundation.org/Home.html |publisher=Marc McKerrow Foundation |year=2010 |accessdate=November 6, 2013}}</ref>

Despite an [[urban legend]] promoted by Welles himself,{{efn|For example, while bantering with Lucille Ball on a 1944 broadcast of ''[[The Orson Welles Almanac]]'' before an audience of U.S. Navy service members, Welles says, "My great-granduncle was Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy in Lincoln's cabinet".

The myth dates back to the first newspaper feature ever written about Welles — "Cartoonist, Actor, Poet and only 10" — in the February 19, 1926, issue of ''[[The Capital Times]]''. The article falsely states that he was descended from "Gideon Welles, who was a member of President Lincoln's cabinet".<ref name="Higham"/>{{Rp|47–48}}<ref name="McBride"/>{{Rp|311}} As presented by Charles Higham in a genealogical chart that introduces his 1985 biography of Welles, Orson Welles's father was Richard Head Welles (born Wells), son of Richard Jones Wells, son of Henry Hill Wells (who had an uncle named Gideon ''Wells''), son of [[William H. Wells|William Hill Wells]], son of Richard Wells (1734–1801).<ref name="Higham"/>

===Physical characteristics===
In his 1956 biography, Peter Noble describes Welles as "a magnificent figure of a man, over six feet tall, handsome, with flashing eyes and a gloriously resonant speaking-voice".<ref name="Noble">Noble, Peter, ''The Fabulous Orson Welles''. London: [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson and Co.]], 1956.</ref>{{Rp|19}} Welles said that a voice specialist once told him he was born to be a [[Tenor#heldentenor|heldentenor]], a heroic tenor, but that when he was young and working at the Dublin Gate Theatre he forced his voice down into a [[bass-baritone]].<ref name="Tarbox"/>{{Rp|144}}

"Never robust, even as a baby Welles was given to ill health", wrote biographer Frank Brady, who notes that from infancy Welles suffered from asthma, sinus headaches and back pain, with bouts of diphtheria, measles, whooping cough and malaria. "As he grew older," Brady wrote, "his ill health was exacerbated by the late hours he was allowed to keep [and] an early penchant for alcohol and tobacco".<ref name="Brady"/>{{Rp|8}}

In 1928, at age 13, Welles was already more than six feet tall and weighed over 180 pounds.<ref name="Higham"/>{{Rp|50}} He reached a height of six feet three and a half inches,<ref name="Meryman">Meryman, Richard, ''Mank: The Wit, World, and Life of Herman Mankiewicz''. New York: Morrow, 1978. ISBN 0688033563</ref>{{Rp|242}} but biographer [[Simon Callow]] notes a loss of height detailed in a medical examination Welles had April 24, 1941, after the physical trials of making ''Citizen Kane''. Welles complained of "attacks of knife-like pain behind the sternal notch with sensations of smothering":

<blockquote>The physical examination (which records his height as 72 inches, three and a half inches shorter than his usual reported height, and his weight as 218 lbs: 15.5 stones) further reveals [[scoliosis]] of the spine, and [[Spina bifida#Spina bifida occulta|spina bifida occulta]].

"Crash diets, drugs, and corsets had slimmed him for his early film roles," wrote biographer Barton Whaley. "Then always back to

==Politics==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
Welles was politically active from the beginning of his career. He remained aligned with the [[Left-wing politics|left]] throughout his life,<ref name=Callow>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/20/biography.film |title='This Greater Drama' |first=Simon |last=Callow |date=May 19, 2006 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> and always defined his political orientation as "[[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]]". He was a strong supporter of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[New Deal]], and often spoke out on radio in support of progressive politics.<ref name=Callow /> He campaigned heavily for Roosevelt in the 1944 election.<ref name=Callow />

For several years, he wrote a newspaper column on political issues and considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1946, representing his home state of Wisconsin (a seat that was ultimately won by [[Joseph McCarthy]]).<ref name=Callow />

Welles' name and political activities are reported on pages 155-157 of [[Red Channels]], the [[anti-Communist]] publication that, in part, fueled the already frlouishing [[Hollywood Blacklist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.authentichistory.com/1946-1960/4-cwhomefront/1-mccarthyism/Red_Channels/index.html | title='Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television (1950)' | date=July 18, 2012 | work=AuthenticHistory.com}}</ref>  He was in Europe during the the height of the [[Red Scare]], thereby nullifying more reasons for the Hollywood establishment to ostracize him.

In 1970, Welles narrated (but did not write) a satirical political record on the administration of President [[Richard Nixon]] titled ''The Begatting of the President''.

He was also an early and outspoken critic of [[Racism in the United States|American racism]] and the practice of [[Racial segregation|segregation]].

==Death and tributes==
On the evening of October 9, 1985, Welles recorded his final interview on the syndicated TV program, ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', appearing with biographer Barbara Leaming.

==Unfinished projects==
Welles's reliance on self-production meant that many of his later projects were filmed piecemeal or were not completed. Welles financed his later projects through his own fundraising activities. He often also took on other work to obtain money to fund his own films.

===''Don Quixote''===
{{main| Don Quixote (unfinished film)}}
In the mid-1950s, Welles began work on ''Don Quixote'', initially a commission from [[CBS]] television. Welles expanded the film to feature length, developing the screenplay to take Quixote and [[Sancho Panza]] into the modern age. Filming stopped with the death of [[Francisco Reiguera]], the actor playing Quixote, in 1969. Orson Welles continued editing the film into the early 1970s. At the time of his death, the film remained largely a collection of footage in various states of editing. The project and more importantly Welles's conception of the project changed radically over time. A version of the film was created from available fragments in 1992 and released to a very negative reception.
A version Oja Kodar supervised, with help from Jess Franco, assistant director during production, was released in 2008 to mixed reactions.
Frederick Muller - the film editor for The Trial, Chimes at Midnight and the CBS Special "Orson Bag" was fortunate to work on editing three reels of the original, unadulterated version - was asked for his opinion in 2013 from a journalist of Time Out, his reply was he felt that if released without image re-editing but with the addition of ad hoc sound and music it probably would have been rather successful.

===''The Merchant of Venice''===

===''The Other Side of the Wind''===
{{main| The Other Side of the Wind}}
In 1970, Welles began shooting ''The Other Side of the Wind''. The film relates the efforts of a film director (played by [[John Huston]]) to complete his last Hollywood picture and is largely set at a lavish party. By 1972 the filming was reported by Welles as being "96% complete",<ref name="Brady"/>{{Rp|546}} though it is likely that Welles had only edited about 40 minutes of the film by 1979.<ref name="Rosenbaum"/>{{Rp|320}} In that year, legal complications over the ownership of the film forced the negative into a Paris vault. In 2004 director [[Peter Bogdanovich]], who acted in the film, announced his intention to complete the production. As of 2009, legal complications over the Welles estate had kept the film from being finished or released.

On October 28, 2014, the Los Angeles-based production company Royal Road Entertainment announced that it had negotiated an agreement, with the assistance of producer [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], and would purchase the rights to complete and release ''The Other Side of the Wind''.

===Other unfinished films and unfilmed screenplays===
*''[[Too Much Johnson]]'', a 1938 [[comedy film]] written and directed by Welles. Designed as the cinematic aspect of Welles's Mercury Theatre stage presentation of [[William Gillette]]'s 1894 comedy, the film was not completely edited or publicly screened. ''Too Much Johnson'' was considered a [[lost film]] until August 2013 news reports that a pristine print was discovered in Italy in 2008. A copy restored by the [[George Eastman House]] museum was scheduled to premiere October 9, 2013, at the [[Pordenone Silent Film Festival]], with a U.S. premiere to follow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/10230843/Unfinished-Orson-Welles-film-found-in-Italy.html |title=Unfinished Orson Welles film found in Italy |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2013}}</ref> A single performance of Too Much Johnson, on 2/2/15, at the Film Forum in NYC, was a great success. Produced by Bruce Goldstein and adapted and directed by Allen Lewis Rickman, it featured the Film Forum Players with live piano. 
*''[[Heart of Darkness]]'': Welles's projected first film in 1940, planned in extreme detail and with some test shots filmed. (The footage is now lost.) It was planned to be entirely shot in [[long take]]s from the point of view of the narrator, [[Charles Marlow|Marlow]], who would be played by Welles; his reflection would occasionally be seen in the window as his boat sailed down river. The project was abandoned because it could not be delivered on budget, and ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' was made instead.<ref name="Welles TIOW" />{{Rp|30–33, 355–356|date=May 2012}}
*''The Life of Christ'': In 1941, Welles received the support of [[Fulton J. Sheen|Bishop Fulton Sheen]] for a retelling of the life of Christ to be set in the American West in the 1890s. After filming of ''Citizen Kane'' was complete,<ref>Welles, Orson, and Peter Bogdanovich, ''[[This is Orson Welles]]''. HarperAudio, September 30, 1992.

Welles wrote a screenplay with dialogue from the Gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke. "Every word in the film was to be from the Bible — no original dialogue, but done as a sort of American primitive," Welles said, "set in the frontier country in the last century." The unrealized project was revisited by Welles in the 1950s when he wrote a second unfilmed screenplay, to be shot in Egypt.<ref name="Welles TIOW" />{{Rp|361–362|date=April 2014}}
*''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'': Welles did not originally want to direct this 1942 documentary on South America, but after its abandonment by RKO, he spent much of the 1940s attempting to buy the negative of his material from RKO, so that he could edit and release it in some form. The footage remained unseen in vaults for decades, and was assumed lost. Over 50 years later, some (but not all) of the surviving material saw release in the 1993 documentary ''It's All True: Based on an Unfinished Film by Orson Welles''.
*''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'': In 1944, Welles wrote the first-draft script of this film, which he also intended to direct. [[Charlie Chaplin]] initially agreed to star in it, but later changed his mind, citing never having been directed by someone else in a [[feature film|feature]] before. Chaplin bought the film rights and made the film himself in 1947, with some changes (Welles said the [[gallows]] scenes were written by Chaplin, but that much of the film was unchanged from his own script). The final film credits Chaplin with the script, "based on an idea by Orson Welles".
*''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'': Welles spent around nine months c. 1947-8 co-writing the screenplay for this along with [[Ben Hecht]], a project Welles was assigned to direct for [[Alexander Korda]]. He began scouting for locations in Europe whilst filming ''[[Black Magic (1949 film)|Black Magic]]'', but Korda was short of money, so sold the rights to Columbia pictures, who eventually dismissed Welles from the project, and then sold the rights on to [[United Artists]], who in turn [[Cyrano de Bergerac (1950 film)|made a film version in 1950]], which was not based on Welles's script.<ref name="Welles TIOW" />{{Rp|106–108|date=May 2012}}
*''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'': After Welles's elaborate musical stageshow of this [[Jules Verne]] novel, encompassing 38 different sets, he began shooting some test footage in Morocco for a film version in 1947. The footage was never edited, funding never came through, and Welles abandoned the project. Nine years later, the stage show's producer [[Mike Todd]] made [[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|his own award-winning film version of the book]].<ref name="Welles TIOW" />{{Rp|402|date=May 2012}}

Using bare, minimalist sets, Welles alternated between a cast of nineteenth-century actors rehearsing a production of ''Moby Dick'', with scenes from ''Moby Dick'' itself. [[Kenneth Williams]], a cast member who was apprehensive about the entire project, recorded in his autobiography that Welles's dim, atmospheric stage lighting made some of the footage so dark as to be unwatchable. The entire play was filmed, but is now presumed lost. This was made during one weekend at the [[Hackney Empire]] theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.str.org.uk/events/lectures/archive/lecture0811.shtml |title=See also the relevant entries for 'Moby Dick' in Kenneth Williams' autobiography '&#39;Just Williams'&#39; |publisher=Str.org.uk |accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>
*''[[Histoires extraordinaires]]'': The producers of this 1968 [[anthology film]], based on short stories by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], announced in June 1967 that Welles would direct one segment based on both "[[Masque of the Red Death]]" and "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]" for the omnibus film. Welles withdrew in September 1967 and was replaced.

*''One-Man Band'': This [[Monty Python]]-esque spoof in which Welles plays all but one of the characters (including two characters in [[drag (clothing)|drag]]), was made around 1968-9. Welles intended this completed sketch to be one of several items in a television special on London. Other items filmed for this special – all included in the "One Man Band" documentary by his partner [[Oja Kodar]] – comprised a sketch on Winston Churchill (played in silhouette by Welles), a sketch on [[Peerage|peers]] in a stately home, a feature on [[gentlemen's clubs|London gentlemen's clubs]], and a sketch featuring Welles being mocked by his snide [[Savile Row]] tailor (played by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117262/ |title=Orson Welles: The One-Man Band | publisher=IMDB |accessdate=October 5, 2009}}</ref>
*''[[Treasure Island (1972 film)|Treasure Island]]'': Welles wrote two screenplays for this in the 1960s, and was eager to seek financial backing to direct it. Eventually, his own screenplay (under the pseudonym of O.W. Jeeves) was further rewritten, and formed the basis of [[Treasure Island (1972 film)|the 1972 film version]] directed by [[John Hough (director)|John Hough]], in which Welles played [[Long John Silver]].
*''[[The Deep (Orson Welles film)|The Deep]]'': An adaptation of [[Charles Williams (U.S. author)|Charles Williams]]' ''[[Dead Calm]]''. The picture was entirely set on two boats and shot mostly in close-ups, and was filmed off the coasts of [[Yugoslavia]] and [[the Bahamas]], between 1966 and 1969, with all but one scene completed. Originally planned as commercially viable thriller, to show that Welles could make a popular, successful film. It was put on hold in 1970 when Welles worried that critics would not respond favourably to this film as his theatrical follow-up to the much-lauded ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]'', and Welles focused instead on ''[[F for Fake]]''. It was abandoned altogether in 1973 due to the death of its star [[Laurence Harvey]].
*''[[Jodorowsky's Dune|Dune]]'': An early attempt at adapting [[Frank Herbert|Frank Herbert's]] sci-fi novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' by Chilean film director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] was to star Welles as the evil [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]], whom Jodorowsky had personally chosen for the role. However, the planned film never advanced past pre-production.
*''[[Saint Jack]]''. In 1978 Welles was lined up by his long-time protégé [[Peter Bogdanovich]] (who was then acting as Welles's ''de facto'' agent) to direct this adaptation of the 1973 [[Paul Theroux]] novel about an American pimp in Singapore. [[Hugh Hefner]] and Bogdnovich's then-partner [[Cybill Shepherd]] were both attached to the project as producers, with Hefner providing finance through his [[Playboy]] productions. However, both Hefner and Shepherd became convinced that Bogdanovich himself would be a more commercially viable director than Welles, and insisted that Bogdanovich take over. Since Bogdanovich was also in need of work after a series of box office flops, he agreed. When the film was finally made in 1979 by Bogdanovich and Hefner (but without Welles or Shepherd's participation), Welles felt betrayed and according to Bogdanovich the two "drifted apart a bit".<ref>Peter Bogdanovich and Orson Welles, ''This is Orson Welles'' (New York, 1992, revised 1997 edition) pp.xxi-xxii</ref>
*''Filming The Trial'': After the success of his 1978 film ''Filming Othello'' made for West German television, and mostly consisting of a monologue to the camera, Welles began shooting scenes for this follow-up film, but never completed it.<ref name="McBride"/>{{Rp|253|April 2014}} What Welles did film was an 80-minute question-and-answer session in 1981 with film students asking about the film. The footage was kept by Welles's cinematographer [[Gary Graver]], who donated it to the Munich Film Museum, which then pieced it together with Welles's trailer for the film, into an 83-minute film which is occasionally screened at film festivals.
*''[[The Big Brass Ring]]'': This 1982 screenplay, written by Welles with [[Oja Kodar]] was adapted and filmed by director [[George Hickenlooper]] in partnership with writer [[F.X. Feeney]]. Both the Welles script and the 1999 film center on a U.S. Presidential hopeful in his 40s, his elderly mentor—a former candidate for the Presidency, brought low by homosexual scandal—and the Italian journalist probing for the truth of the relationship between these men. During the last years of his life, Welles struggled to get financing for the planned film; however, his efforts at casting [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Warren Beatty]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Burt Reynolds]] and [[Paul Newman]] as the main character were unsuccessful. All of the actors turned down the role for various reasons.
*'' Cradle Will Rock'': Welles planned on writing and directing a film about the 1937 staging of ''The Cradle Will Rock.'' [[Rupert Everett]] was slated to play the young Welles. However, Welles was unable to acquire funding. [[Tim Robbins]] later directed [[Cradle Will Rock|a similar film]], but it was not based on Welles's script.
*''[[King Lear]]'': At the time of his death, Welles was in talks with a French production company to direct a film version of the Shakespeare play, in which he would also play the title role.
*An adaptation of [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle|Ada]]'' for which Welles flew to Paris to discuss the project personally with the Russian author.
