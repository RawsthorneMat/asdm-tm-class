In 2002, Kidman won critical praise for her portrayal of [[Virginia Woolf]] in [[Stephen Daldry]]'s ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'', which also featured [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Julianne Moore]]. Kidman wore prosthetics that were applied to her nose making her almost unrecognisable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, ''[[Mrs. Dalloway]]''. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that, "Kidman tunnels like a ferret into the soul of a woman besieged by excruciating bouts of mental illness. As you watch her wrestle with the demon of depression, it is as if its torment has never been shown on the screen before. Directing her desperate, furious stare into the void, her eyes not really focusing, Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain".<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0DE6DE113CF934A15751C1A9649C8B63&partner=Rotten Tomatoes "The Hours (2002), FILM REVIEW; Who's Afraid Like Virginia Woolf?"] ''The New York Times''</ref> Kidman won numerous critics' awards, including her first [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], third [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress&nbsp;– Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]], and the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]].

Because art is important. And because you believe in what you do and you want to honour that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld."<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101118&page=1 Memorable Moments From Oscar Night].

Following her Oscar win, Kidman appeared in three very different films in 2003.

The second was an adaptation of [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Human Stain (film)|The Human Stain]]'', opposite [[Anthony Hopkins]]. Her third film was [[Anthony Minghella]]'s war drama ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]''.

In 2004 she appeared in the film, ''[[Birth (film)|Birth]]'', which received controversy over a scene in which Kidman shares a bath with her co-star, 10-year-old [[Cameron Bright]]. At a press conference at the [[Venice Film Festival]], Kidman addressed the controversy saying, "It wasn't that I wanted to make a film where I kiss a 10-year-old boy.
