'''Frank Darabont''' (born '''Darabont Ferenc'''; January 28, 1959) is a Hungarian-American<ref name="postmortem">[http://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2088081689 "Post Mortem with Mick Garris": Episode 1 – Frank Darabont]</ref> [[film director]], [[screenwriter]] and [[Film producer|producer]] who has been nominated for three [[Academy Award]]s and a [[Golden Globe Award]]. In his early career he was primarily a screenwriter for [[horror (genre)|horror]] films such as ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'', ''[[The Blob (1988 film)|The Blob]]'' and ''[[The Fly II]]''. As a director he is known for his film adaptations of [[Stephen King]] novels such as ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'', and ''[[The Mist (film)|The Mist]]''. He also developed and executive produced the [[The Walking Dead (season 1)|first season]] and part of the [[The Walking Dead (season 2)|second season]] of the horror series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' and created the [[neo-noir]] series ''[[Mob City]]''.

==Early life==
Darabont was born in a refugee camp in 1959 in [[Montbéliard]], Doubs, France. His parents fled [[Hungary]] after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]]. When he was still an infant, his family moved to the United States, settling in Chicago. When Darabont was five the family moved to Los Angeles.<ref name="postmortem"/> Darabont was inspired to pursue a career in film after seeing the [[George Lucas]] film ''[[THX 1138]]'' in his youth.<ref name="austin">{{cite web|url=http://www.onstory.tv/player/2.php?xrlink=A_CONVERSATION_WITH_FRANK_DARABONT.mp3%20&xilink=|title=A Conversation With Frank Darabont}}</ref> Darabont graduated from [[Hollywood High School]] in 1977 and did not attend college.<ref name="1997interview">[http://ubuntuone.com/7fRrJpVvEyjyTmcTdTmSfT Frank Darabont Interview]</ref> His first jobs after finishing school included working as a [[forklift]] operator and as a [[busboy]]. He claims he got his writing skills from "endless hours" of writing at a desk on a typewriter in his free time, and from his childhood friend Cody Hills, whom he still has brunch with down at the local Golden Corral almost daily to discuss new ideas.<ref name="1997interview"/>

==Career==

===Early works===
Darabont became involved in filmmaking by becoming a production assistant on such films as ''[[Hell Night]]'', ''[[The Seduction (film)|The Seduction]]'' and ''[[Trancers]]''. The first film he wrote and directed was a short adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Woman in the Room]]'', which was one of the first "[[Dollar Baby|Dollar Babies]]" and made the semi-finalist list for [[Academy Award]] consideration in 1983. Although Darabont was not happy with how the short turned out, it led to a close association with King, who granted him the "handshake deal" rights to another one of his shorter works, ''[[Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption]]'' from the collection ''[[Different Seasons]]''.<ref name="postmortem"/>

Darabont sold his first screenplay titled ''Black Cat Run'' in 1986, but it was not produced until over a decade later as a television film under the same name.<ref name="1997interview"/> Darabont was approached by [[Chuck Russell]] (who was a producer on ''Hell Night'' and ''The Seduction'') with an offer to become his writing partner, as he had become interested in Darabont's writing after reading a [[spec script]] he had written for the television series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''.<ref name="austin"/> The two began working on a script for a remake of the film ''[[The Blob]]'', which they had planned to shop around to studios, until they were both hired to rewrite the script of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'' with Russell directing the film. The two were only given two weeks to rewrite the script and managed to do it in ten days. The success of their ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' film allowed them to produce the first script they had originally written, ''[[The Blob (1988 film)|The Blob]]''.<ref name="austin"/> Darabont was now a successful writer for hire and went on to write ''[[The Fly II]]'', an early draft of ''[[The Rocketeer (film)|The Rocketeer]]'', and an unproduced sequel to ''[[Commando (1985 film)|Commando]]''.<ref>[http://www.commandofans.com/commando2script.pdf Action Alliance Message Board – Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Darabont made his directorial debut with ''[[Buried Alive (1990 TV film)|Buried Alive]]'', a television movie with a $2,000,000 budget that aired on the [[USA Network]] in 1990. Darabont followed with an extended run as writer for [[George Lucas]]'s television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' and writing two episodes of the television series ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]''.

===''The Shawshank Redemption'' (1994)===
{{Main|The Shawshank Redemption}}
Darabont made good on the deal with Stephen King by writing and directing ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]''. [[Rob Reiner]], who had previously adapted another King novella, ''[[The Body (novella)|The Body]]'', into the movie ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'' offered Darabont $2.5&nbsp;million in an attempt to write and direct ''Shawshank''. He planned to cast [[Tom Cruise]] in the part of Andy and [[Harrison Ford]] as Red. Darabont seriously considered and liked Reiner's vision, but he ultimately decided it was his "chance to do something really great" by directing the film himself.<ref>Audio commentary with director and writer Frank Darabont</ref>

Although the film did not do well at the box office, it was met with acclaim by audiences and critics and Darabont was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)|Best Adapted Screenplay]] at the 1995 Academy Awards. The film was also nominated for six other Academy Awards including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. The film also has a great legacy, as it has been voted number one on [[IMDb]]'s user-generated Top 250 since 2008 and is considered one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]].

===''The Green Mile'' (1999)===
{{Main|The Green Mile (film)}}
Darabont's next directorial effort was another Stephen King adaptation, ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'', starring [[Tom Hanks]]. At first Darabont was reluctant to adapt the novel into a film, as its setting was too similar to ''Shawshank'', but quickly changed his mind after reading the novel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solitary Refinement|url=http://www.shawshankredemption.org/fade.htm}}</ref> Hanks and Darabont first met at an [[Academy Award]] luncheon in 1994 and the two were both eager to work on a project together. Stephen King stated he envisioned Hanks in the role and was happy when Darabont mentioned his name.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thegreenmile.warnerbros.com/cmp/cast-fr.html | title=About the Film | accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref>

The film was nominated for the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and Darabont was nominated for his second Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/72nd-winners.html |title=The 72nd Academy Awards (2000) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=November 19, 2011|work=oscars.org}}</ref> It is also the highest grossing film based on a Stephen King novel, as it made a total of $286,801,374 worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=greenmile.htm |title=The Green Mile (1999) - Box Office Mojo}}</ref>

{{Main|The Majestic (film)}}
He followed ''The Green Mile'' with the 2001 film ''[[The Majestic (film)|The Majestic]]'' starring [[Jim Carrey]], [[Martin Landau]] and [[Laurie Holden]], whom Darabont would work with again frequently throughout his career. [[Michael Sloane]], who Darabont had known since high school, wrote the script and the film remains one of the few films that Darabont directed, but did not write. Darabont wanted to direct the film as he saw it as a "love letter" to works of [[Frank Capra]] and all the other movies he has loved throughout his life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Frank Darabont from "The Majestic"|url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aa121401d.htm|publisher=About.com}}</ref> The film received mixed reviews from critics and also bombed at the box-office, recouping only half of its $72 million budget internationally.<ref name="BOM">{{cite web|title=The Majestic|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=majestic.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo}}</ref>

Darabont had originally wanted to direct ''The Mist'' even before he directed ''The Shawshank Redemption'', but kept pushing it back until 2004, when he began to write the screenplay for the film.<ref>{{cite news | author=Stax | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/808/808923p1.html | title=SDCC 07: Chatting in The Mist | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=July 28, 2007 | accessdate=November 19, 2007 }}</ref> Most of the crew that worked on the film had worked on the television series ''[[The Shield]]'', as Darabont hired them after directing an episode of the series and he thought they could help give the film a "more fluid, ragged documentary kind of direction".<ref name=con>{{cite news | author=Edward Douglas | url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/comicconnews.php?id=903 | title=Comic-Con '07: Two Clips From ''The Mist''! | publisher=ShockTillYouDrop.com | date=July 27, 2007 | accessdate=July 30, 2007 }}</ref> Darabont also helped create the designs of the creatures in the film along with artists [[Jordu Schell]], [[Bernie Wrightson]] and the film's lead [[makeup artist]] [[Greg Nicotero]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://atthamovies.com/the-most-realistic-grand-moff-tarkin-bust-ever-made/ | title = The Most Realistic Grand Moff Tarkin Bust Ever Made | publisher=At Tha Movies | date=January 27, 2014 | accessdate=January 27, 2014 }}</ref> [[Cafe FX|CafeFX]] was hired to do the film's special effects after Darabont asked fellow director [[Guillermo Del Toro]] who did the effects on his film ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''.

The film was a modest success at the box office, but earned positive reviews from critics.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Mist (2007)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mist.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> King also praised Darabont's new ending saying "The ending is such a jolt—wham!

===Other work===
Darabont also has the rights to two other Stephen King stories, ''[[The Long Walk]]'' and ''[[The Monkey]]'', both of which he says he will make eventually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2007/04/why-frank-darabont-told-george-lucas-youre-insane-over-indiana-jones-4/|title=Why Frank Darabont Told George Lucas 'You're Insane' Over 'Indiana Jones 4′|publisher=DeadlineHollywood|date=April 18, 2007}}</ref>

Darabont was a [[script doctor]] for the [[Steven Spielberg]] films  ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' and ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frank Darabont|url=http://www.shawshankredemption.net/people/frank-darabont.html|publisher=http://www.shawshankredemption.net}}</ref> In 2002, he penned an early draft of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''; while Spielberg reportedly loved it, [[George Lucas]] rejected it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lilja's Library|url=http://www.liljas-library.com/showinterview.php?id=38|}}</ref> He also produced the 2002 film ''[[The Salton Sea]]'', starring [[Val Kilmer]] and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]].

Over the years Darabont has reunited with his old writing partner [[Chuck Russell]]. He did a rewrite for Russell's film ''[[Eraser (film)|Eraser]]'', they attempted to adapt a film of the comic book series [[Doc Savage]] and the two wrote an early treatment and were executive producers on the film ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]''.<ref name="1997interview"/><ref>{{Cite web | title=Doc Savage | url=http://www.mania.com/30936.html | accessdate=May 22, 2007 | work=Mania.com Development Hell}}</ref>

He has also tried to produce film adaptions of the novels ''[[Mine (novel)|Mine]]'' by [[Robert R. McCammon]] and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' by [[Ray Bradbury]]. Darabont still hopes to make both films some day.<ref>{{Cite web |title=MINE &ndash; The Movie |url=http://www.robertmccammon.com/mine-movie.html |publisher=Robert McCammon.com}}</ref>

The same year ''Shawshank'' was released, ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994 film)|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein]]'', which Darabont wrote, was also released. The film was met with mixed reviews and Darabont called it the worst experience in his career as a writer as he had considered it the best script he had ever written, but that director [[Kenneth Branagh]] ruined it "every step of the way".<ref name="1997interview"/> He went on to say that "you can’t really judge the script based on what you saw on the screen. It got rephrased and messed with every inch of the way." [[Guillermo Del Toro]] has shown interest in adapting Darabont's draft of the ''Frankenstein'' script when he gets around to filming his own version of the story, calling the draft a "near perfect" adaption of the original book.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guillermo del Toro could shoot Darabont’s FRANKENSTEIN?|url=http://whatculture.com/film/guillermo-del-toro-could-shoot-darabonts-frankenstein.php}}</ref>

Due to scheduling conflicts, he was unable to take the job, which fell to series star (and previous helmer) [[Edward James Olmos]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18841|title=TV: Pilot Script Review for Frank Darabont's 'The Walking Dead'!|publisher=BloodyDisgusting|date=January 26, 2010 }}</ref>

In addition to collaborating with actors on films and television projects, he has collaborated with writers, producers, composers, and others. These include [[Mark Isham]], [[Stephen King]], [[Gregory Nicotero]], [[Rohn Schmidt]], [[David Tattersall]], and others. Also, [[Jeffrey DeMunn]] appeared in ''[[The Blob (1988 film)|The Blob]]''  and ''Black Cat Run'', both of which Darabont wrote, [[Alexa Davalos]] appeared in the pilot episode of ''[[Raines]]'' that he directed and [[Amin Joseph]] first worked with Darabont on an episode of ''[[The Shield]]'' titled "Chasing Ghosts".

''[[The Woman in the Room]]'' (1983 film) and ''[[Buried Alive (1990 TV film)|Buried Alive]]'' (1990) are not listed due to lack of collaborations. (Although Brian Libby appears in both.)<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0508742/ Brian Libby]</ref>
