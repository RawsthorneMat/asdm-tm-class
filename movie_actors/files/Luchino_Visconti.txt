'''Luchino [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] di [[Vimodrone|Modrone]]''', Count of Lonate Pozzolo (2 November 1906 – 17 March 1976), was an Italian theatre, opera and cinema director, as well as a screenwriter. He is best known for his films ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|The Leopard]]'' (1963) and ''[[Death in Venice (film)|Death in Venice]]'' (1971).

==Life==
[[File:COA Visconti di Modrone di Milano.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Family arms]]
Luchino Visconti was born into a prominent noble family in [[Milan]], one of seven children of Giuseppe Visconti di Modrone, Duke of Grazzano Visconti and Count of [[Lonate Pozzolo]], and his wife Carla<ref>[http://mannerofman.blogspot.com/2008/11/mm-icon-luchino-visconti.html "M/M Icon: Luchino Visconti"], ''Manner of Man Magazine'' online at mannerofman.com, 2 November 2010. Retrieved 18 November 2012</ref> (née Erba, heiress to Erba Pharmaceuticals). He was formally known as Count don Luchino Visconti di Modrone, and his family is a branch of the [[House of Visconti]]. In his early years, he was exposed to art, music and theatre: he studied cello with the Italian cellist and composer [[Lorenzo de Paolis]] (1890 - 1965) and met the composer [[Giacomo Puccini]], the conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] and the writer [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].

During [[World War II]], Visconti joined the [[Italian Communist Party]].

Visconti made no secret of his [[homosexuality]]. His last partner was the [[Austria]]n actor [[Helmut Berger]], who played Martin in Visconti's film ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]''. Berger also appeared in Visconti's ''[[Ludwig (film)|Ludwig]]'' in 1972 and ''[[Conversation Piece (film)|Conversation Piece]]'' in 1974, along with [[Burt Lancaster]]. Other lovers included [[Franco Zeffirelli]],<ref>Silva, Horacio, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/style/tmagazine/t17visconti.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin "The Aristocrat"], ''The New York Times'', 17 September 2006. (Overview of Visconti's life and career) Retrieved 7 November 2011</ref> who also worked as part of the crew in production design, as assistant director, and other roles in a number of Visconti's films, operas, and theatrical productions.

Visconti suffered a [[stroke]] in 1972, but continued to smoke heavily. He died in Rome of another stroke at the age of 69. There is a museum dedicated to the director's work in [[Ischia]].

==Career==
===Films===
He began his filmmaking career as an assistant director on [[Jean Renoir]]'s ''[[Toni (1935 film)|Toni]]'' (1935) and ''[[Partie de campagne]]'' (1936), thanks to the intercession of their common friend, [[Coco Chanel]]. After a short tour of the United States, where he visited [[Hollywood]], he returned to Italy to be Renoir's assistant again, this time for ''La [[Tosca]]'' (1939), a production that was interrupted and later completed by German director [[Karl Koch (director)|Karl Koch]] because of [[World War II]].

Together with [[Roberto Rossellini]], Visconti joined the ''[[Salon (gathering)|salotto]]'' of [[Vittorio Mussolini]] (the son of [[Benito Mussolini|Benito]], who was then the national arbitrator for cinema and other arts). Here he presumably also met [[Federico Fellini]]. With Gianni Puccini, [[Antonio Pietrangeli]] and [[Giuseppe De Santis]], he wrote the screenplay for his first film as director: ''[[Ossessione]]'' (''Obsession'', 1943), the first [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]] movie and an unofficial adaptation of the novel ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (novel)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''.

In 1948, he wrote and directed ''[[La terra trema]]'' (''The Earth Trembles''), based on the novel ''I Malavoglia'' by [[Giovanni Verga]]. In the book by Silvia Iannello, ''Le immagini e le parole dei Malavoglia'', the author selects some passages of the Verga novel, adds original comments and Acitrezza's photographic images, and devotes a chapter to the origins, remarks and frames taken from the movie.<ref>Iannello, p. ?</ref>

Visconti continued working throughout the 1950s, although he veered away from the neorealist path with his 1954 film, ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'', shot in colour. Based on the novella by [[Camillo Boito]], it is set in Austrian-occupied [[Venice]] in 1866. In this film, Visconti combines [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[romanticism]] as a way to break away from neorealism. However, as one biographer notes, "Visconti without [[Italian neorealism|neorealism]] is like [[Fritz Lang|Lang]] without [[expressionism]] and [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] without [[Formalist film theory|formalism]]".<ref>Nowell-Smith, p. 9.</ref> He describes the film as the "most Viscontian" of all Visconti's films. Visconti returned to neorealism once more with ''[[Rocco and His Brothers|Rocco e i suoi fratelli]]'' (''Rocco and His Brothers'', 1960), the story of [[Southern Italy|Southern Italians]] who migrate to Milan hoping to find financial stability. In 1961, he was a member of the jury at the [[2nd Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name="Moscow1961">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1961 |title=2nd Moscow International Film Festival (1961) |accessdate=2012-11-04 |work=MIFF}}</ref>

Throughout the 1960s, Visconti's films became more personal. ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (''The Leopard'', 1963), is based on [[Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa|Lampedusa]]'s [[The Leopard|novel of the same name]] about the decline of the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] aristocracy at the time of the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]. It starred American actor [[Burt Lancaster]] in the role of Prince Don Fabrizio. This film was distributed in America and Britain by [[Twentieth-Century Fox]], which deleted important scenes. Visconti repudiated the Twentieth-Century Fox version.

It was not until ''[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned]]'' (1969) that Visconti received a nomination for an [[Academy Award]], for "Best Screenplay". The film, one of Visconti's best-known works, concerns a German industrialist's family which slowly begins to disintegrate during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] consolidation of power at the 30s. Its decadence and lavish beauty are characteristic of Visconti's aesthetic.

Visconti's final film was ''[[L'Innocente|The Innocent]]'' (1976), in which he returns to his recurring interest in infidelity and betrayal.

===Theatre===
Visconti was also a celebrated theatre and [[opera]] director. During the years 1946 to 1960 he directed many performances of the [[Rina Morelli]]-[[Paolo Stoppa]] Company with actor [[Vittorio Gassman]] as well as many celebrated productions of operas.

Visconti's love of opera is evident in the 1954 ''Senso'', where the beginning of the film shows scenes from the fourth act of ''[[Il trovatore]]'', which were filmed at the [[Teatro La Fenice]] in Venice. Beginning when he directed a production at Milan's [[Teatro alla Scala]] of ''[[La vestale]]'' in December 1954, his career included a famous revival of ''[[La traviata]]'' at [[La Scala]] in 1955 with [[Maria Callas]] and an equally famous ''[[Anna Bolena]]'' (also at La Scala) in 1957 with Callas. A significant 1958 [[Royal Opera House]] (London) production of Verdi's five-act Italian version of ''[[Don Carlos]]'' (with [[Jon Vickers]]) followed, along with a ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' in [[Spoleto]] in 1958 and a famous black-and-white ''[[Il trovatore]]'' with scenery and costumes by [[Filippo Sanjust]] at the Royal Opera House in 1964. In 1966 Visconti's luscious ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' for the [[Vienna State Opera]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] was critically acclaimed. On the other hand, his austere 1969 ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'' with the singers clothed in geometrical costumes provoked controversy.
