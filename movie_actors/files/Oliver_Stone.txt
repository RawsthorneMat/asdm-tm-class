'''William Oliver Stone''' (born September 15, 1946) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer and [[veteran|military veteran]]. Stone came to public prominence between the mid-1980s and the early 1990s for writing and directing a series of films about the [[Vietnam War]], in which he had participated as an infantry soldier. Many of Stone's films focus on controversial American political and cultural issues and conspiracies during the late 20th century and early 21st century.

Stone's films often combine different camera and film formats within a single scene as evidenced in ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Natural Born Killers]]'', and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Riordan|date=September 1996|title=Stone: A Biography of Oliver Stone|page=377 |publisher=New York: Aurum Press|ISBN= 1-85410-444-6}}</ref> Stone has received three [[Academy Award]]s for his work on the films ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]'', ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', and ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]''. He was presented with the Extraordinary Contribution to Filmmaking Award at the 2007 [[Austin Film Festival]].

==Early life==
Stone was born in New York City, the son of Jacqueline (née Goddet) and Louis Stone (born Louis Silverstein), a [[stockbroker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/99/Oliver-Stone.html |title=Oliver Stone Biography (1946-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}</ref> He grew up in [[Manhattan]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut]].

His parents were divorced abruptly while he was away at school (1962) and this, because he was an only child, marked him deeply. Stone's mother was often absent and his father made a big impact on his life; father-son relationships were to feature heavily in Stone's films.<ref name="cadwalladr">{{cite news|last=Cadwalladr|first=Carole|title=Oliver Stone and the politics of film-making|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/jul/18/oliver-stone-chavez-wall-street|accessdate=July 22, 2010|newspaper=The Observer|date=July 18, 2010|location=paragraphs 31 and 42}}</ref> He often spent parts of his summer vacations with his maternal grandparents in France, both in Paris and [[La Ferté-sous-Jouarre]] in [[Seine-et-Marne]]. Stone also worked at 17 in the Paris mercantile exchange in sugar and cocoa&nbsp;— a job that proved inspirational to Stone for his film ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]''. He speaks [[French language|French]] fluently. Stone graduated from The Hill School in 1964.

Stone was admitted into [[Yale University]], but left after a year<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2003/sep/19/famous-failures/ |work=[[Yale Daily News]] |title= Famous Failures |first=EMILY |last=ANTHES

Stone taught for six months, after which he worked as a [[wiper (occupation)|wiper]] on a [[United States Merchant Marine]] ship, traveling to [[Oregon]]. He returned to Yale, where he dropped out a second time (in part due to working on an autobiographical novel ''[[A Child's Night Dream]]'', published 1997 by [[St. Martin's Press]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Vietnam service==
Stone first went to Saigon in June 1965 at the age of 19.<ref name="National Press Club"/>  In April 1967, he enlisted in the United States Army, as a combat soldier, requesting [[Vietnam war|combat duty in Vietnam]]. From 1967 to November 1968, he served with the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], then with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|First Cavalry Division]], earning a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] with [["V" device]] for heroism in ground combat; he was wounded twice and received a [[Purple Heart]] with an oak leaf cluster. He also received the [[Air Medal]] for participating in more than 25 helicopter combat assaults and the [[Army Commendation Medal]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Writing and directing career==

===1970s===
Stone graduated from [[New York University]] with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in [[filmmaking|film]] in 1971, where his teachers included director [[Martin Scorsese]]<ref name=NYMag-10-2013>{{cite web|last=Seitz|first=Matt|title=Oliver Stone on New York in the Sixties and Seventies and Taking Film Classes With Martin Scorsese|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/oliver-stone-on-going-to-nyu-with-scorsese.html|work=Vulture|publisher=New York Magazine|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=October 28, 2013}}</ref> (the same year, he had a small acting role in comedy ''[[The Battle of Love's Return]]'').<ref>M.J. Simpson [http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/interviews/lloydkaufmana.html Interview with Lloyd Kaufman].</ref> Stone made a short, well received 12 minute film ''Last Year in Viet Nam''. He worked as a taxi driver, film production assistant, messenger, and salesman before making his mark in film as a scriptwriter in the late 70s, in the period between his first two films as a director: horror films ''[[Seizure (film)|Seizure]]'' and ''[[The Hand (film)|The Hand]]''.

In 1979, Stone won his first Academy Award, after adapting true-life jail tale ''[[Midnight Express (book)|Midnight Express]]'' into a hit film for British director [[Alan Parker]] (the two would later collaborate on a 1996 movie of stage musical ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'').  Stone's screenplay for ''Midnight Express'' was criticized by some for its inaccuracies in portraying the events described in the book and vilifying the Turkish people. The original author, [[Billy Hayes (writer)|Billy Hayes]], around whom the film is set, spoke out against the film, protesting that he had many Turkish friends while in jail.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/156011_midnightexpress.html |title=The real Billy Hayes regrets 'Midnight Express' cast all Turks in a bad light |publisher=Seattlepi.com |date=January 10, 2004 |accessdate=August 13, 2010 |first1=John |last1=Flinn}}</ref> Stone later apologized to Turkey for over-dramatizing the script, while not repudiating the film's stark brutality or the reality of Turkish prisons.<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/2005-01-06/news/oliver-stone-apologizes-to-turkey/ Oliver Stone Apologizes to Turkey]</ref>

===1980s===
Stone wrote further features, including [[Al Pacino]]'s drug lord tale ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[Year of the Dragon (film)|Year of the Dragon]]'' with [[Mickey Rourke]],  before his career took off as a writer-director in 1986. Stone has either written or co-written most of the films he has directed. In 1986, Stone directed two films back to back: the critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'', shot largely in Mexico, and his long in development Vietnam project ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', shot in the Philippines. Stone loosely based ''Scarface'' on his own addiction to [[cocaine]], which he successfully kicked while writing the screenplay.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-total-film-interview-oliver-stone |title=The Total Film Interview&nbsp;— Oliver Stone |publisher=[[Total Film]]|date=November 1, 2003|accessdate=October 15, 2008}}</ref>

''Platoon'' brought Stone's name to a much wider audience. It also finally kickstarted a busy directing career, which saw him making nine films over the next decade. Alongside some negative reaction, ''Platoon'' won many rave reviews ([[Roger Ebert]] later called it the ninth best film of the 1980s), large audiences, and Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. In 2007, a film industry vote ranked it at number 83 in an [[American Film Institute]] "[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]]" poll of the previous century's best American movies. British TV channel [[Channel 4]] voted ''Platoon'' as the sixth greatest war film ever made.<ref>{{cite web|title=Channel 4's 100 Greatest War Movies of All Time |url=http://www.thependragon.co.uk/Channel4WarFilms.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2011}}</ref>

''Platoon'' was the first of three films Stone has made about the [[Vietnam War]]: the others were ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' and ''[[Heaven & Earth (1993 film)|Heaven & Earth]]'', each dealing with different aspects of the war. ''Platoon'' is a semi-autobiographical film about Stone's experience in combat; ''Born on the Fourth of July'' is based on the [[Born on the Fourth of July|autobiography]] of US Marine turned peace campaigner [[Ron Kovic]]; ''Heaven & Earth'' is based on the memoir ''[[When Heaven and Earth Changed Places]]'', in which [[Le Ly Hayslip]] recalls her life as a Vietnamese village girl drastically affected by the war and who finds another life in the USA.

Stone also directed the acclaimed ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', which won [[Michael Douglas]] an Academy Award for Best Actor as a ruthless Wall Street corporate raider, and ''[[Talk Radio (film)|Talk Radio]]'', based on [[Eric Bogosian]]'s Pulitzer-nominated play.

===1990s===
''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', released in 1991, received criticism from former Doors member [[Ray Manzarek]] (keyboardist–bass player) during a question and answer session at Indiana University East (in Richmond, Indiana), in 1997. During the discussion, Manzarek stated that he sat down with Stone about [[The Doors]] and [[Jim Morrison]] for over 12 hours. [[Patricia Kennealy Morrison]]—a well known rock critic and author—was a consultant on the movie, in which she also has a cameo appearance, but she writes in her memoir ''[[Strange Days: My Life With and Without Jim Morrison]]'' (Dutton, 1992) that Stone ignored everything she told him and proceeded with his own version of events. From the moment the movie was released, she blasted it as untruthful and inaccurate.<ref>"She Slams 'Doors' on Portrayal," ''[[New York Post]]'', (March 1991)</ref>  The other surviving former members of the band, [[John Densmore]] and [[Robby Krieger]], also cooperated with the filming of ''Doors'', but Krieger distanced himself from the work before the film's release. However, Densmore thought highly of the film, and in fact celebrated its DVD release on a panel with Oliver Stone.

During this same period, Stone directed one of his most ambitious, controversial and successful films to date, ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', that depicts the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963. In 1991, Stone showed ''JFK'' to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on [[Capitol Hill]], which helped lead to passage of the Assassination Materials Disclosure Act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d102:SJ00282:@@@D&summ2=m& |title=Bill Summary & Status - 102nd Congress (1991 - 1992) - S.J.RES.282 - CRS Summary&nbsp;— THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}</ref> of 1992. The [[Assassination Records Review Board]] (created by Congress to end the secrecy surrounding Kennedy's assassination) discussed the film, including Stone's observation at the end of the film, about the dangers inherent in government secrecy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/advisory/arrb98/index.html |title=Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board |publisher=Fas.org |date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}</ref> Stone published an annotated version of the screenplay, in which he cites references for his claims, shortly after the film's release.

1994 saw the release of Stone's satire of the modern media, ''[[Natural Born Killers]]''. Originally based on a screenplay by [[Quentin Tarantino]], critics recognized its portrayal of violence and the intended satire on the media. Before it was released, the MPAA gave the film a NC-17 rating; this caused Stone to cut four minutes of film footage in order to obtain an R rating (he eventually released the unrated version on VHS and DVD in 2001).

Stone went on to direct the 1995 [[Richard Nixon]] biopic ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', which was nominated for Oscars for script and [[Anthony Hopkins]]' portrait of the title role. Stone followed ''Nixon'' with the 1997 road movie/film noir, ''[[U Turn (1997 film)|U Turn]]'' and 1999's ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'', a film about power struggles within and without an [[American football]] team.

===2000s===
[[File:Oliver stone, Rino Barillari, The king of paparazzi.jpg|thumb|right|Oliver Stone with Rino Barillari in "Piazza dé Ricci" exit of the restaurant "Pierluigi" in [[Rome]] – September 25, 2012]]
After a period from 1986–1999 where Stone released a new film at least every 1–2 years, Stone slowed down in the 2000s, though still finding some success.

In 2004, Stone directed the critically savaged ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]''. He later radically re-edited his [[biopic]] of [[Alexander the Great]] into a two-part, 3 hour 37 minute film ''Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut'', which became one of the highest-selling catalog items from Warner Bros.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=247524742023620&id=137199066350088 Alexander – Words from Oliver Stone: Thank you very much...]. Facebook. Retrieved on May 22, 2014.</ref> After ''Alexander'', Stone went on to direct ''[[World Trade Center (film)|World Trade Center]]'', based on the true story of two [[Port Authority Police Department|PAPD]] policemen who were trapped in the rubble and survived the [[September 11 attacks]].

In 2007, Stone was intended to direct his fourth Vietnam War film ''[[Pinkville]]'', about a Pentagon investigation into the [[My Lai Massacre]] of Vietnamese civilians. The film was to have been made for [[United Artists]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldstein |first=Gregg |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ia69b7a31e057937e0ebb482e4bc5440a |title=Stone headed to 'Pinkville' along with UA |publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com |date=August 28, 2007 |accessdate=September 30, 2010}} {{dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> but the company officially cancelled the production start due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]]. Shortly after the strike, Stone went on to write and direct the [[George W. Bush]] biopic ''[[W. (film)|W.]]'', that chronicles the controversial President's childhood, relationship with his father, struggles with his alcoholism, rediscovery of his Christian faith, and continues the rest of his life up until the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

===2010s===
In 2010, Stone returned to the theme of ''Wall Street'' for the sequel ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373159/ |title=Money Never Sleeps |work=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}</ref> More recently, Stone directed ''[[Savages (2012 film)|Savages]]'', based on a novel by [[Don Winslow]].

==Documentaries==
[[File:Hugo Chavez, Oliver Stone 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra) 8.jpg|thumb|Stone with Hugo Chávez at the [[Venice International Film Festival]], July 9, 2009 for the screening of ''South of the Border'']]
Stone made three documentaries on [[Fidel Castro]]: ''[[Comandante]]'' (2003), ''[[Looking for Fidel]]'', and ''Castro in Winter'' (2012). He made ''[[Persona Non Grata (film)|Persona Non Grata]]'', a documentary on Israeli-Palestinian relations, interviewing several notable figures of Israel, including [[Ehud Barak]], [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], and [[Shimon Peres]], as well as [[Yasser Arafat]], leader of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].

In 2009, Stone completed a feature-length documentary, ''[[South of the Border (2009 film)|South of the Border]]'' about the rise of progressive, leftist governments in Latin America, featuring seven presidents: [[Hugo Chávez]] of [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]]'s [[Evo Morales]], [[Ecuador]]'s Correa, [[Cuba]]'s [[Raúl Castro]], the Kirchners of Argentina, [[Brazil]]'s [[Lula da Silva]], and [[Paraguay]]'s [[Fernando Lugo]] (all of whom hold negative views of US manipulations in South America). Stone hoped the film would get the [[Western world]] to rethink socialist policies in South America, particularly as it was being applied by Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. Chávez joined Stone for the premiere of the documentary at the [[Venice International Film Festival]] in September 2009.<ref>

The documentary was also released in several cities in the United States and Europe in the summer of 2010.<ref name="chavezstone">[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i01kwRMeMjF3BBfsv1lSiLoWNXMgD9G08FL02 Stone: Film an intro to Chávez and his movement], by Ian James, Associated Press, May 29, 2010</ref><ref>

==Other work==
In 1993, Stone produced a [[miniseries]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] called ''[[Wild Palms]]''. In a cameo, Stone appears on a television in the show discussing how the theories in his film ''JFK'' had been proven correct (the series took place in a hypothetical future, 2007). That same year, he also spoofed himself in the comedy hit ''[[Dave (film)|Dave]]'', espousing an (accurate) [[conspiracy theory]] about the film President's replacement by a near-identical double. In 1997, Stone published ''A Child's Night Dream'' (St. Martin's Press), a semiautobiographical novel first written in 1966–1967.

In 2008, Stone was named the Artistic Director of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts Asia in Singapore.

Stone married three times, first to Najwa Sarkis on May 22, 1971. They divorced in 1977. He then married Elizabeth Burkit Cox, an assistant in film production, on June 7, 1981.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=AZSG19XFvwIC&pg=PR8&dq=%22OLIVER+STONE%22+ELIZABETH&cd=1 |title=Oliver Stone: Interviews&nbsp;— Oliver Stone, Charles L.

Stone is mentioned in [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning American author [[Lawrence Wright]]'s book ''[[Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief]]'' as having been a member of [[Scientology]] for about a month, saying "It was like going to college and reading [[Dale Carnegie]], something you do to find yourself."<ref>[http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2013/01/nine-celebrity-morsels-lawrences-wrights-scientology-book/61122/ Nine Celebrity Morsels from Lawrence's Wright's Scientology Book]</ref>  In 1997, Stone was one of 34 celebrities to sign an open letter to then-German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], published as a newspaper advertisement in the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', which protested against the treatment of [[Scientology in Germany|Scientologists in Germany]] and compared it to the [[Nazi]]s' oppression of [[Jew]]s in the 1930s.<ref name=Droz>Drozdiak, William (January 14, 1997).

In 1999, Stone was arrested and pleaded guilty to alcohol and drug charges. He was ordered into a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation program]]. He was arrested again on the night of May 27, 2005 in [[Los Angeles]] for possession of an undisclosed illegal drug.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/28/stone.arrest/index.html |title=Director Oliver Stone arrested |publisher=[[CNN News]]|date=May 28, 2005|accessdate=October 15, 2008}}</ref><ref name="Director Oliver Stone arrested">{{cite news|title=Director Oliver Stone arrested|date=May 28, 2005|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2005-05-28/entertainment/stone.arrest_1_drug-charges-stone-s-mercedes-director-oliver-stone?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ | work=CNN}}</ref>  He was released the next day on a $15,000 bond.<ref name="Director Oliver Stone arrested"/> In August 2005, Stone pled no contest and was fined $100.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oliver Stone enters plea in pot charge|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-08-11-stone-plea_x.htm | work=USA Today | date=August 11, 2005}}</ref>

==Political views==

===Latin America===
Stone has had an interest in [[Latin America]] since the 1980s when he made his 1986 film ''[[Salvador (film)|Salvador]]'' and later returned to make his documentary ''South of the Border'' about the left-leaning movements that had been taking hold in the region.  He has expressed the view that these movements are a positive step toward political and economic autonomy for the region.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/22/AR2010062204929.html |title=Director Stone leaves no passion unstoked, and Silverdocs film is no exception |author=Ann Hornaday |publisher=Washington Post |date=June 23, 2010 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref>

In 2007, Stone was in Venezuela making a documentary. At that time, [[Operation Emmanuel]], a third-party international negotiation to free three hostages held for over six years was ongoing. Venezuela's then president [[Hugo Chávez]] had proposed and set up the negotiations with the Colombian revolutionary guerrilla group [[FARC]] as part of the [[humanitarian exchange]] affair. Chávez's plan was supported by the governments of Argentina, Brazil, France, Ecuador and Bolivia, as well as the Red Cross which also participated in the operation.<ref name = "Newsweek2008">{{cite news| url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/needtoknow/2008/01/how_washington_fails_colombia.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Need to Know}}</ref><ref name = "CEPR">{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-&-columns/op-eds-&-columns/latin-america-news-coverage-half-the-story-is-worse-than-none |title=Latin America News Coverage: Half the Story is Worse Than None |publisher=Cepr.net |date=February 1, 2008 |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}</ref> 
In the days before the 2007 New Year's Eve, the Venezuelan government had arranged for the release of high-profile hostages held by FARC in the Colombian jungle, but the release was delayed, and Stone blamed the Colombian government and the United States for the fiasco. As he waited for the exchange, Stone described Chavez as a "great man" and explained his remark:<ref name = "Observer2008"/>

:"Because he's really made a difference. You sense a revolutionary spirit throughout Venezuela. He doesn't seem like a tyrant to me at all, he doesn't seem even like a strongman, he seems like a man who respects the law. He's abided by the constitution far faster than Bush has abided by our constitution."<ref name = "Observer2008"/>

In a January 2008 interview with ''[[The Observer]]'', given shortly after these events, Stone expressed support for Colombian group [[FARC]] and said:

:"I do think that by the standards of Western civilization they (FARC) go too far; they kidnap innocent people. On the other hand, they're fighting a desperate battle against highly financed, American-supported forces who have been terrorizing the countryside for years and kill most of the people. FARC is fighting back as best it can and grabbing hostages is the fashion in which they can finance themselves and try to achieve their goals, which are difficult. They're a peasant army; I see them as a Zapata-like army. I think they are heroic to fight for what they believe in and die for it, as was Castro in the hills of Cuba."<ref name = "Observer2008">''The Observer'', "Stone: My Part in Baby Hostage Drama," January 6, 2008.</ref>

===US Presidential politics===
According to ''Newsmeat'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' respectively, Stone voted for [[Barack Obama]] as [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] in both the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] and [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]] elections, instead of [[John McCain]] and [[Mitt Romney]], the GOP candidates for the presidency.<ref name="Schou">{{cite web|last=Schou|first=Solvej|title=Oliver Stone on Obama: 'I hope he wins'|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/11/06/oliver-stone-obama-presidential-election/|publisher=Entertainment Weekly Inc.|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>  Stone was quoted as saying at the time: ''"I voted for Obama because...I think he's an intelligent individual I think he responds to difficulties well...very bright guy...far better choice yes."''<ref name="Oliver Stone On Voting For Obama">{{cite web|title=Oliver Stone On Voting For Obama|url=http://on.aol.com/video/oliver-stone-on-voting-for-obama-517521814|publisher=AOL Inc.|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> In 2012, Stone endorsed [[Ron Paul]] for the Republican nomination for President. He said that Paul is "the only one of anybody who's saying anything intelligent about the future of the world."<ref>{{cite news|title=Director Oliver Stone On History.

===Iran and Holocaust controversy===
In an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper on July 25, 2010, Stone claimed that America does not know "the full story" on Iran and complained about Jewish "domination" in parts of the U.S. media and foreign policy, notably his view that [[Adolf Hitler]] was misunderstood due to Jewish control of the media.<ref name="jpost" /> When Stone was asked why so much of an emphasis has been placed on the [[Holocaust]], as opposed to the 20-plus million casualties the [[Soviet Union]], for example, suffered in [[World War II]], he stated that in Washington the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC) was an overly powerful Jewish lobby within the U.S. The remarks were heavily criticized by Jewish groups, including the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], from which Yuri Eidelstein described Stone's remarks as what "could be a sequel to the ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''"),<ref name="jpost">{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/ArtsAndCulture/Entertainment/Article.aspx?id=182659|publisher=The Jerusalem Post|title=Israel slams Oliver Stone's interview|first=Gil|last=Hoffman}}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Committee]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=ijITI2PHKoG&b=2818289&ct=8540509&notoc=1|publisher=[[American Jewish Committee]] - [http://www.ajc.org Website]|title=AJC: "Oliver Stone has Outed Himself as an Anti-Semite"|accessdate=July 26, 2010}}</ref> as well as from Israel's Diaspora Affairs and Public Diplomacy Minister.<ref name="jpost"/>

A day later, Stone stated: "In trying to make a broader historical point about the range of atrocities the Germans committed against many people, I made a clumsy association about the Holocaust, for which I am sorry and I regret. Jews obviously do not control media or any other industry. The fact that the Holocaust is still a very important, vivid and current matter today is, in fact, a great credit to the very hard work of a broad coalition of people committed to the remembrance of this atrocity—and it was an atrocity."<ref name="wsj">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/07/26/oliver-stone-sorry-about-holocaust-comments|work=The Wall Street Journal|title=Oliver Stone 'Sorry' About Holocaust Comments|date=July 26, 2010}}</ref>

Two days later, Stone issued a second apology to the Anti-Defamation League ([[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]]), which was accepted. "I believe he now understands the issues and where he was wrong, and this puts an end to the matter," said ADL National Director Abraham Foxman.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i7deb554f2e0e8b2f2fc5625de5900b25|work=The Hollywood Reporter|title=Oliver Stone, ADL settle their differences|first=Georg|last=Szalai|date=October 14, 2010}}</ref>

===WikiLeaks===
Oliver Stone is a vocal supporter of [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]]. Stone signed a petition in support of Assange's bid for political asylum in June 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Moore, Glover, Stone, Maher, Greenwald, Wolf, Ellsberg Urge Correa to Grant Asylum to Assange|date=June 22, 2012|url=http://www.justforeignpolicy.org/node/1257 | work=Just Foreign Policy}}</ref> In August 2012, he penned a [[New York Times]] op-ed with filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] on the importance of WikiLeaks and free speech.<ref>{{cite news|title=WikiLeaks and Free Speech|date=August 20, 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/opinion/wikileaks-and-the-global-future-of-free-speech.html | work=The New York Times}}</ref> Stone visited Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in April 2013 and commented, "I don't think most people in the US realize how important WikiLeaks is and why Julian's case needs support." He also criticized two upcoming WikiLeaks films from [[Alex Gibney]] and [[Bill Condon]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Oliver Stone meets Julian Assange and criticises new WikiLeaks films|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/apr/11/oliver-stone-julian-assange-wikileaks | work=The Guaridan | date=April 11, 2013|location=London|first=Ben|last=Child}}</ref>

In June 2013, Stone and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for [[Chelsea Manning]].<ref>[http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/celebrity-bradley-manning-video-93041.html#ixzz2WgfpNmys Celeb video: 'I am Bradley Manning' - Patrick Gavin].

Retrieved on May 22, 2014.</ref>

===Ukraine===
In December 2014, Stone made statements supporting the Russian government's narrative on Ukraine, portraying the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] as a CIA plot and former Ukrainian president (who was ousted as a result of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution) [[Viktor Yanukovych]], whom new Ukrainian authorities accuse of the murder of over a hundred [[List of people killed during Euromaidan|protesters]], as a legitimate president forced to leave Ukraine by "well-armed, [[neo-Nazi]] radicals."<ref name=Mash141230>{{cite news |url= http://mashable.com/2014/12/30/oliver-stone-ukraine-viktor-yanukovych/ |title= Oliver Stone says CIA was behind Ukraine revolution in bizarre Facebook rant |first= Christopher |last= Miller |work= [[Mashable]] |date= December 30, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.newsweek.com/oliver-stone-meets-toppled-ukrainian-president-accuses-cia-sparking-coup-295814 |title=Oliver Stone Meets Toppled Ukrainian President Yanukovych, Accuses CIA of Sparking Coup |publisher= Newsweek }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-12-31/oliver-stone-patron-saint-of-truthiness |title= Oliver Stone, Patron Saint of Truthiness |work= Bloomberg View }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/oliver-stone-interviews-yanukovych-for-documentary-on-u-s-coup-in-ukraine/514013.html |title= Oliver Stone Interviews Yanukovych for Documentary on U.S. 'Coup' in Ukraine |work= The Moscow Times }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/oliver-stone-ukraines-revolution-was-cia-plot-1481412 |title= Oliver Stone: Ukraine's revolution was CIA 'plot' |work= International Business Times }}</ref><ref name=RonPaul>{{cite news |url= http://www.ronpaulinstitute.org/archives/peace-and-prosperity/2015/january/01/oliver-stone-cia-fingerprints-all-over-ukraine-coup |title=CIA Fingerprints All Over Ukraine Coup |publisher= Ron Paul institute}}</ref> The [[University of Toronto]]'s Stephen Velychenko, the author of several books on Ukrainian history, and James Kirchick of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' criticized Stone's comments and plans for a film.<ref name=KP150101>{{cite news |url= http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/letters/stephen-velychenko-an-open-letter-to-oliver-stone-376557.html |title= Stephen Velychenko: An open letter to Oliver Stone |first= Stephen |last= Velychenko |publisher= [[Kyiv Post]] |date= January 1, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=DB150105>{{cite news |url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/05/oliver-stone-s-latest-dictator-suckup.html |title= Oliver Stone’s Latest Dictator Suckup |first= James |last= Kirchick |work= [[The Daily Beast]] |date= January 5, 2015 }}</ref>
