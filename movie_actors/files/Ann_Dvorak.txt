'''Ann Dvorak''' (August 2, 1911 &ndash; December 10, 1979) was an American film actress.

Asked how to pronounce her adopted surname, she told ''[[Literary Digest|The Literary Digest]]'': "My name is properly pronounced ''vor'shack''. The ''D'' remains silent. I have had quite a time with the name, having been called practically everything from Balzac to Bickelsrock."<ref>{{cite book|first=Charles Earle|last=Funk|title=What's the name, please?

==Life and career==
'''Anna McKim''' was born in New York City in 1911 to silent film actress [[Anna Lehr]] and actor/director [[Edwin McKim]].  She made her film debut when she was five years old in the silent film version of "Ramona" (1916) and was credited "Baby Anna Lehr".  She continued in children's roles in "The Man Hater" (1917) and "Five Dollar Plate" (1920) but then stopped acting in films.  Her parents separated in 1916 and divorced in 1920, and she didn't see her father again until 13 years later when she made a public plea to the press to help her find him.  In the late 1920s she worked as a dance instructor and gradually began to appear on film as a chorus girl. Her friend [[Karen Morley]] introduced her to [[Howard Hughes]], who groomed her as a dramatic actress. She was a success in such [[pre-Code]] films as ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932) as [[Paul Muni]]'s sister; in ''[[Three on a Match]]'' (1932) with [[Joan Blondell]] and [[Bette Davis]] as the doomed, unstable Vivian, in ''[[Love Is a Racket]]'' (1932) and in ''[[Sky Devils]]'' (1932) opposite [[Spencer Tracy]].  Known for her style and elegance, she was a popular leading lady for [[Warner Brothers]] during the 1930s, and appeared in numerous contemporary romances and melodramas.

She eloped in July 1932 with [[Leslie Fenton]], her English co-star from [[The Strange Love of Molly Louvain]] (1932), and left for a year-long honeymoon without giving adequate notice to the studio and in spite of her contractual obligations. This led to a period of litigation and pay dispute during which she discovered she was making the same amount of money as the boy who played her son in ''Three on a Match''. She completed her contract on permanent suspension and then worked as a freelancer, but although she worked regularly, the quality of her scripts declined sharply.

She appeared as secretary [[Della Street]] to [[Donald Woods (actor)|Donald Woods]]' [[Perry Mason]] in ''[[The Case of the Stuttering Bishop]]'' (1937). She also acted on Broadway. With her then-husband, [[Leslie Fenton]], Dvorak traveled to England where she supported the war effort by working as an ambulance driver, and appeared in several British films. She appeared as a saloon singer in ''[[Abilene Town]]'', released in 1946.  Her marriage to Fenton ended in divorce in 1946.  In 1947, she married her second husband, Igor Dega, a Russian dancer who danced with her briefly in [[The Bachelor's Daughters]].  It ended in divorce two years later.

She retired from the screen in 1951, when she married her third and last husband, Nicholas Wade, to whom she remained married until his death in 1975. She had no children.  In 1959, she and her husband moved to Hawaii, a place she had always loved, and she lived in near-anonymity until her death from stomach cancer in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] at the age of 68. <ref> Honolulu Star-Bulletin, October 14, 1965 </ref> She was cremated and her ashes scattered.  She had no survivors.

Ann Dvorak has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for her contribution to Motion Pictures, at 6321 Hollywood Boulevard.
