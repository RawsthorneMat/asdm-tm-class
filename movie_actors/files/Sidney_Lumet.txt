'''Sidney Arthur Lumet''' ({{IPAc-en|l|uː|ˈ|m|ɛ|t}} {{respell|loo|MET|'}}; June 25, 1924&nbsp;– April 9, 2011) was an American director, producer and screenwriter with over 50 films to his credit. He was nominated for the [[Academy Award]] as [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957), ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'' (1975), ''[[Network (film)|Network]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Verdict]]'' (1982). He did not win an individual Academy Award, but he did receive an [[Academy Honorary Award]] and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as ''Network'', which was nominated for ten, winning four.

''The Encyclopedia of Hollywood'' states that Lumet was one of the most prolific directors of the modern era, making more than one movie per year on average since his directorial debut in 1957.<ref name=Siegel/> He was noted by [[Turner Classic Movies]] for his "strong direction of actors," "vigorous storytelling" and the "social realism" in his best work.<ref name=TCM>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=117539&apid=140633 "TCM Biography"]</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] described him as having been "one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors."<ref name=Chicago>Ebert, Roger.

A founding member of New York's [[Actors Studio]],<ref>{{cite book|quote=Lewis' class included Herbert Berghof, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Mildred Dunnock, Tom Ewell, John Forsythe, Anne Jackson, Sidney Lumet, Kevin McCarthy, Karl Malden, E.G.

His first movie was typical of his best work: a well-acted, tightly written, deeply considered "problem picture," ''12 Angry Men'' (1957).  From that point on Lumet divided his energies among other idealistic problem pictures along with literate adaptations of plays and novels, big stylish pictures, New York-based black comedies, and realistic crime dramas, including ''[[Serpico]]'' and ''[[Prince of the City]]''. As a result of directing ''12 Angry Men'', he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Messina|first=Elizabeth|title=What's His Name?

In 2005, Lumet received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his "brilliant services to screenwriters, performers, and the art of the motion picture." Two years later, he concluded his career with the acclaimed drama ''[[Before the Devil Knows You're Dead]]'' (2007). A few months after Lumet's death in April 2011, a retrospective celebration of his work was held at New York's [[Lincoln Center]] with the appearance of numerous speakers and film stars.<ref name=Lincoln>Fleming, Mike.

==Early years==
[[File:Lumet-1940-LOC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lumet in the 1940 play, ''Journey to Jerusalem'']]

In 1935, aged 11, he appeared in a [[Henry Lynn]] short film, ''Papirossen'' (meaning "Cigarettes" in Yiddish), co-produced by radio star [[Herman Yablokoff]]. The film was shown in a theatrical play with the same title, based on a hit song, "Papirosn". The play and short film appeared in the Bronx McKinley Square Theatre.<ref>''Bridge of Light (Yiddish Film Between Two Worlds)'', pp. 208, 209, J.

In 1939, [[World War II]] interrupted his early acting career, and he spent three years with the [[U.S. Army]]. After returning from [[World War II]] service (1942–1946) as a radar repairman stationed in [[India]] and [[Burma]], he became involved with the [[Actors Studio]], and then formed his own theater workshop. He organized an [[Off-Broadway]] group and became its director, and continued directing in [[summer stock theatre]], while teaching acting at the High School of Performing Arts.<ref name=Katz/> He was the senior drama coach at the new 46th St. (Landmark) building of "Performing Arts' ("Fame").

==Career in directing==

===Early career===
[[File:Lumet-TV-1953.jpg|thumb|left|Directing a TV show in 1953]]
Lumet began his career as a director with [[Off-Broadway]] productions and then evolved into a highly respected TV director. After working off-Broadway and in summer-stock, he began directing television in 1950, after working as an assistant to friend and then-director [[Yul Brynner]]. He soon developed a "lightning quick" method for shooting due to the high turnover required by television. As a result, while working for [[CBS]] he directed hundreds of episodes of ''[[Danger (TV series)|Danger]]'' (1950–55), ''[[Mama (TV series)|Mama]]'' (1949–57), and ''[[You Are There (series)|You Are There]]'' (1953–57), a weekly series which co-starred [[Walter Cronkite]] in one of his earliest leading roles. He chose Cronkite for the role of anchorman "because the premise of the show was so silly, was so outrageous, that we needed somebody with the most American, homespun, warm ease about him," Lumet said.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/walter-cronkite/about-walter-cronkite/561/ "Walter Cronkite – In Memoriam 1916–2009"] ''PBS'', July 20, 2009</ref>

He also directed original plays for ''[[Playhouse 90]]'', ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'' and ''[[Westinghouse Studio One|Studio One]]'', filming around 200 episodes, which established him as "one of the most prolific and respected directors in the business," according to [[Turner Classic Movies]]. His ability to work quickly while shooting carried over to his film career.<ref name=TCM/> Because the quality of many of the television dramas was so impressive, several of them were later adapted as motion pictures.
[[File:Lumet-Magnani-1959.jpg|thumb|Directing [[Anna Magnani]] in ''[[The Fugitive Kind]]'' (1959)]]
His first movie, ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'', was an auspicious beginning for Lumet. It was a critical success and established Lumet as a director skilled at adapting theatrical properties to motion pictures. For [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor]], seeing the film for the first time, became a "pivotal moment" in her life, as she was at that time considering a career in law. "It told me that I was on the right path," she said.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/nyregion/18sonia.html?scp=1&sq=Movie%20Supreme%20Court%20Sotomayor&st=cse "The Movie That Made a Supreme Court Justice"], ''New York Times'', October 17, 2010</ref> Fully half of Lumet's complement of films have originated in the theater.<ref name=Bowles/>

A controversial TV show he directed in 1960 gained him notoriety: ''The Sacco-Vanzetti Story'' on [[NBC]]. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "the drama drew flack from the state of [[Massachusetts]] (where [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] were tried and executed) because it was thought to postulate that the condemned murderers were, in fact, wholly innocent. But the brouhaha actually did Lumet more good than harm, sending several prestigious film assignments his way.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/1548245/Sidney-Lumet/biography|title=Sidney Lumet biography|publisher=Movies.nytimes.com|date=June 25, 1924|accessdate=April 11, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Lumet-Brando-1959.jpg|thumb|left|Directing [[Marlon Brando]] in ''The Fugitive Kind'' (1959)]]

He began adapting classic plays for both film and television. In 1959, he directed [[Marlon Brando]], [[Joanne Woodward]] and [[Anna Magnani]] in the feature film ''[[The Fugitive Kind]]'', based on the [[Tennessee Williams]] play ''[[Orpheus Descending]]''. He later directed a [[The Iceman Cometh (1960 TV production)|live television version]] of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]'', which was followed by his 1962 film, ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'', another psychological drama from a [[A View from the Bridge|play]] written by [[Arthur Miller]]. This was followed by another Eugene O'Neill [[Long Day's Journey Into Night|play]] turned to cinema, ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night (1962 film)|Long Day's Journey into Night]]'', in 1962, with [[Katharine Hepburn]] gaining an Oscar nomination for her performance as a drug-addicted housewife; the four principal actors swept the acting awards at the [[1962 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="festival-cannes.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3166/year/1962.html|title=Festival de Cannes: Long Day's Journey into Night|accessdate=February 23, 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> It was also voted one of the year's "Ten Best Films" by ''The New York Times''.

===Directing style and subjects===

====Realism and energetic style====
Film critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] has observed that Lumet was a "hardboiled straight-shooter," who, because he was trained during the golden Age of television in the 1950s, became noted for his energetic style of directing. The words "Sidney Lumet" and "energy," he adds, became synonymous: "The energy was there in the quietest moments. It was an inner energy, a hum of existence that Lumet observed in people and brought out in them. . . [when he] went into the New York streets . . . he made them electric:<ref name=EW1>{{cite news|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/04/09/rip-sidney-lumet/|title=Sidney Lumet was the quintessential New York filmmaker, a prince of the city who captured our flawed souls|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|date=April 9, 2011|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}</ref>
{{quote|It was a working class outer-borough energy. Lumet's streets were just as mean as Scorsese's, but Lumet's seemed plain rather than poetic. He channeled that New York skeezy vitality with such natural force that it was easy to overlook what was truly involved in the achievement. He captured that New York vibe like no one else because he saw it, lived it, breathed it – but then he had to go out and stage it, or re-create it, almost as if he were staging a documentary, letting his actors square off like random predators, insisting on the most natural light possible, making offices look as ugly and bureaucratic as they were because he knew, beneath that, that they weren't just offices but lairs, and that there was a deeper intensity, almost a kind of beauty, to catching the coarseness of reality as it truly looked.<ref name=EW1/>}}

====Collaboration====
[[File:Lumet-Treat Williams - 1981.jpg|thumb|250px|Describing scene with [[Treat Williams]] in ''[[Prince of the City]] (1981)]]
Lumet generally insisted on the collaborative nature of film, sometimes ridiculing the dominance of the "personal" director, writes film historian Frank P. Cunningham. As a result, Lumet became renowned among both actors and cinematographers "for his flexibility in the sharing of creative ideas with the writer, actor, and other artists."<ref name=Cunningham>Cunningham, Frank R. ''Sidney Lumet: Film and Literary Vision'', Univ. Press of Kentucky (1991, 2001) p. 7</ref> According to Cunningham, Lumet "has no equal in the distinguished direction of superior actors," many coming from the theater. He was thereby able to draw "remarkable performances" from acting luminaries such as [[Ralph Richardson]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[James Mason]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]], [[Blythe Danner]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Vanessa Redgrave]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Albert Finney]], [[Simone Signoret]], and [[Anne Bancroft]]. "Give him a good actor, and he just might find the great actor lurking within", wrote film critic [[Mick LaSalle]].<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/04/15/MVK41IV2RU.DTL&type=movies "Director Sidney Lumet a hero of man battling pack"], ''SFGate'', April 15, 2011</ref>

When necessary, Lumet would choose untrained actors, but stated, "over ninety percent of the time I want the best tools I can get: actors, writers, lighting men, cameramen, propmen."<ref name=Cunningham/> Nonetheless, when he did use less "fully dimensional" actors in the cast of his film, he was still able to bring out superior and memorable acting performances, as he did with [[Nick Nolte]], [[Anthony Perkins]], [[Armand Assante]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Faye Dunaway]], [[Timothy Hutton]] and [[Ali MacGraw]], who herself referred to him as "every actor's dream."<ref name=WSJ/> In Fonda's opinion, "he was a master. Such control of his craft. He had strong, progressive values and never betrayed them."<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/jane-fonda-remembers-kind-and-generous-sidney-lumet_1211949 "Jane Fonda Remembers 'Kind And Generous' Sidney Lumet"] ''Contactmusic.com'', April 11, 2011</ref>

Lumet believed that movies are an art and once stated that "The amount of attention paid to movies is directly related to pictures of quality."<ref name=Harpole>Harpole, Charles, and Schatz, Thomas. ''History of the American Cinema: A New Pot of Gold'', Simon and Schuster (2000)</ref> Because he started his career as an actor, he became known as an "actor's director," and worked with the best of them over the years, a roster probably unequaled by any other director."<ref name=Rapf/> Acting scholar Frank P. Tomasulo agrees, and points out that many directors who are able to understand acting from an actor's perspective, were all "great communicators."<ref>Tomasulo, Frank P. ''More than a Method: Trends and Traditions in Contemporary Film Performance'', Wayne State Univ. Press (2004) p. 64</ref>

According to film historians [[Gerald Mast]] and Bruce Kawin, Lumet's "sensitivity to actors and to the rhythms of the city have made him America's longest-lived descendant of the 1950s [[Neorealism (art)|Neorealist]] tradition and its urgent commitment to [[ethics|ethical]] responsibility."<ref name=Mast>Mast, Gerald, and Kawin, Bruce F. ''A Short History of the Movies'' (2006) Pearson Education, Inc. 538</ref> They cite his early film ''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'' (1965) as "one of the most politically and morally radical films of the 1960s."

They add that beneath the social conflicts of Lumet's films lies the "conviction that love and reason will eventually prevail in human affairs," and that "law and justice will eventually be served&nbsp;– or not."<ref name=Mast/> His debut film, ''Twelve Angry Men'', was an acclaimed picture in its day: it was a model for liberal reason and fellowship in the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] era; or maybe it was an alarming example of how easily any jury could be swayed."<ref name=Thomson/> The film and its director were nominated for Academy Awards. Lumet was nominated for the [[Directors Guild of America|Director's Guild]] Award and the film was widely praised by critics.<ref name=Katz/>

The ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'' states that his films often featured actors who studied "[[Method acting]]", "characterized by an earthy, introspective style. A leading example of such "Method" actors would be [[Al Pacino]], who, early in his career, studied under Method acting guru [[Lee Strasberg]]. Lumet also preferred the appearance of spontaneity in both his actors and settings, an "improvisational look achieved by shooting much of his work on location."<ref name=EWB>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Gale|first=Thomson|title=Sidney Lumet|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography}}</ref>

====Rehearsal and preparation====
Lumet was a strong believer in rehearsal, and felt that if you rehearse correctly the actor will not lose spontaneity. According to acting author Ian Bernard, he felt that it gives actors the "entire arc of the role," which gives them the freedom to find that "magical accident."<ref>Bernard, Ian. ''Film and Television Acting: From Stage to Screen'', Focal Press (1998)</ref> Director [[Peter Bogdanovich]] asked him whether he rehearsed extensively before shooting, and Lumet replied "I like to rehearse a minimum of two weeks before I shoot."<ref name=Rapf/>

He was able to prepare and execute a production in rapid order, allowing him to consistently stay within a modest budget. When filming ''[[Prince of the City]]'', for example, although there were over 130 speaking roles and 135 different locations, he was able to coordinate the entire shoot in 52 days.  As a result, write historians [[Charles Harpole]] and Thomas Schatz, performers were eager to work with him as they considered him to be an "outstanding director of actors." And they note that "whereas many directors disliked rehearsals or advising actors on how to build their character, Lumet excelled at both."<ref name=Harpole/> As a result, he was able to give his performers a cinematic showcase for their abilities and help them deepen their acting contribution. Actor [[Christopher Reeve]], who co-starred in ''[[Deathtrap (film)|Deathtrap]]'', also pointed out that Lumet "knows how to talk technical language&nbsp;– if you want to work that way&nbsp;– he knows how to talk [[Method acting|Method]], he knows how to improvise, and he does it all equally well."<ref name=Rapf/>

Joanna Rapf, writing about the filming of ''The Verdict'', states that Lumet gave a lot of personal attention to his actors, "listening to them, touching them." She describes how Lumet and star [[Paul Newman]] sat on a bench secluded from the main set, where Newman had taken his shoes off, in order to privately discuss an important scene about to be shot. . . . The actors walk through their scenes before the camera rolls. This preparation was done because Lumet likes to shoot a scene in one take, two at the most. "I call him "Speedy Gonzales," the only man I know who'll double-park in front of a whorehouse," kids Paul Newman privately. "He's arrogant about not shooting more than he has to. He doesn't give himself any protection. I know I would," Newman adds.<ref name=Rapf/> Film critic Betsey Sharkey agrees, adding that "he was a maestro of one or two takes years before Clint Eastwood would turn it into a respected specialty."  Sharkey recalls, "[Faye] Dunaway once told me that Lumet worked so fast it was as if he were on roller skates. A racing pulse generated by a big heart."<ref>Sharkey, Betsey. [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-sidney-lumet-20110411,0,750875.story "Lumet was drawn to the messy business of simply being human"], ''Los Angeles Times'', April 11, 2011</ref>

====Character development====
Biographer Joanna Rapf observes that Lumet had always been an "independent director," and liked to make films about "men who summon courage to challenge the system, about the little guy against the system."<ref name=Rapf/>{{rp|Intro}} This also includes the women characters in his films, such as ''[[Garbo Talks]]''. "[[Anne Bancroft]] embodies the kind of character to whom Lumet is attracted&nbsp;– a committed activist for all kinds of causes, who stands up for the rights of the oppressed, who is lively, outspoken, courageous, who refuses to conform for the sake of convenience, and whose understanding of life allows her to die with dignity&nbsp;... ''Garbo Talks'' in many ways is a valentine to New York."<ref name=Rapf/>

Throughout a 2006 interview, he reiterated that "he is fascinated by the human cost involved in following passions and commitments, and the cost those passions and commitments inflict on others." This theme is at the "core" of most of his movies, notes Rapf, "including his stories of corruption in the [[New York City Police Department]] and family dramas such as in ''Daniel''.

====Psychodramas====
[[File:Lumet-Caine-1982.jpg|thumb|Directing [[Michael Caine]] in the suspense thriller ''Deathtrap'' (1982)]]
According to film historian Stephen Bowles, Lumet proved himself "most comfortable and effective as a director of serious [[psychodrama]]s and was most vulnerable when attempting light entertainments. His Academy Award nominations, for example, were all for character studies of men in crisis, from his first film, ''Twelve Angry Men'', to ''The Verdict''. Lumet was, literally, a child of the drama." He notes that "nearly all the characters in Lumet's gallery are driven by obsessions or passions that range from the pursuit of justice, honesty, and truth to the clutches of jealousy, memory, or guilt. It is not so much the object of their fixations but the obsessive condition itself that intrigues Lumet."<ref name=Bowles>Bowles, Stephen E. ''International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers'', (2001) The Gale Group Inc.</ref>

Therefore, Bowles adds, "Lumet's protagonists tend to be isolated, unexceptional men who oppose a group or institution. Whether the protagonist is a member of a jury or party to a bungled robbery, he follows his instincts and intuition in an effort to find solutions. Lumet's most important criterion is not whether the actions of these men are right or wrong but whether the actions are genuine. If these actions are justified by the individual's conscience, this gives his heroes uncommon strength and courage to endure the pressures, abuses, and injustices of others. [[Frank Serpico]], for example, is the quintessential Lumet hero in his defiance of peer group authority and the assertion of his own code of moral values."<ref name=Bowles/> Lumet in his autobiography described the film [[Serpico]] as "a portrait of a real rebel with a cause."<ref name=Lumet/>

====Issues of social justice====
[[Turner Classic Movies]] states that "it was the social realism which permeated his greatest work that truly defined Lumet &nbsp;– the themes of youthful idealism beaten down by corruption and the hopelessness of inept social institutions allowed him to produce several trenchant and potent films that no other director could have made."<ref name=TCM/> ''Serpico'' (1973) was the first of four "seminal" films he made in the 1970s that marked him as "one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation."  It was the story of power and betrayal in the New York City police force, and was coupled with the "idea that innocence is lost in the face of corruption." The movie became a blueprint that Lumet would use to portray the inner world of cops, lawyers and street criminals, with only an "idealistic lone wolf battling seemingly impossible odds."<ref name=TCM/>

"As a child of the [[Great Depression|Depression]]," writes Joanna Rapf, "growing up poor in New York City with poverty and corruption all around him, Lumet became concerned with the importance of justice to a democracy. He says he likes questioning things, people, institutions, what is considered by society as 'right' and 'wrong.'"<ref name=Rapf/> He admits, however, that he does not believe that art itself has the power to change anything. "There is, as he says, a lot of 'shit' to deal with in the entertainment industry, but the secret of good work is to maintain your honesty and your passion."<ref name=Rapf/>

Film historian David Thomson writes "He has steady themes: the fragility of justice, and the police and their corruption." He adds, "Lumet quickly became esteemed&nbsp;... [and he] got a habit for big issues&nbsp;– ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail-Safe]],'' ''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]],'' ''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]],''&nbsp;– and seemed torn between dullness and pathos. ...&nbsp;''Network'' ...&nbsp; was the closest he had come to a successful comedy. He was that rarity of the 1970s, a director happy to serve his material&nbsp;– yet seemingly not touched or changed by it. ...&nbsp;His sensitivity to actors and to the rhythms of the city have made him "America's longest-lived descendant of the 1950s Neorealist tradition and its urgent commitment to ethical responsibility."<ref name=Thomson>Thomson, David. "A Biographical Dictionary of Film" (1995) Alfred A. Knopf, 459</ref>

Lumet, discussing one of his primary film subjects, police corruption, described his feelings for film magazine, ''Cinema Nation'':
{{cquote|I have just finished a movie called ''[[Prince of the City]]''. It's a long, complex film and one of the most difficult and satisfying movies I've ever made. It's about a cop informing on other cops&nbsp;... [It's] not only about informing, however. It is also about cops and the complexity of their lives. I've known a lot of cops, most of whom join the force with a good deal of idealism. They wind up with the highest suicide and alcoholism rates of any profession.<ref name=Lumet>Lumet, Sidney. ''Cinema Nation'' (2000) Avalon Publishing, pgs. 271–275</ref>}}

====New York City settings====
Lumet always preferred to work in New York, noted Lumet biographer Joanna Rapf, "shunning the dominance of Hollywood. By refusing to "go Hollywood," he soon became strongly identified with New York and filmed the majority of his films there. Like [[Woody Allen]], he defined himself as a New Yorker. "I always like being in Woody Allen's world," he said. He claimed "the diversity of the City, its many ethnic neighborhoods, its art and its crime, its sophistication and its corruption, its beauty and its ugliness, all feed into what inspires him."<ref name=Rapf>Rapf, Joanna E. ''Sidney Lumet: Interviews'', Univ. Press of Mississippi (2006)</ref> He felt that in order to create it is important to confront reality on a daily basis. For Lumet, "New York is filled with reality; Hollywood is a fantasyland."<ref name=Rapf/>

He used New York time and again as the backdrop&nbsp;– if not the symbol&nbsp;– of his "preoccupation with America's decline," according to film historians [[Scott Siegel|Scott and Barbara Siegel]].<ref name=Siegel>Siegel, Scott and Barbara. ''The Encyclopedia of Hollywood'' (2004) Checkmark Books, 256</ref> In discussing the significance of urban settings to Lumet, Bowles notes, "Within this context, Lumet is consistently attracted to situations in which crime provides the occasion for a group of characters to come together. Typically these characters are caught in a vortex of events they can neither understand nor control but which they must work to resolve."<ref name=Bowles/>

In a 2007 interview with ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, he was asked, "Almost all of your films&nbsp;– from ''The Pawnbroker'' to your latest&nbsp;– have an intense level of that famous New York grit. Is being streetwise really such a difference between us and Hollywood?" Lumet replied: "In L.A., there's no streets! No sense of a neighborhood! They talk about us not knowing who lives in the same apartment complex as us&nbsp;– bullshit! I know who lives in my building. In L.A., how much can you really find out about anybody else? ...&nbsp;Really, it's just about human contact. It seems to me that our greatest problems today are coming out of the increasing isolation of people, everywhere."<ref name=NYMag>{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/movies/filmfestivals/newyork/2007/38027/|title=Q&A With 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' Director Sidney Lumet|date=September 24, 2007|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|accessdate=April 10, 2011}}</ref>

====Use of contemporary Jewish themes====
Like those of other [[Jewish]] directors from New York, such as [[Woody Allen]], [[Mel Brooks]], and [[Paul Mazursky]], Lumet's characters often spoke overtly about controversial issues of the times. They felt unconstrained as filmmakers and their art became "filtered through their Jewish consciousness," notes film historian [[David Desser]]. Lumet, like the others, sometimes turned to Jewish themes in order to develop ethnic sensibilities that were characteristic of contemporary American culture,<ref name=Desser>Desser, David; Friedman, Lester D. ''American Jewish Filmmakers'', Univ. of Illinois Press (2004)</ref>{{rp|3}} by dynamically highlighting its "unique tensions and cultural diversity." This was partly reflected in Lumet's preoccupation with city life.<ref name=Desser/>{{rp|6}} His film ''[[A Stranger Among Us]]'', for example, is the story of a woman undercover police officer and her experiences in a [[Hasidic]] community within New York City.

The subject of "guilt," explains Desser, dominates many of Lumet's films. From his first feature film, ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957), in which a jury must decide the guilt or innocence of a young man, to ''[[Q&A (film)|Q & A]]'' (1990), in which a lawyer must determine the question of guilt and responsibility on the part of a maverick policeman, "guilt," writes Desser, "links the diverse parts of Lumet's varied and complex canon." Whereas in films like ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974), all of the suspects are guilty.<ref name=Desser/>{{rp|172}}

His films were also characterized by a strong emphasis on tensions within the "family," with his apparent "insistence on the centrality of family life."<ref name=Desser/>{{rp|172}} This emphasis on the family also included "surrogate families," as in the police trilogy, ''Serpico'' (1973), ''Prince of the City'' (1981), and ''[[Q&A (film)|Q&A]]''.  An "untraditional family" is also inherent in ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'' (1975).<ref name=Desser/>{{rp|172}}

====Directing techniques====
Lumet had always preferred naturalism and/or realism, according to Joanna Rapf. He did not like the "decorator's look"; rarely did he want "the camera to call attention to itself; the editing must be unobtrusive." His cinematographer, [[Ron Fortunato]], said "Sidney flips if he sees a look that's too artsy."<ref name=Rapf/>

Partly because he was willing and able to take on so many significant social issues and problems, "he can deliver powerhouse performances from lead actors, and fine work from character actors," writes film historian Thomson. He is "one of the stalwart figures of New York moviemaking. He abides by good scripts, when he gets them."<ref name=Thomson/>

According to Katz's ''Film Encyclopedia,'' "Although critical evaluation of Lumet's work wavered widely from film to film, on the whole the director's body of work has been held in high esteem. Critical opinion has generally viewed him as a sensitive and intelligent director who possesses considerable good taste, the courage to experiment with a variety of techniques and styles, and an uncommon gift for handling actors."<ref name=Katz/> Lumet, unlike some other directors, tried to keep a professional distance from his actor's personal lives: "[[Elia Kazan]] used to really try to get inside the head and psyche of everybody he worked with," Lumet told The New York Times in 2007, referring to the influential director. "I'm the exact opposite school. I don't like to get involved."<ref name=WXEL>[http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wxel/news.newsmain/article/0/0/1787079/Arts..and..Culture/Prolific.American.film.director.Sidney.Lumet.dies "Prolific American film director Sidney Lumet dies"], WXEL, April 9, 2011</ref>

In a quote from his book, Lumet emphasized the logistics of directing:
{{cquote|Someone once asked me what making a movie was like. I said it was like making a mosaic. Each setup is like a tiny tile (a setup, the basic component of a film's production, consists of one camera position and its associated lighting). You color it, shape it, polish it as best you can. You'll do six or seven hundred of these, maybe a thousand. (There can easily be that many setups in a movie.) Then you literally paste them together and hope it's what you set out to do.<ref>Lumet, Sidney. "Making Movies" (1996) Vintage Books, 58</ref>}}

In 1970, Lumet said, "If you're a director, then you've got to direct&nbsp;... I don't believe that you should sit back and wait until circumstances are perfect before you and it's all gorgeous and marvelous&nbsp;... I never did a picture because I was hungry&nbsp;... Every picture I did was an active, believable, passionate wish. Every picture I did I wanted to do&nbsp;... I'm having a good time."

Lumet, in a statement posted on [[IMDB]], said, "If I don't have a script I adore, I do one I like. If I don't have one I like, I do one that has an actor I like or that presents some technical challenge." Critic Justin Chang adds that Lumet's skill as a director and in developing strong stories, continued up to his last film in 2007, noting that his "nimble touch with performers, his ability to draw out great warmth and zesty humor with one hand and coax them toward ever darker, more anguished extremes of emotion with the other, was on gratifying display in his ironically titled final film, ''[[Before the Devil Knows You're Dead]].''"<ref>Chang, Justin. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118035221?refCatId=13 "Lumet weighed society's failings"], ''Variety'', April 10, 2011</ref>

====Vision of future films====
In the same interview with ''New York'' magazine, when asked what he foresaw as the next wave of filmmaking, he responded, "Well, we were shooting out in [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]], and one day I was watching all these kids standing outside a school near the studio. It was just marvelous: [[Indian people|Indian]] girls in [[sari]]s, kids from [[Pakistan]], [[Korea]], kids from all over. So I think you'll see more directors from these communities, telling their stories. You know, I started out making films about Jews and [[Italian Americans|Italians]] and [[Irish Americans|Irish]] because I didn't know anything else."<ref name=NYMag/>

==Death==
Lumet died at the age of 86 on April 9, 2011, in his residence in Manhattan, from [[lymphoma]].<ref name="BBC obit"/><ref name="NYT obit" /> When asked in a 1997 interview about how he wanted to "go out," Lumet responded, "I don't think about it. I'm not religious. I do know that I don't want to take up any space. Burn me up and scatter my ashes over [[Katz's Delicatessen]]."<ref name=NYTimesMagazine>[http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/magazine/sunday-november-23-1997-questions-for-sidney-lumet.html Questions for Sidney Lumet], ''The New York Times Magazine'', November 23, 1997</ref>

Following his death, numerous tributes have been paid for his enduring body of work, marked by many memorable portrayals of New York City. Fellow New York directors [[Woody Allen]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] both paid tribute to Lumet. Allen called him the "quintessential New York film-maker", while Scorsese said "our vision of the city has been enhanced and deepened by classics like ''Serpico'', ''Dog Day Afternoon'' and, above all, the remarkable ''Prince of the City''."<ref name="remembered">{{cite news|title=Director Sidney Lumet remembered by Hollywood stars|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13028378|accessdate=April 10, 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=April 10, 2011}}</ref> Lumet also drew praise from New York mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], who called him "one of the great chroniclers of our city".<ref name="remembered"/>

Lumet was called "the last of the great movie moralists" in a tribute remembering a career in which he "guided many of the world's most respected actors through roles that connected with the conscience of multiple generations."<ref name=FatherhoodChannel/>

==Legacy==
According to film historian Bowles, Lumet succeeded in becoming a leading drama filmmaker partly because "his most important criterion [when directing] is not whether the actions of his protagonists are right or wrong, but whether their actions are genuine." And where those actions are "justified by the individual's conscience, this gives his heroes uncommon strength and courage to endure the pressures, abuses, and injustices of others." His films have thereby continually given us the "quintessential hero acting in defiance of peer group authority and asserting his own code of moral values."<ref name=Bowles/>

[[File:SidneyLumet07TIFF.jpg|thumb|Lumet at the [[2007 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
Lumet's published memoir about his life in film, ''Making Movies'' (1996), is "extremely lighthearted and infectious in its enthusiasm for the craft of moviemaking itself," writes Bowles, "and is in marked contrast to the tone and style of most of his films. Perhaps Lumet's signature as a director is his work with actors&nbsp;– and his exceptional ability to draw high-quality, sometimes extraordinary performances from even the most unexpected quarters"<ref name=Bowles/> Jake Coyle, ''[[Associated Press]]'' writer, agrees: "While Lumet has for years gone relatively underappreciated, actors have consistently turned in some of their most memorable performances under his stewardship. From [[Katharine Hepburn]] to [[Faye Dunaway]], [[Henry Fonda]] to [[Paul Newman]], Lumet is known as an actor's director,"<ref>Coyle, Jack. AP Worldstream, February 28, 2005</ref> and to some, like [[Ali MacGraw]], he is considered "every actor's dream."<ref name=WSJ>[http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/01/15/ali-macgraw-reflects-on-her-career-in-front-of-the-camera/ "Ali MacGraw Reflects on Her Career in Front of the Camera"], Wall Street Journal, January 15, 2011</ref>

[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy of Motion Pictures]] President [[Frank Pierson]] said, "Lumet is one of the most important film directors in the history of American cinema, and his work has left an indelible mark on both audiences and the history of film itself."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/dec/16/awardsandprizes.news |title=Sidney Lumet gets honorary Oscar |publisher=Guardian |date= December 16, 2004|accessdate=April 11, 2011 |location=London}}</ref> ''[[Boston Herald]]'' writer James Verniere observes that "at a time when the American film industry is intent on seeing how low it can go, Sidney Lumet remains a master of the morally complex American drama."<ref>Verniere, James. "Moral Complexity Remains Director Sidney Lumet's Speciality," ''The Boston Herald'', May 16, 1997</ref>

Noting that Lumet's "compelling stories and unforgettable performances were his strong suit," director and producer [[Steven Spielberg]] believes that Lumet was "one of the greatest directors in the long history of film."<ref name=HR>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/steven-spielberg-remembers-sidney-lumet-176905 "Steven Spielberg Remembers Sidney Lumet"], ''Hollywood Reporter'', April 11, 2011</ref> [[Al Pacino]], upon hearing of Lumet's death, stated that with his films, "he leaves a great legacy, but more than that, to the people close to him, he will remain the most civilized of humans and the kindest man I have ever known."<ref name=HR/>

He did not win an individual Academy Award, although he did receive an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 2005 and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as ''Network'', which was nominated for 10, winning 4. In 2005, Lumet received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his "brilliant services to screenwriters, performers, and the art of the motion picture." Upon winning recognition from the Academy, Lumet said, "I wanted one, damn it, and I felt I deserved one."<ref name=FatherhoodChannel>[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/04/10/sidney-lumet-last-of-the-great-movie-moralists-410/ "Sidney Lumet: Last of the Great Movie Moralists"], FatherhoodChannel.com, April 10, 2011</ref> Nonetheless, director [[Spike Lee]] commented that "his great work lives on with us forever. Much more important than Oscar. Ya-dig?"<ref>[http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/2011/04/10/appreciating_sidney_lumet_obits_spike_lee_tweets_photos_and_clips/ "Appreciating Sidney Lumet; Obits, Spike Lee Tweets, Photos and Clips"], Indiewire.com, April 10, 2011</ref>

A few months after Lumet's death in April 2011, TV commentator [[Lawrence O'Donnell]] aired a tribute to Lumet,<ref>[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/lawrence-odonnells-tribute-to-director-sidney-lumet-includes-an-f-bomb/ "Lawrence O’Donnell’s Tribute To Director Sidney Lumet Includes An F-Bomb"], ''Mediaite.com", June 27, 2011</ref> and a retrospective celebration of his work was held at New York's [[Lincoln Center]] with the appearance of numerous speakers and film stars.<ref name="Lincoln" /> In October 2011, the organization [[Human Rights First]] inaugurated its "Sidney Lumet Award for Integrity in Entertainment" for the TV show, ''The Good Wife,'' along with giving awards to two Middle East activists who had worked for freedom and democracy. Lumet had worked with Human Rights First on a media project related to the depiction of torture and interrogation on television.<ref>[http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/2011/09/27/the-good-wife-wins-sidney-lumet-award-for-integrity-in-entertainment/ "The Good Wife Wins Sidney Lumet Award for Integrity in Entertainment"] ''Human Rights First'', press release, September 27, 2011</ref>

Sight & Sound magazine conducts a poll every ten years to publish a list called the Ten Greatest Films of All Time. In 2012 [[David Michod]], [[PJ Hogan]] and [[Cyrus Frisch]] voted for "Network". Frisch commented: "Even Berlusconi might have learned a few things about the power of the media watching this film."<ref>http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/920</ref> ''Network'' was listed as the 224th best film.<ref>http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b6b15b9f7</ref>
