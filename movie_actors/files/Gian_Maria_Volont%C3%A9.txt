'''Gian Maria Volonté''' (9 April 1933 – 6 December 1994) was an [[Italy|Italian]] actor. He is perhaps most famous outside of [[Italy]] for his roles as the main villain in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (credited in the USA as "Johnny Wels") and ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''. In Italy, he was more notable for his roles in high-profile social dramas depicting the political and social stirrings of Italian and European society in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Early life==
Volonté was born in [[Milan]], and graduated in [[Rome]] in 1957. He had a brief career as a television and theatre ([[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Carlo Goldoni|Goldoni]]) actor, before concentrating on his film career. 

==Career==
He made his debut in [[1960 in film|1960]] in ''[[Sotto dieci bandiere]]'', directed by [[Duilio Coletti]]. Just four years later, Volonté played "Ramón Rojo" in ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]), and "El Indio" in ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' ([[1965 in film|1965]]), both for cash reasons as he did not consider either role seriously. Both films were directed by the then-unknown [[Sergio Leone]], and Volonté's roles in them would bring him his greatest recognition from American audiences.  Many consider his greatest film acting role to have been his stunning portrayal of Carlo Levi in the film ''[[Cristo si é fermato a Eboli]]'' (1979), which was based on Levi's autobiographical account of his years in internal-exile in Italy in the 1930s. The English book and film title: Christ Stopped at Eboli.  He also played the memorable role of the Bandito-turned-guerrilla, El Chucho, in ''[[A Bullet for the General]]'' (1966).

His performances as memorable but neurotic characters, or as a gifted leader of brigands or revolutionaries, together with the unexpected, worldwide success of the films, gave him international fame. Volonté had already played comedies, including ''[[A cavallo della tigre]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]), by [[Luigi Comencini]], and confirmed his versatility in ''[[L'armata Brancaleone]]'' (1966). However, he found his main dimension in dramatic roles for ''[[Banditi a Milano]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]), by [[Carlo Lizzani]], ''[[Sbatti il mostro in prima pagina]]'' (1972) by [[Marco Bellocchio]], ''[[La Classe operaia va in paradiso]]'' (1972) by his friend [[Elio Petri]] and ''[[Il sospetto]]'' ([[1975 in film|1975]]) by [[Francesco Maselli]].

In 1968 he won a Silver Ribbon as best actor for ''[[A ciascuno il suo]]'', also directed by [[Elio Petri]]. Volonté received the same award for two other performances: Petri's ''[[Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]], winner of an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] as best foreign film), considered by many to be his finest; and in ''[[The Abyss (1988 film)|The Abyss]]'' ([[1989 in film|1989]]). In [[1983 in film|1983]] he won the award for [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]] at the [[1983 Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[La Mort de Mario Ricci]]''. Four years later, at the [[37th Berlin International Film Festival]], he won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actor]] for ''[[The Moro Affair|Il caso Moro]]''.<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1987/03_preistr_ger_1987/03_Preistraeger_1987.html |title=Berlinale: 1987 Prize Winners |accessdate=2011-02-27 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> [[1988 Cannes Film Festival Official Selection]], remarkable play as a Renaissance physician in ''[[The Abyss (1988 film)|The Abyss]]'' by [[André Delvaux]] from [[The Abyss (Marguerite Yourcenar novel)|Marguerite Yourcenar's famous novel]].  In [[1990 in film|1990]] he was declared best European actor for ''[[Porte aperte]]''. In [[1991 in film|1991]], at the [[Venice Film Festival]], he won a [[Golden Lion]] for his career as a whole.

Volonté also played numerous roles outside Italy.

==Personal life==
He was a strong political activist and known for his left-leaning views. Companion of Italian actress [[Carla Gravina]] for almost 10 years, they met when they played ''Romeo and Juliet'' in the theatre in 1960. The two had a daughter Giovanna, born in the early 1960s.

The actress {{ill|it|Angelica Ippolito}} was his companion from 1977 until his death in 1994.

==Death==
He died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1994 at [[Florina]], [[Greece]] during the filming of ''[[Ulysses' Gaze]]'', directed by [[Theo Angelopoulos]]. His role in the film was recast to [[Erland Josephson]].

As he asked, Volonté's final resting place is a small cemetery on the [[Sardinia]]n island of [[La Maddalena|Isola della Maddalena]].
