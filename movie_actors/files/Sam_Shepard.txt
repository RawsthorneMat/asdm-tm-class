He is the author of several books of short stories, essays, and memoirs, and received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 1979 for his play ''[[Buried Child]]''.

Shepard received the [[PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award]] as a master American dramatist in 2009.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
[[File:Sam Shepard.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Shepard at the age of 21.]]
Born Samuel Shepard Rogers III in [[Fort Sheridan, Illinois]], he worked on a ranch as a teenager. His father, Samuel Shepard Rogers, Jr., was a teacher and farmer who served in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a [[bomber]] [[aviator|pilot]] during [[World War II]]; Shepard has characterized him as "a drinking man, a dedicated [[alcoholic]]".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2003/oct/11/theatre.music | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=John | last=O'Mahony | title=The write stuff | date=October 11, 2003}}</ref> His mother, Jane Elaine (née Schook), was a teacher and a native of Chicago, Illinois.<ref>{{cite web | title=Sam Shepard Biography | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/84/Sam-Shepard.html | work=filmreference | year=2008 | accessdate=November 25, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= Petri Liukkonen; Ari Pesonen | title=Sam Shepard | url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/sshepard.htm | publisher=Pegasos | year=2008 | accessdate=February 16, 2009}}</ref>

After graduating from [[Duarte High School]] in 1961, he briefly studied [[agriculture]] at [[Mt. San Antonio College]], where he became enamored with the oeuvre of [[Samuel Beckett]], [[jazz]], and [[abstract expressionism]]. Shepard soon dropped out to join a touring repertory group, the Bishop’s Company.

===Career===
After securing a position as a busboy at [[The Village Gate]] upon arriving in [[New York City]], Shepard became involved in the [[Off-Off-Broadway|Off-Off-Broadway theater]] scene in 1962 through Ralph Cook, the club's head waiter. Although his plays would go on to be staged at several Off-Off-Broadway venues, he was most closely connected with Cook's [[Theatre Genesis]], housed at [[St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery]] in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. Most of his initial writing was for the stage;<ref>[[Gary Botting]], ''The Theatre of Protest in America'', Edmonton: Harden House, 1972.</ref> after winning six [[Obie Awards]] between 1966-1968, Shepard emerged as a viable [[screenwriter]] with [[Robert Frank]]'s ''[[Me and My Brother (film)|Me and My Brother]]'' (1968) and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' (1970). Several of Shepard's early plays (including ''Red Cross'' [1966] and ''[[La Turista]]'' [1967]) were directed by [[Jacques Levy]]. A habitué of the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] scene of the era, he contributed to [[Kenneth Tynan]]'s ribald ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'' (1969) and drummed sporadically from 1967 through 1971 with [[psychedelic folk]] band [[The Holy Modal Rounders]], appearing on ''[[Indian War Whoop]]'' (1967) and ''[[The Moray Eels Eat The Holy Modal Rounders]]'' (1968).

Shepard's early [[science fiction]] play ''The Unseen Hand'' (1969) would influence [[Richard O'Brien]]'s [[musical theatre|stage musical]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''. ''[[Cowboy Mouth (play)|Cowboy Mouth]]''—a collaboration with then-lover, [[Patti Smith]]—was staged for one night at [[The American Place Theater]] in April 1971, providing early exposure for the future [[punk rock]] singer. After ending his relationship with Patti Smith, Shepard relocated with his wife and son to [[London]] in the early 1970s. Returning to America in 1975, he moved to the 20-acre Flying Y Ranch in [[Mill Valley, California]] where he raised a young colt named Drum and used to ride double with his young son on an appaloosa named Cody. He wrote plays out of his house and served for a semester as Regents' Professor of Drama at the [[University of California, Davis]].
Shepard accompanied [[Bob Dylan]] on the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] of 1975 as the ostensible screenwriter of the surrealist ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'' (1978) that emerged from the tour; because much of the film was improvised, Shepard's services were seldom utilized. His diary of the tour (''Rolling Thunder Logbook'') was published by [[Penguin Books]] in 1978. A decade later, Dylan and Shepard co-wrote the 11-minute "[[Brownsville Girl]]", included on Dylan's ''[[Knocked Out Loaded]]'' (1986) album and later compilations.

In 1975, he was named [[artist in residence|playwright-in-residence]] at the [[Magic Theatre]], where many of his notable works (including his [[Family Trilogy]]: ''[[Buried Child]]'' [1978], ''[[Curse of the Starving Class]]'' [1978], and ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'' [1980]) received their premier productions.<ref name="Simard">Simard, Rodney. “American Gothic: Sam Shepard's Family Trilogy.” ''Theatre Annual'' 41 (1986): 21–36.</ref> Some critics expand this grouping to a quintet which includes ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'' (1983) and ''[[A Lie of the Mind]]'' (1985).<ref name="Roudané">Roudané, Matthew (2002). ''The Cambridge Companion to Sam Shepard.'' Cambridge University Press, ISBN 9780521777667</ref>

Shepard began his acting career in earnest when he was cast as the handsome land baron in [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[Days of Heaven]]'' (1978), opposite [[Richard Gere]] and [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]]. This led to other important films and roles, including the role of "Cal", Ellen Burnstyn's love interest in the film "Resurrection" (1980) and most notably his portrayal of [[Chuck Yeager]] in ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' (1983), earning him an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].  By 1986, one of his plays, ''[[Fool for Love (play)|Fool for Love]]'', was being made into a film directed by [[Robert Altman]], in which Shepard played the lead role; his play ''[[A Lie of the Mind]]'' was [[Off Broadway|Off-Broadway]] with an all-star cast including [[Harvey Keitel]] and [[Geraldine Page]]; he was living with [[Jessica Lange]]; and he was working steadily as a film actor—all of which put him on the cover of ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine.

Throughout the years, Shepard has done a considerable amount of teaching on writing plays and other aspects of theatre.  His classes and seminars have occurred at various theatre workshops, festivals, and universities.

Shepard was elected to [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 1986. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1986.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter S|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterS.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}</ref>

In 2000, Shepard decided to repay a debt of gratitude to the Magic Theatre by staging his play ''[[The Late Henry Moss]]'' as a benefit in San Francisco.  The cast included [[Nick Nolte]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Woody Harrelson]], and [[Cheech Marin]].  The limited, three-month run was sold out.

In 2001, Shepard had a notable role of General [[William F. Garrison]] in the box office hit movie ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]].'' Although he was cast in a supporting role, it reinvigorated interest in Shepard among the public and critics alike.

He performed [[Spalding Gray]]'s final monologue ''Life Interrupted'' for its audio release through Macmillan Audio in 2006.

In 2007, Shepard contributed [[banjo]] to Patti Smith's cover of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s song "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" on her album ''[[Twelve (Patti Smith album)|Twelve]]''.
Although many artists have had an influence on Shepard's work, one of the most significant has been actor-director [[Joseph Chaikin]], a veteran of the [[Living Theatre]] and founder of a group called the Open Theatre.  The two have often worked together on various projects, and Shepard acknowledges that Chaikin has been a valuable mentor.

A revival of ''A Lie of the Mind'' in New York<ref>[http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/theater/reviews/19lie.html?8dpc "THEATER REVIEW: Home Is Where the Soul Aches"] by [[Ben Brantley]], ''The New York Times'', February 19, 2010. Retrieved 2010-02-19.</ref> was staged at the same time as his 2010 play, ''Ages of the Moon'', also opened there. Reflecting on the two plays, Shepard said that the older, longer play feels to him "awkward ...[, a]ll of the characters are in a fractured place, broken into pieces, and the pieces don’t really fit together," while the newer play "is like a [[Porsche]]. ... It’s sleek, it does exactly what you want it to do, and it can speed up but also shows off great brakes."<ref name="NYT02">Patrick Healy, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/13/theater/13shepard.html "Getting Faster With Age: Sam Shepard’s New Velocity"], ''The New York Times'', February 12, 2010 (Feb 13, 2010, on p. C1 of NY ed.). Retrieved 2010-02-13.</ref> The revival and new play also coincided with the publication of the collection ''Day out of Days: Stories'' (book title echoing a [[Day Out of Days|film-making term]]), also by Shepard.<ref>[[Walter Kirn]], [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/books/review/Kirn-t.html?ref=theater "Sam Shepard: The Highwayman"] Review of ''Day out of Days: Stories'' by Sam Shepard 282 pp. (Alfred A.

Retrieved 2010-02-13.</ref> The book includes "short stories, poems and narrative sketches ... that developed from dozens of leather-bound notebooks [Shepard] has carried with him over the years."<ref name="NYT02" /> In 2011, Shepard starred in the film ''[[Blackthorn (film)|Blackthorn]]''.

====Directing====
At the beginning of his playwriting career, Shepard did not direct his own plays.  His earliest plays were directed by a number of different directors but most frequently by Ralph Cook, the founder of Theatre Genesis.  Later, while living at the Flying Y Ranch in Mill Valley, just north of San Francisco, Shepard formed a successful playwright-director relationship with Robert Woodruff, who directed the premiere of ''[[Buried Child]]'' (1982), among other plays.  During the 1970s, though, Shepard decided that his vision of his plays required that he should direct them himself.  He has since directed many of his own plays, but with a few rare exceptions, he has not directed plays by other playwrights.  He has also directed two films but apparently does not see film direction as a major interest.

===Personal life===
When Shepard first arrived in New York, he roomed with Charlie Mingus Jr., a friend from his high school days and the son of [[jazz]] musician [[Charles Mingus]]. Then he lived with actress Joyce Aaron. From 1969 to 1984, he was married to actress [[O-Lan Jones]], with whom he has one son, Jesse Mojo Shepard (born 1970).  In 1970-71, Shepard was involved in an [[extramarital affair]] with [[Patti Smith]], who remained unaware of Shepard's identity as a multiple [[Obie Award]]-winning playwright until it was finally divulged to her by [[Jackie Curtis]]. According to Smith, "Me and his wife still even liked each other. I mean, it wasn't like committing [[adultery]] in the [[suburbs]] or something."{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Shepard met [[Academy Award|Academy-Award]]-winning actress [[Jessica Lange]] on the set of the film ''[[Frances (film)|Frances]]'', in which they were both acting. He moved in with her in 1983, and they were together for nearly 30 years; they separated in 2010.<ref>Johnson, Zach.
