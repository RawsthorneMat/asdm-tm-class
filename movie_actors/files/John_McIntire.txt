'''John Herrick McIntire''' (June 27, 1907 – January 30, 1991) was an [[United States|American]] [[character actor]].<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', February 4, 1991.</ref> McIntire replaced [[Ward Bond]] for the starring role on ''[[Wagon Train]]'' as the second trail master, Christopher Hale (a role he played from early 1961 to the series' ending in 1965).

==Career==
The craggy-faced film actor was born in [[Spokane, Washington]] but reared near [[Eureka, Montana]]. He grew up around ranchers and [[cowboy]]s, an experience that would later inspire his performances in dozens of film and television [[Western (genre)|westerns]]. A graduate of [[University of Southern California|USC]], McIntire began acting in radio on ''Tarzan and The Diamond of Asher'', where he met his future wife, [[Jeanette Nolan]]. He was the voice in the radio program ''[[The March of Time]]''—and then on stage, before he embarked on a lengthy film and television career as a character actor. He was already forty when he made his big-screen debut in 1947, but went on to appear in some sixty-five films, often playing police chiefs, judges, eccentric loners, or other western characters. {{cn|date=September 2013}}

His films include the [[film noir]] classic ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]'' (1950), the 1960 Hitchcock thriller ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the 1960 drama ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]'', but some of his more memorable roles were in westerns such as the acclaimed ''[[Winchester '73]]'' (1950) and  ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1955), both with [[James Stewart]], and ''[[The Tin Star]]'', with [[Henry Fonda]] (1957). 

McIntire actually received top billing for perhaps his best film role, as a crusading politician in ''[[The Phenix City Story]]'' (1955), even though he played a supporting part. 

He played [[Isaac Parker|Federal Judge Isaac Parker]] in ''[[Rooster Cogburn (film)|Rooster Cogburn]]'' (1975), the sequel to ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' featuring [[John Wayne]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]]. His final film role was in ''[[Turner & Hooch]]'' (1989).

In the mid-1950s, McIntire moved into television, appearing in anthology series, sitcoms and dramas. He guest starred as Judson in the episode "Chinese Invasion" of [[NBC]]'s western series ''[[Cimarron City (TV series)|Cimarron City]]'', with [[George Montgomery (actor)|George Montgomery]] and [[John Smith (actor)|John Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/Western/CimarronCity.htm|title=''Cimarron City''|publisher=ctva.biz|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}</ref> 

McIntire procured a regular role on  [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', before his character was killed off. Though McIntire had never had the lead role in a film, television provided him with his most prominent and long-running role when in 1961 he replaced the late [[Ward Bond]] in the popular NBC/ABC series ''[[Wagon Train]]'', playing trailmaster Chris Hale in more than 150 episodes between 1961 and 1965. His co-stars were [[Robert Horton (actor)|Robert Horton]], [[Robert Fuller (actor)|Robert Fuller]], [[Denny Miller|Denny Scott Miller]], [[Terry Wilson (actor)|Terry Wilson]], [[Frank McGrath (actor)|Frank McGrath]], and [[Michael Burns (actor and historian)|Michael Burns]]. Even before ''Wagon Train'', McIntire was cast from January to May 1961 in the supporting role of Pa Canfield in the NBC [[American Civil War]] drama ''[[The Americans (1961 TV series)|The Americans]]'', starring [[Darryl Hickman]] and [[Richard Davalos]] as brothers who fight on opposites of the conflict.

In 1960, McIntire guest starred as William Palmer in the series finale, "The Most Dangerous Gentleman", of the short-lived NBC western ''[[Overland Trail (TV series)|Overland Trail]]'', starring [[William Bendix]] and [[Doug McClure]], his subsequent co-star on ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]''. In [[1967 in television|1967]], he guest starred in an episode of CBS's ''[[Dundee and the Culhane]]''.

McIntire subsequently replaced actors [[Lee J. Cobb]] and [[Charles Bickford]] on NBC's ''The Virginian'' in 1967, having played the brother of Bickford's character.

===Marriage and work with wife===
In 1935, McIntire married actress [[Jeanette Nolan]], and the couple had two children together, one of whom was the actor [[Tim McIntire]] (1944–1986) who starred in the 1978 film ''[[American Hot Wax]]''. McIntire and Nolan both appeared in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. He played a sheriff, while she voiced some of the "mother" lines.

McIntire and Nolan worked together as voice actors. In a 1969 [[KCET]] television reading of [[Norman Corwin]]'s 1938 radio play ''[[The Plot to Overthrow Christmas]]'', McIntire played [[Devil|the Devil]] and Nolan played [[Lucrezia Borgia]]. In 1977 they appeared in the Disney animated film ''[[The Rescuers]]'', in which he voiced the cat [[Rufus (The Rescuers)|Rufus]] and she the [[muskrat]] Ellie Mae. Four years later, the couple worked on another Disney film, ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'', with McIntire as the voice of Mr. Digger, a badger, and Nolan as the voice of Widow Tweed. {{cn|date=September 2013}}

==Death==
John McIntire died on January 30, 1991 from [[emphysema]] and [[lung cancer]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. Aside from Nolan, he was also survived by their daughter, Holly. McIntire and Nolan's son, actor/musician [[Tim McIntire]], predeceased his parents, dying in 1986 from heart problems.{{cn|date=September 2013}}
