'''Greta Garbo''' (born '''Greta Lovisa Gustafsson'''; {{IPA|/[[character|gre:ta lʊvi:sa]]/}}; 18 September 1905 – 15 April 1990) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] film actress and an international star and icon during Hollywood's silent and classic periods. Garbo was nominated three times for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and received an honorary one in 1954 for her "luminous and unforgettable screen performances." She also won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]] for both ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1935) and ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936). In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Garbo fifth on their list of [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|greatest female stars of all time]], after [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Audrey Hepburn]], and [[Ingrid Bergman]].

Garbo launched her career with a secondary role in the 1924 Swedish film ''[[The Saga of Gosta Berling]]''. Her performance caught the attention of [[Louis B. Mayer]], chief executive of [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]] ([[MGM]]), who brought her to [[Hollywood]] in 1925. She immediately stirred interest with her first silent film, ''[[Torrent (1926 film)|Torrent]]'', released in 1926; a year later, her performance in ''[[Flesh and the Devil]]'', her third movie, made her an international star.{{sfn|Vieira|2005|p=38}}

Garbo's first talking film was ''[[Anna Christie (1930 film)|Anna Christie]]'' (1930). MGM marketers enticed the public with the catch-phrase "Garbo talks!" That same year she starred  in ''[[Romance (1930 film)|Romance]]''. For her performances in these films she received the first of three [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Academy Award]] nominations for Best Actress. (Academy rules at the time allowed for a performer to receive a single nomination for their work in more than one film.<ref>http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1377809209073</ref>) In 1932, her popularity allowed her to dictate the terms of her contract and she became increasingly selective about her roles. Her success continued in films such as ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'' (1931) and ''[[Grand Hotel (film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932). Many critics and film historians consider her performance as the doomed courtesan [[The Lady of the Camellias|Marguerite Gautier]] in ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936) to be her finest. The role gained her a second Academy Award nomination. Garbo's career soon declined, however, and she was one of the many stars labeled "[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|Box Office Poison]]" in 1938. Her career revived upon her turn to comedy in ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939), which earned her a third Academy Award nomination, but after the failure of ''[[Two-Faced Woman]]'' (1941), she retired from the screen, at the age of 35, after acting in twenty-eight films.

Although she was offered many opportunities to return to the screen, she declined all of them. Instead, she lived a private life, shunning publicity. Garbo never married, had no children and lived alone as an adult. She was something of an art collector and her art collection was worth millions at the time of her death.

==Childhood and youth==
[[File:Greta Garbo, Södermalm.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Monument on the building which now stands where Greta Garbo was born on [[Södermalm]].]]
Greta Lovisa Gustafsson was born in [[Södermalm]], [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. She was the third and youngest child of Anna Lovisa (née Karlsson, 1872–1944)—a homemaker who later worked at a jam factory—and Karl Alfred Gustafsson (1871–1920), a laborer.<ref name="WareBraukman2004p227-228" /><ref name="Sjolander1971p12-13" /> Garbo had an older brother, Sven Alfred (1898–1967), and an older sister, Alva Maria (1903–1926).<ref name="Furhammar1991p129" />

Her parents met in Stockholm where her father visited from [[Frinnaryd]]. He moved to Stockholm to become independent and worked in various odd jobs—street cleaner, grocer, factory worker and butcher's assistant.{{sfn|Souhami|1994|p=64}} He married Anna, who had recently relocated from [[Högsby]].<ref>[http://carina.stridlund.se/hellbomwebb/pcf361e2e.html "Karl Alfred Gustafsson"]. Retrieved 7 December 2010.</ref>{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955b|p=76}} The Gustafssons were impoverished and lived in a three-bedroom cold-water flat at Blekingegatan No. 32. They raised their three children in a working-class district regarded as the city's slum.<ref name="DAmico1962p901" /> Garbo would later recall:

{{quote|It was eternally gray—those long winter's nights. My father would be sitting in a corner, scribbling figures on a newspaper. On the other side of the room my mother is repairing ragged old clothes, sighing. We children would be talking in very low voices, or just sitting silently. We were filled with anxiety, as if there were danger in the air. Such evenings are unforgettable for a sensitive girl. Where we lived, all the houses and apartments looked alike, their ugliness matched by everything surrounding us.<ref name="Lektyr1931" />}}

In the winter of 1919, the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]] spread throughout Stockholm, and Garbo's father, to whom she was very close, became ill.

==Career==

===Beginnings (1920–1924)===
Garbo first worked as a soap-lather girl in a barbershop but eventually, on the advice of her friends, applied for, and accepted, a position in the [[PUB (Stockholm)|PUB department store]] running errands and working in the millinery department. Before long, she began modeling hats for the store's catalogs which led to a more lucrative job as a fashion model.{{sfn|Swensen|1997|p=36}} In late 1920, a director of film commercials for the store began casting Garbo in roles advertising women's clothing. Her first commercial premiered on 12 December 1920 and was followed by others the following year.<ref name=Herr>[http://www.sfi.se/en-GB/Swedish-film-database/Item/?type=MOVIE&itemid=18583 "Herrskapet Stockholm ute på inköp (1920)"] The Swedish Film Database, Swedish Film Institute. Retrieved 3 April 2012. {{sv}}</ref> Thus began Garbo's cinematic career. In 1922, Garbo caught the attention of director Erik Arthur Petschler who gave her a part in his short comedy, ''Peter the Tramp''.{{sfn|Paris|1994|p=34}}

[[File:Greta Garbo in Gösta Berlings Saga 1924 cropped.jpg|left|thumb|Garbo in her first leading role in the Swedish film ''[[The Saga of Gosta Berling|The Saga of Gösta Berling]]'' (1924) with [[Lars Hanson]]]]
From 1922 to 1924, she studied at [[Dramatens elevskola|The Royal Dramatic Theatre's Acting School]] in Stockholm. She was recruited in 1924 by the prominent Swedish director [[Mauritz Stiller]] to play a principal part in his classic film ''The Saga of Gösta Berling'', a dramatization of the [[Gösta Berlings Saga|famous novel]] by [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Selma Lagerlöf]]. She played opposite [[Lars Hanson]], a well-known Swedish actor. Stiller became her mentor, training her as a film actress and managing all aspects of her nascent career.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=54–61}} She followed her role in ''Gösta Berling'' with a starring role in the 1925 German film ''[[Die freudlose Gasse]]'' (''Joyless Street'' or ''The Street of Sorrow''), directed by [[G. W. Pabst]] and co-starring [[Asta Nielsen]].{{sfn|Paris|1994|pp=67–69}}

Accounts differ on the circumstances of her first contract with [[Louis B. Mayer]], at that time vice president and general manager of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].
[[Victor Seastrom]], a respected Swedish director at MGM, was a good friend of Stiller and encouraged Mayer to meet him on a trip to Berlin. There are two recent versions of what happened next. In one,{{sfn|Swenson|1997|pp=72–74}} Mayer, always looking for new talent, had done his research and was interested in Stiller. He made an offer but Stiller demanded that Garbo be part of any contract, convinced that she would be an asset to his career. Mayer balked, but eventually agreed to a private viewing of ''Gösta Berling''. He was immediately struck by Garbo's magnetism and became more interested in her than in Stiller. "It was her eyes," his daughter recalled him saying; "I can make a star out of her." In the second version,{{sfn|Paris|1994|pp=80–83}} Mayer had already seen ''Gösta Berling'' before his Berlin trip and Garbo, not Stiller, was his primary interest. On the way to the screening, Mayer said to his daughter, "This director is wonderful but what we really ought to look at is the girl.... The girl, look at the girl!" After the screening, his daughter reported, he was unwavering: "I'll take her without him. I'll take her ''with'' him. Number one is the girl."{{sfn|Vieira|2005|p=9}}

===Silent film stardom (1925–1929)===
In 1925, Garbo, then twenty and unable to speak English, was brought over from Sweden at the request of Mayer. Both Garbo and Stiller arrived in New York in July 1925 after a ten-day trip on the [[SS Drottningholm|SS ''Drottningholm'']].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thomassjoberg.com/wp-content/uploads/Greta-Garbo.pdf | title=Greta Garbo's War on Hollywood | first=Scott | last=Reisfeld | date=September 2007 | work=Scanorama | accessdate=8 February 2015 }}</ref> However, they remained in New York for over six months without any word from MGM. They chose to go Los Angeles on their own, but another five weeks passed with no contacts from the studio.{{sfn|Paris|1994|p=84}}{{sfn|Swenson|1997|p=85}} Now on the verge of returning to Sweden, she wrote to her boyfriend back home: "You're quite right when you think I don't feel at home here. . . Oh you lovely little Sweden, I promise that when I return to you my sad face will smile as never before."<ref name=Sands>Sands, Frederick. ''The Divine Garbo'', Grosset & Dunlap (1979) pp. 69–73</ref>

A Swedish friend in Los Angeles decided to help her by contacting MGM producer [[Irving Thalberg]], who agreed to give her a screen test. According to author Frederick Sands, "the result of the test was electrifying. Thalberg was impressed and began grooming the young actress the following day, arranging to fix her teeth, making sure she lost weight, and giving her English lessons."<ref name=Sands/>

During her rise to stardom, film historian [[Mark Vieira]] notes that "Thalberg decreed that henceforth Garbo would play a young but worldly-wise woman . . . "<ref name=Vieira-1>Vieira, Mark A. ''Irving Thalberg: Boy Wonder to Producer Prince'', Univ. of California Press pp. 70-71(2010)</ref> However, according to Thalberg's actress wife, [[Norma Shearer]], Garbo did not necessarily agree with his ideas:
{{quote|Miss Garbo at first didn't like playing the exotic, the sophisticated, the woman of the world. She used to complain: "Mr. Thalberg, I am just a young gur-rl!" Irving tossed it off with a laugh. With those elegant pictures he was creating the Garbo image.<ref name=Vieira-1/>}}

Although she expected to work with Stiller on her first film,<ref name="Wollstein1994" /> she was cast in ''[[Torrent (1926 film)|Torrent]]'' (1926), an adaptation of a novel by [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]], with director [[Monta Bell]]. She replaced [[Aileen Pringle]], ten years her senior, and played a vamp opposite [[Ricardo Cortez]].<ref name="Katchmer1991" /><ref name="WalkerMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer1980" /> ''Torrent'' was a hit and despite its cool reception by the trade press,<ref name="Jacobs2008" /> Garbo's performance was critically acclaimed.<ref name="Variety-Torrent" /><ref name="HallHadaunt1926" /> [[File:Flesh and the Devil with John Gilbert.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Garbo in ''[[Flesh and the Devil]]'' (1926) with [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]]]

The success led [[Irving Thalberg]], head of production at MGM,<ref name="Billquist1960" /> to cast her in a similar role in ''[[The Temptress]]'' (1926), based on another Ibáñez novel. Stiller persuaded her to take the part and he was assigned to direct,<ref name="Thomsen1997p129" /> with Garbo now given top billing, playing opposite [[Antonio Moreno]].<ref name="Resto2008" /> Garbo, however, said she did not want to play another vamp and did not like the script any more than she did the first one.<ref name="Flamini1994" /> Stiller was also uncomfortable, having a hard time directing. ''The Temptress'' was becoming a harrowing experience, since he spoke little English and couldn't adapt to the studio system,<ref name="Biery1928c-Stiller-artist" /> which resulted him not getting along well with Moreno.<ref name="Golden2001" />

Thalberg therefore decided to have him replaced by [[Fred Niblo]]. Reshooting ''The Temptress'' was expensive and even though it became one of the top-grossing films of the 1926–27 season,<ref name="Vieira2009p67" /> it was the only Garbo film of the period to lose money.<ref name="Koszarski1994" /> However, Garbo received rave reviews<ref name="Brown1965" /><ref name="ConwayMcGregorRicci1968p51" /><ref name="Zierold1969p164" /><ref name="HallMorduant1926" /> and MGM had a new star.<ref name="Vieira2009p67" />{{sfn|Paris|1994|p=108}}

[[File:Garbo - Gilbert - publicity.jpg|thumb|left|Garbo with [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] in ''[[A Woman of Affairs]]'' (1928).]]
After her lightning ascent, Garbo went on to make eight more silent films and all were hits.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=568–570}} She starred in three of them with popular leading man [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]].{{sfn|Paris|1994|pp=124–125}} About their first movie, ''[[Flesh and the Devil]]'' (1926), silent film expert Kevin Brownlow states that "she gave a more erotic performance than Hollywood had ever seen."<ref name=TCMBrownlow>{{Cite video|title=Garbo|year=2005|last=Brownlow|first=Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Brownlow|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|medium=Television production|minutes=13:00-14:00}}</ref> Their on-screen chemistry soon translated into an off-camera romance and by the end of the production, they began living together.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=121}} The film also marked a turning point in Garbo's career. Vieira writes, "Audiences were mesmerized by her beauty and titillated by her love scenes with Gilbert. She was a sensation."{{sfn|Vieira|2009|p.=69}} Profits from her third movie with Gilbert, ''[[A Woman of Affairs]]'' (1928), catapulted her to top Metro star of the 1928&ndash;29 box office season.{{sfn|Swenson|1997|p=193}} In 1929, reviewer Pierre de Rohan wrote in the ''New York Telegraph'': "She has a glamour and fascination for both sexes which have never been equaled on the screen."{{sfn|Swenson|1997|p=220}}

The impact of Garbo's acting and screen presence quickly established her reputation as one of Hollywood's greatest actresses. Film historian and critic David Denby argues that Garbo introduced a subtlety of expression to the art of silent acting and that its effect on audiences cannot be exaggerated. She "lowers her head to look calculating or flutters her lips," he says. "Her face darkens with a slight tightening around the eyes and mouth; she registers a passing idea with a contraction of her brows or a drooping of her lids. Worlds turned on her movements."<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Artists|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2012/02/27/120227crat_atlarge_denby|date=27 February 2012|first=David|last=Denby|authorlink=David Denby (film critic)|work=[[The New Yorker]]|pages=74–78|accessdate=20 October 2012|issn=0028-792X}}</ref>

During this period, Garbo began to require unusual conditions during the shooting of her scenes. She prohibited visitors—including the studio brass—from her sets and demanded that black flats or screens surround her to prevent extras and technicians from watching her. When asked about these eccentric requirements, she said, "If I am by myself, my face will do things I cannot do with it otherwise."{{sfn|Paris|1994|pp=301–320}}

Despite her popularity as a silent star,{{Sfn|Crafton|1999|pp=495–496|ps=, "In December 1929, according to the volume of ''[[Photoplay]]'' fan mail&nbsp;... Garbo remained the leading female star."}} the studio feared that her Swedish accent might impair her work in sound and delayed the shift for as long as possible.{{Sfn|Crafton|1999|p=295}}<ref name="Limbacher1968p219" /> MGM itself made a slow changeover to sound{{Sfn|Crafton|1999|pp=206–207}} and her last silent movie, ''[[The Kiss (1929 film)|The Kiss]]'' (1929), was also the studio's.{{sfn|Vieira|2005|p=100}} Garbo would go on to become one of the biggest box office draws of the next decade.

===Continued success (1930–1939)===
[[File:First Talkie.jpg|thumb|190px|"Garbo talks!" in ''[[Anna Christie (1930 film)|Anna Christie]]'' (1930).]]

In late 1929, MGM cast Garbo in ''[[Anna Christie (1930 film)|Anna Christie]]'' (1930), a film adaptation of the [[Anna Christie|1922 play]] by [[Eugene O'Neill]], provided her first speaking role. The screenplay was adapted by [[Frances Marion]] and the film was produced by [[Irving Thalberg]] and [[Paul Bern]]. Sixteen minutes into the film, she famously utters her first line, "Gimme a whiskey, ginger ale on the side, and don't be stingy, baby." The film premiered in [[New York City]] on 21 February 1930 publicized with the catchphrase "Garbo talks!", and was the highest-grossing film of the year.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=111}} Garbo received her first [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] nomination for her performance, although she lost to MGM colleague [[Norma Shearer]]. Her nomination that year included her performance in ''[[Romance (1930 film)|Romance]]'' (1930). After filming ended, Garbo—along with a different director and cast—filmed a [[German language|German]]-language version of ''[[Anna Christie (1931 film)|Anna Christie]]'' that was released in December 1930.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=570}} The film's success certified Garbo's successful transition to [[Sound film|talkies]]. In her follow-up film, ''[[Romance (1930 film)|Romance]]'' (1930), she portrayed an [[Italy|Italian]] [[opera]] star opposite [[Lewis Stone]]. She was paired opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] in ''[[Inspiration (1931 film)|Inspiration]]'' (1931), and her popularity was used to boost the career of the relatively unknown [[Clark Gable]] in ''[[Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise)]]'' (1931). Although the films did not match Garbo's success with her sound debut, she was ranked as the most-popular female star in the United States in 1930 and 1931.

Garbo followed with two of her most famous roles. In 1931, she played the [[Mata Hari|World War I German spy]] in the lavish production of ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'', opposite [[Ramón Novarro]]. When the film was released, it "caused panic with police reserves required to keep the waiting mob in order." {{Sfn|qtd in Swenson|1997|p=266}} The following year, she played a [[Russia]]n ballerina in ''[[Grand Hotel (film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), opposite an ensemble cast, including [[John Barrymore]], [[Joan Crawford]], and [[Wallace Beery]] among others. The film won that year's [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. Both films had been MGM's highest-earning films of 1931 and 1932, respectively, and Garbo was dubbed "the greatest money-making machine ever put on screen."{{sfn|NYTimes|1990}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=244}}{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=284}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}
Garbo's close friend [[Mercedes de Acosta]] then penned a screenplay for her to portray [[Joan of Arc]]{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=269-270}} but producers rebuffed the idea and the film was shelved. After appearing in ''[[As You Desire Me (film)|As You Desire Me]]'' (1932), co-starring [[Melvyn Douglas]], Garbo's MGM contract expired.

After nearly a year of negotiations, Garbo agreed to renew her MGM contract on the condition she would star in ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'' on her new salary of $300,000 a film. The film's screenplay had been written by Viertel, and although MGM had been reluctant to make the movie, they relented at Garbo's insistence. For her leading man, producers suggested [[Charles Boyer]] or [[Laurence Olivier]], but Garbo rejected both, preferring her former co-star and lover, [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]. The studio balked at the idea of casting Gilbert, fearing his declining popularity would hurt the film's profits, but Garbo prevailed.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=183}} {{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=181}} 
''Queen Christina'' was a lavish production, becoming one of the studio's biggest productions at the time. Publicized as "Garbo returns," the film premiered in December 1933 to critical acclaim and box office triumph and became the highest-grossing film of the year. The movie, however, met with controversy upon its release; censors objected to the scenes in which Garbo disguised herself as a man and kissed a female co-star.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=572–573}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=316}}

Although her domestic box office popularity was undiminished in the early 1930s, high profits for Garbo's films after ''Queen Christina'' in 1933, depended on the foreign market for their success. ''[[The Painted Veil (1934 film)|The Painted Veil]]'', written by Viertel and [[John Meehan (screenwriter)|John Meehan]], was her next film. Accepting the part because the script had been tailored to fit her talent by Viertel, filming commenced on location in [[China]]. Garbo, although fond of the on-location shoot, was not particularly fond of her co-stars, [[Herbert Marshall]] and [[George Brent]].{{citation needed|date = May 2015}} When the film was released in 1934, it received mixed reviews from critics and was not the financial success MGM had hoped for. 
{{multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Greta Garbo - Karenina.jpg|caption1=Garbo and [[Fredric March]] in ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1935).|width1 = 200|image2=Garbo & Taylor - Camille 1936.jpg|caption2=Garbo and [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] in ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936).|width2=200}}
In the midst of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], American screen audiences seemed to favor "home-blown" screen couples, such as [[Clark Gable]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. Garbo's cosmopolitan look was beginning to generate more profits abroad; also, the type of historical and melodramatic films she began to make on the advice of Viertel, were highly successful abroad, but considerably lesser so in the United States. In  1935, [[David O. Selznick]] wanted to cast her as the dying heiress in ''[[Dark Victory]]'', but Garbo chose [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[Anna Karenina (1935 film)|Anna Karenina]]'' (1935) in which she played another of her renowned roles.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|pp=207-210}} Her critically acclaimed performance won her the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]]. The film was internationally successful and did better than MGM expected domestically.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=571, 172}} Still, its profit was significantly diminished because of her exorbitant salary.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=216}}

Garbo selected [[George Cukor]]'s romantic drama ''[[Camille (1936 film)|Camille]]'' (1936) as her next project. Thalberg cast her opposite talents [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] and former co-star, [[Lionel Barrymore]]. Cukor carefully crafted Garbo's portrayal of Marguerite Gatier, a lower-class woman, who becomes the world-renowned mistress Camille. Production was marred, however, by the sudden death of Thalberg, then only thirty-seven, which plunged the  Hollywood studios into a "state of profound shock," writes [[David Bret]].<ref name=Bret/>{{rp|272}} Garbo had grown close to Thalberg and his wife, [[Norma Shearer]], and had often dropped by their house unannounced. Her grief for Thalberg, some believe, was more profound than for [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], who died earlier that same year.<ref name=Bret>Bret, David. ''Greta Garbo: Divine Star'', Robson Press (2012)</ref>{{rp|272}} His death also added to the sombre mood required for the closing scenes of ''Camille''. When the film premiered in New York on 12 December 1936, it became an international success, Garbo's first major success in three years. She won a [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]] award for her performance, and she was again nominated for an Academy Award.

Garbo's follow-up project was [[Clarence Brown]]'s lavish production of ''[[Conquest (1937 film)|Conquest]]'' (1937) opposite [[Charles Boyer]]. The plotted the dramatized romance between [[Napoleon]] and [[Marie Walewska]]. It was MGM's biggest and most-publicized movie of 1937, but upon its release, it lost more than $1 million at the box office, becoming one of the studio's biggest failures of the decade.{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=316}} Garbo's popularity had considerably dropped, and when her contract expired soon thereafter, she returned briefly to Sweden. On 3 May 1938, Garbo was among the many stars—including [[Joan Crawford]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Luise Rainer]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Mae West]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Dolores del Río]] and others—dubbed to be "[[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|Box Office Poison]]" in an article published by Harry Brandt on behalf of the Independent Theatre Owners of America. 
[[File:Douglas-Ninotchka.jpg|right||thumb|190px|Garbo and co-star [[Melvyn Douglas]] share a passionate moment in ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939).]]
In the late 1930s, MGM decided a change-of-pace needed to occur in Garbo's career to resurrect her declining popularity. The studio teamed her with producer-director [[Ernst Lubitsch]] to film ''[[Ninotchka]]'', her first comedy. The film was one of the first Hollywood movies which, under the cover of a satirical, light romance, depicted the [[Soviet Union]] under Joseph Stalin as being rigid and gray when compared to its prewar years. ''Ninotchka'' premiered in October 1939, publicized with the catchphrase "Garbo laughs!", commenting on the departure of Garbo's serious and melancholy image as she transferred to comedy. Despite the film's critical favoritism and box office success in the United States and abroad, it was banned in the Soviet Union and its satellites.

===Last work and early retirement (1941–1948)===
With [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Two-Faced Woman]]'' (1941), MGM attempted to capitalize on Garbo's success in ''Ninotchka'' by casting her in a romantic comedy which sought to portray her as an ordinary girl. She played a double role that featured her dancing the rumba, swimming, and skiing. The film was a critical failure, but, contrary to popular belief, performed reasonably well at the box office.{{sfn|Paris|1994|p=573}} Garbo referred to the film as "my grave."{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955c|p=129}} ''Two-Faced Woman'' was her last film; she was thirty-six and had made twenty-eight feature films in sixteen years.

[[File:ActGarboNinotchka.jpg|thumb|left|With [[Melvyn Douglas]] in ''[[Ninotchka]]'' (1939).]]
Although Garbo was humiliated by the negative reviews of ''Two-Faced Woman'', she did not at first intend to retire.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=381}}{{Sfn|Vieira|1994|p=267}} But her films depended on the European market and when it fell through with the war, finding a vehicle was problematic for MGM.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=268}}{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=281}} She signed a one-picture deal in 1942 to make ''The Girl from Leningrad'' but the project quickly dissolved.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=268}} She still thought she would continue when the war was over{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=268}}{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=383}} though she was ambivalent and indecisive about returning to the screen. [[Salka Viertel]], Garbo's close friend and collaborator, said in 1945, "Greta is impatient to work. But on the other side, she's afraid of it."{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=270}} Garbo also worried about her age. "Time leaves traces on our small faces and bodies. It's not the same anymore, being able to pull it off."{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=270}} George Cukor, director of ''Two-Faced Woman'', and often blamed for its failure, said, "People often glibly say that the failure of ''Two-Faced Woman'' finished Garbo's career. That's a grotesque oversimplification. It certainly threw her, but I think that what really happened was that she just gave up. She didn’t want to go on."{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=383}}

Still, Garbo signed a contract in 1948 with producer [[Walter Wanger]], who had produced ''Queen Christina'', to shoot a picture based on [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]]'s ''La Duchesse de Langeais''. [[Max Ophüls]] was slated to adapt and direct.<ref name="Reid2006p44" /><ref name="Kellow2004p338" /><ref name="ForrestKoos2002p151-152" /> She made several [[screen test]]s, learned the script, and arrived in Rome in the summer of 1949 to shoot the picture. However, the financing failed to materialize and the project was abandoned.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955c|p=130}} The screen tests—the last time Garbo stepped in front of a movie camera—were thought to have been lost for forty-one years until they were rediscovered in 1990 by film historians [[Leonard Maltin]] and [[Jeanine Basinger]].{{sfn|Paris|1994|p=426}} Parts of the footage were included in the 2005 [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] documentary ''Garbo''.<ref name="TCM-GarboDoc" />

In 1949, she was offered the role of fictional silent film star Norma Desmond in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''. However, after a meeting with film producer [[Charles Brackett]], she insisted that she had no interest in the part whatsoever.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

She was offered many roles in the 1940s and throughout her retirement years but she rejected all but a few of them. In the few instances when she accepted, the slightest problem led her to drop out.{{Sfn|Vieira|2005|p=271}} Although she refused to talk to friends throughout her life about her reasons for retiring, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman four years before her death, "I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. There were many days when I had to force myself to go to the studio... I really wanted to live another life."{{Sfn|Broman|1990|p=271}}

===Public persona===
From the early days of her career, Garbo avoided industry social functions, preferring to spend her time alone or with friends. She never signed autographs or answered fan mail, and rarely gave interviews.{{sfn|Bainbridge|1955a|p=12}}<ref name="NYT-GarboBack-smokinglounge" /> Nor did she ever appear at Oscar ceremonies even when she was nominated.{{Sfn|Krutzen|1992|p=46}} Her aversion to publicity and the press was undeniably genuine,{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=129, 156-157, 243}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=196}} and exasperating to the studio at first. In an interview in 1928, she explained that her desire for privacy began when she was child, stating, "as early as I can remember, I have wanted to be alone. I detest crowds, don't like many people."<ref>Biery, April 1928</ref> But MGM eventually capitalized on it for it bolstered the image of the silent and reclusive woman of mystery.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=179}}{{Sfn|Krutzen|1992|p=46}}{{Sfn|Swensen|1997|p=196-197}}{{refn|Because Garbo was suspicious and mistrustful of the media, and often at odds with MGM executives, she spurned Hollywood's publicity rules. Except at the start of her career, Garbo conducted few interviews (she gave only fourteen in her life),{{sfn|Paris|1994|p=178}} signed no autographs, attended few industry social functions, and turned down all but a few requests for public appearances. She was routinely referred to by the press as the "Swedish Sphinx." Her reticence and fear of strangers perpetuated the mystery and mystique that she projected both on screen and in real life. In spite of her strenuous efforts to avoid publicity, Garbo paradoxically became one of the twentieth century's most publicized women in the world.{{sfn|NYTimes|1990}}{{sfn|Barnes|1990}}|group=note}}

She is closely associated with a line from ''Grand Hotel'', one which the [[American Film Institute]] in 2005 voted the 30th [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|most memorable movie quote of all time]],<ref>{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|url=http://www.afi.com/100years/quotes.aspx|accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref> "I want to be alone; I just want to be alone." The theme became a running gag beginning in her silent pictures.<ref name="NYT-Obit-let-alone">{{Harvnb|NYTimes|1990}}. A declaration often attributed to her was, "I want to be alone."

By next spring I shall probably be... quite alone."

==Personal life==

===Retirement===
In retirement, Garbo generally led a private life of simplicity and leisure. She made no public appearances and assiduously tried to avoid the publicity she loathed.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=5, 57, 156–158 passim}} As she had been during her Hollywood years, Garbo, with her innate need for solitude, was often reclusive. But contrary to myth, she had, from the beginning, many friends and acquaintances with whom she socialized, and later, traveled.{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=244, 508–509 passim}}{{Sfn|Paris|1994}} Occasionally, she jet-setted with well-known and wealthy personalities, striving to guard her privacy as she had during her career. [[File:Greta Garbo in 1950.jpg|thumb|Garbo signing her US citizenship papers in 1950]]
Still, she often floundered about what to do and how to spend her time ("drifting" was the word she frequently used),{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=417, 445}} always struggling with her many eccentricities,{{Sfn|Paris|1994}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|}} and her lifelong melancholy, or depression, and moodiness.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=8-9, 107-108, 167, 329-30, 506-11 passim}}{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|pp=87, 91, 115, 143 passim}} As she approached her sixtieth birthday, she told a frequent walking companion, "In a few days, it will be the anniversary of the sorrow that never leaves me, that will never leave me for the rest of my life."{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=526}} To another friend she said in 1971, "I suppose I suffer from very deep depression."{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=506}} It is also arguable, says one biographer, that she was bipolar. "I am very happy one moment, the next there is nothing left for me," she said in 1933.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=506}}

Beginning in the 1940s, she became something of an art collector. Many of the paintings she purchased were of negligible value, but she did buy paintings by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]],{{sfn|Swenson|1997|pp=426–427, 530}} and [[Alexej von Jawlensky|Jawlensky]].{{sfn|Broman|1990|p=227}} Her art collection was worth millions when she died in 1990.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=344}}

Italian motion picture director [[Luchino Visconti]] allegedly attempted to bring Garbo back to the screen in 1969 with a small part, [[Maria Sophie of Bavaria|Maria Sophia, Queen of Naples]], in his adaptation of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time|Remembrance of Things Past]]''. He exclaimed: "I am very pleased at the idea that this woman, with her severe and authoritarian presence, should figure in the decadent and rarefied climate of the world described by Proust."{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=460}} Claims that Garbo was interested in the part cannot be substantiated.{{Sfn|Swenson|1997|p=541}}{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=460}}

In 1971, Garbo vacationed with her close friend Baroness Cécile [[de Rothschild]] at her summer home in Southern France.{{Sfn|Vickers|2002}} De Rothschild introduced her to [[Samuel Adams Green]], a well-known art collector and curator in New York, and the two formed an immediate bond.<ref name=TelgObit>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/8391579/Sam-Green.html|title=Sam Green - Obituary|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 March 2011|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref>  Green, who became an important friend and walking companion, was in the habit of tape-recording all of his telephone calls and, with Garbo's permission, recorded many of his conversations with her. In 1985, Garbo ended the friendship when she was falsely informed that Green had played the tapes to friends.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|p=526}} In his last will and testament, Green bequeathed in 2011 all of the tapes, which reveal Garbo's personality in later life, sense of humor, and various eccentricities, to the film archives at [[Wesleyan University]].<ref name=WaStars>{{cite web|url=http://warholstars.org/sam_green_obituary.html|title=Sam Green - Obituary|publisher=warholstars.org|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref>

Although she became increasingly withdrawn in her final years,{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=506–511}} she had become close over time to her cook and house-keeper, Claire Koger, who worked for her for thirty-one years. "We were very close—like sisters," the reticent Koger said.{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=537–538}}

Throughout her life, Garbo was known for taking long, daily walks with companions or by herself. In retirement, she walked the streets of New York City dressed casually and wearing large sunglasses. "Garbo-watching" became a sport for photographers, the media, admirers, and curious New Yorkers,{{Sfn|Paris|1994|pp=495–505}} but she maintained her elusive mystique to the end.

===Relationships===
Garbo never married, had no children, and lived alone as an adult. Her most famous romance was with her frequent co-star, [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]], with whom she lived intermittently in 1926 and 1927.{{sfn|Swenson|1997|pp=122–127, 129–135}} Soon after their romance began, Gilbert began helping her acting on the set, teaching her how to behave like a star, how to socialize at parties, and how to deal with studio bosses.<ref name=Gross>Gross, Michael.

"But I froze. I was afraid he would tell me what to do and boss me. I always wanted to be the boss."<ref name=Gross/>

In 1937, she met conductor [[Leopold Stokowski]] with whom she had a highly publicized friendship or romance while traveling throughout Europe the following year.{{sfn|Swenson|1997|pp=368–382}}{{sfn|Paris|1994|pp=349–351, 353–355}} In his diary, [[Erich Maria Remarque]] discusses a liaison with Garbo in 1941{{sfn|Swenson|1997|pp=414-415}} and in his memoir, [[Cecil Beaton]] described an affair with her in 1947 and 1948.{{sfn|Swenson|1997|pp=457–460}}{{sfn|Paris|1994|pp=404-409}} In 1941 she met the Russian-born millionaire, George Schlee, who was introduced to her by his wife, fashion designer [[Valentina (fashion designer)|Valentina]]. Nicholas Turner, Garbo's close friend for 33 years, said that after Garbo bought an apartment in the same building, "Garbo moved in and took Schlee right away from Valentina."<ref name=Gross/> Schlee would split his time between the two, becoming Garbo's close companion and advisor until his death in 1964.{{sfn|Swenson|1997|pp=428–504}}{{sfn|Paris|1994|pp=412–552}}

==Legacy==
[[File:Garbo in Inspiration.jpg|right|thumb|Garbo in ''[[Inspiration (1931 film)|Inspiration]]'' (1931) publicity still]]
Garbo was an international superstar during the late silent era and the "[[Golden Age of Hollywood|Golden Age]]" of Hollywood and is widely regarded as a cinematic legend.{{sfn|Paris|1994|p=4}} Almost immediately, with the sudden popularity of her first pictures, she became a screen icon.{{sfn|Vieira|2005|p=6}} For most of her career, she was the highest paid actor or actress at MGM, making her for many years its "premier prestige star."{{sfn|Vieira|2005|p=7}}{{sfn|Swenson|1997|p=406}} It has been said that at the peak of her popularity she had become a virtual cult figure.{{sfn|Barnes|1990}}

Garbo developed an acting style that is thought to have been ahead of its time, one that set her apart from other actors and actresses of the period.<ref name="vance">Vance, Jeffrey (2005). ''The Mysterious Lady'', The Garbo Silents Collection: Audio commentary, DVD; Disk 1/3. (TCM Archives).</ref> About her work in silents, film critic Ty Burr said, "This was a new kind of actor—not the stage actor who had to play to the far seats but someone who could just look and with her eyes literally go from rage to sorrow in just a close-up."<ref name=AMCBurr>{{Cite video|title=Greta Garbo: A Lone Star|year=2001|author=Cole, Steve (director)|publisher=[[American Movie Classics]]|medium=Television production|minutes=10:57-11:07.}}</ref> Film historian [[Jeffrey Vance]] said that Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters and the truth of the situation. This approach demonstrated a deep bond with the character, with actions seemingly made on the basis of internal motivation—now referred to as working "from the inside-out"—and accounts for the restrained realism of her performances.<ref name="vance"/> "She doesn't act," said ''Camille'' co-star Rex O’Malley; "she lives her roles."{{sfn|Swenson|1997|p=357}} Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer, "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up.

Many critics have said that few of Garbo's twenty-four Hollywood films are artistically exceptional, and that many are simply bad.{{sfn|Vieira|2005|pp=6–8}} It has been said, however, that her commanding and magnetic performances usually overcome the weaknesses of plot and dialogue.{{sfn|Vieira|2005|pp=6–8}}{{sfn|Barnes|1990}} As one biographer put it, "All moviegoers demanded of a Garbo production was Greta Garbo."{{sfn|Swenson|1997|p=282}}

[[File:Greta Garbo - 1936.jpg|thumb|In ''Camille'' (1936)]]
She was portrayed by [[Betty Comden]] in the 1984 film ''[[Garbo Talks]]''. The film concerns a dying Garbo fan ([[Anne Bancroft]]) whose last wish is to meet her idol. Her son (played by [[Ron Silver]]) sets about trying to get Garbo to visit his mother at the hospital.

Garbo is the subject of several documentaries, including four made in the United States between 1990 and 2005:

She has been praised in the media and by personalities in cinema and culture, including:

[[Ephraim Katz]] (''The Film Encyclopedia: The Complete Guide to Film and the Film Industry''):<ref>{{Cite book|first=Ephraim |last=Katz|authorlink=Ephraim Katz|title=The Film Encyclopedia: The Complete Guide to Film and the Film Industry|year=1979 |edition=1st |publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Co |location=New York |page=465|isbn=978-0-690-01204-0}}</ref>

<blockquote>Of all the stars who have ever fired the imaginations of audiences, none has quite projected a magnetism and a mystique equal to Garbo's. "The Divine," the "dream princess of eternity," the "Sarah Bernhardt of films," are only a few of the superlatives writers used in describing her over the years.... She played heroines that were at once sensual and pure, superficial and profound, suffering and hopeful, world-weary and life-inspiring.</blockquote>

[[Bette Davis]]:<ref>{{Cite book|first=Bette|last=Davis |title=The Lonely Life |year=1990 |origyear=1962 |publisher= Berkley Books |location=New York |page=116 |isbn=978-0-425-12350-8}}</ref>

<blockquote>Her instinct, her mastery over the machine, was pure witchcraft. I cannot analyze this woman's acting. I only know that no one else so effectively worked in front of a camera.</blockquote>

[[George Cukor]]:<ref>{{Cite book  |first=Robert Emmet |last=Long |title=George Cukor: Interviews |year=2001 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |location=Jackson |series=Conversations with Filmmakers |page=47 |isbn=978-1-57806-387-1}}</ref>

<blockquote>She had a talent that few actresses or actors possess. In close-ups she gave the impression, the illusion of great movement. She would move her head just a little bit and the whole screen would come alive, like a strong breeze that made itself felt.</blockquote>

<ref name="Biery1928a-hatesc">
{{Harvnb|Biery|1928a|p=}}. I hated school. I hated the bonds they put on me. There were so many things outside. I liked history best but I was afraid of the map—geography you call it. But I had to go to go to school like other children. The public school, just as you have in this country.</ref>

<ref name="Biery1928a-noplay">{{Harvnb|Biery|1928a|p=}}. I didn't play much. Except skating and skiing and throwing snowballs. I did most of my playing by thinking. I played a little with my brother and sister, pretending we were in shows. Like other children. But usually I did my own pretending. I was up and down. Very happy one moment, the next moment – there was nothing left for me.</ref>

<ref name="Biery1928a-sixorseven">{{Harvnb|Biery|1928a|p=}}. Then I found a theater. I must have been six or seven. Two theaters, really. One was a cabaret; one a regular theater, – across from one another. And there was a back porch to both of them. A long plank on which the actors and actresses walked to get in the back door. I used to go there at seven o'clock in the evening, when they would be coming in, and wait until eight-thirty. Watch them come in; listen to them getting ready. The big back door was always open even in the coldest weather. Listen to their voices doing their parts in the productions. Smell the grease paint! There is no smell in the world like the smell of the backyard of a theater. No smell that will mean as much to me – ever. Night after night, I sat there dreaming. Dreaming when I would be inside – getting ready.</ref>

<ref name="Biery1928c-Stiller-artist">{{Harvnb|Biery|1928c|p=}}. Mr. Stiller is an artist. He does not understand about the American factories. He has always made his own pictures in Europe, where he is the master. In our country it is always the small studio. He does not understand the American Business. He could speak no English. So he was taken off the picture. It was given to Mr. Niblo. How I was broken to pieces, nobody knows. I was so unhappy I did not think I could go on.</ref>

They swish the air at least a half-inch beyond her languid orbs. Miss Garbo is not a conventional beauty, yet she makes all other beauties seem a little obvious.{{'-}}}}</ref>
