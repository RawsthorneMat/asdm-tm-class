==Biography==
Renny Harlin was born in [[Riihimäki]], [[Finland]], to a [[nurse]] and a [[physician]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/83/Renny-Harlin.html|title=Renny Harlin Biography (1959-)|publisher=Film Reference}}</ref>

Harlin started his career in the film business in the beginning of 1980s, directing commercials and company films for companies like Shell. Later, he worked as a buyer for a Finnish [[film distributor]] and met Finnish [[Markus Selin]] in Los Angeles in 1982. They became friends and started writing a [[screenplay]] called "Arctic Heat", which later evolved into ''[[Born American]]'', with Mike Norris in the leading role. They secured financing from the USA, and in 1986 ''Born American'' became the most expensive Finnish film ever opened in the USA in over 1,000 theaters and reached number 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001317/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|title=Renny Harlin Biography |publisher=IMDb}}</ref>

Harlin moved to Los Angeles and got a job from [[Irwin Yablans]], who offered him a script of ''[[Prison (1988 film)|Prison]]'' to film. The film was made with a low budget and distributed with only 42 copies. In the same year, 1988, he got a job from New Line Cinema to direct ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]'' (1988) after meeting producer [[Robert Shaye]], who at the first didn't want Harlin to direct the film. It became the highest-grossing film in the series, its budget being seven times greater than the original ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001317/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|title=Renny Harlin Biography |publisher=IMDb}}</ref>

''[[The Adventures of Ford Fairlane]]'' and ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' were edited simultaneously and released a week apart in 1990. The former flopped, but the latter was a commercial success. Harlin achieved critical acclaim the following year when he produced ''[[Rambling Rose (film)|Rambling Rose]]'' through his own Midnight Sun Pictures for director [[Martha Coolidge]]. The film won Best Feature at the 1992 [[Independent Spirit Awards]] and earned its star and Harlin's then-partner [[Laura Dern]] a [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Oscar]] nomination at the [[64th Academy Awards|1992 Academy Awards]].

Harlin's next project after ''[[Driven]]'' was to be a movie adaptation of the [[Ray Bradbury]] short story ''[[A Sound of Thunder]]'', but Harlin left the project after a disagreement with Bradbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/harlin-fired-from-thunder_article_31514.html|title=Harlin Fired From THUNDER?|first=Frank|last=Kurtz}}</ref> Although the director was changed, Harlin was credited as a producer when the finished [[A Sound of Thunder (film)|film]] was released in 2005.

Harlin took over directing the action mystery film ''[[Mindhunters]]'' when the original director [[Peter Howitt]] dropped out, but the release was delayed by studio conflicts. Harlin went on to re-shoot a more traditional horror version of ''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]'' when the studio was unhappy with the psychological drama cut by director [[Paul Schrader]].<ref name="imdbMovieWeb">{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/98/2798.php|title=Nothing left of Paul Schrader's EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING|accessdate=22 July 2007|author=Variety|publisher=MovieWeb.com}}</ref> Due to the delays with ''Mindhunters'', both films ended up being released in 2004 and both were moderate successes.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 2006, Harlin collaborated with Markus Selin to direct a biopic of the Finnish President and Marshall of Finland [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]], but budget constraints put the project on hold.  Instead, Harlin made another foray into low-budget horror with ''[[The Covenant (film)|The Covenant]]'', which was another moderate commercial success. In 2007 the Mannerheim film project resumed temporarily and Harlin returned to Finland. Production began in 2008 with Mikko Nousiainen starring as Mannerheim. However, 30% of the funding was cut by one of the financiers due to the [[Late-2000s recession|global economic recession]], and the delay meant that the time window for shooting the winter scenes during the spring of 2009 passed. Pre-production finally commenced in 2010, and the project was assigned to [[Dome Karukoski]] in August 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Dome+Karukoski+will+produce+Mannerheim+film+with+a+smaller+budget+than+Renny+Harlin/1135269745581|title=Dome Karukoski will produce Mannerheim film with a smaller budget than Renny Harlin}}</ref>

In 2007, it was announced that Harlin would direct an adaption of the comic-book series ''[[Brodie's Law]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/renny-harlin-to-make-his-first-film-in-finland-in-20-years/4031113.article|title=Renny Harlin to make his first film in Finland in 20 years|publisher=Screen Daily|first=Jorn Rossing|last=Jensen|date=February 21, 2007}}</ref>

Harlin directed the [[WWE Studios]] action movie ''[[12 Rounds (film)|12 Rounds]]'', starring [[John Cena]]. It was released in March 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/28/movies/28roun.html|title=Movie Review - 12 Rounds (2009)|publisher=The New York Times|first=Nathan|last=Lee|date=March 27, 2009}}</ref>

In 2009, Harlin directed an independent war film in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The film, ''[[5 Days of War]]'', was a story about the [[2008 South Ossetia War|2008 war]] between Georgia and [[Russia]] in the region of [[South Ossetia]]. In the film, [[President of Georgia]] [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] was played by Cuban-American actor [[Andy García]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8316018.stm|title=Movie star plays Georgian leader|date=October 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref>

In April 2012, it was announced that Harlin would direct ''[[Devil's Pass]]'' set in Russia’s Ural Mountains. The fact-based film dealt with the [[Dyatlov Pass incident]] in 1959, when nine experienced hikers were found dead. The film was released in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=33751|title=Renny Harlin Heads For Dyatlov Pass|publisher=Empire|first=Owen|last=Williams|date=24 April 2012}}</ref>
