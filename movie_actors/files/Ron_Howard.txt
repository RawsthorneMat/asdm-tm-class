== Career ==
=== Early acting roles and ''The Andy Griffith Show'' ===
[[File:Andy Griffith Ron Howard Andy Griffith Show 1961.JPG|thumb|right|[[Andy Griffith]] and Howard in ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', circa 1961]]
In 1959, Howard had his first credited film role, in ''[[The Journey (1959 film)|The Journey]]''. He appeared in [[June Allyson]]'s [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] [[anthology series]] ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]'' in the episode "Child Lost"; in the ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Walking Distance]]"; a few episodes of the first season of the sitcom ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', as Stewart, one of Dennis's friends; and several first and second season episodes of ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''. Howard played "Timmy" (uncredited) in "Counterfeit Gun", Season 4, Episode 2 (1960) of the TV series, "[[The Cheyenne Show]]."

In 1960, Howard was cast as [[Opie Taylor]] in ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''. Credited as "Ronny Howard", he portrayed the son of the title character (played by [[Andy Griffith]]) for all eight seasons of the show. After cancellation, the two would continue to keep in touch (primarily by phone) and would join themselves in two separate TV reunions, for nearly 45 years until Griffith's death in July 2012. As the news of his TV father's death was being reported, Howard released a statement: <blockquote>"His love of creating, the joy he took in it whether it was drama or comedy or his music, was inspiring to grow up around. The spirit he created on the set of ''The Andy Griffith Show'' was joyful and professional all at once. It was an amazing environment. And I think it was a reflection of the way he felt about having the opportunity to create something that people could enjoy. It was always with respect and passion for the opportunity and really what it could offer people in a very unpretentious and earthy way. He felt he was always working in service of an audience he really respected and cared about. He was a great influence on me. His passing is sad. But he lived a great rich life."<ref>{{cite web |last=Finke |first=Nikki |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/07/ron-howard-andy-griffith-remembrance-andy-griffith-show/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Ron Howard On Andy Griffith |date=July 3, 2012 |publisher=deadline.com |accessdate=September 18, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

In the 1962 film version of ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]'', Howard played [[Winthrop Paroo]], the child with the lisp; the film starred [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] and [[Shirley Jones]]. He also starred in the 1963 film ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father (film)|The Courtship of Eddie's Father]],'' with [[Glenn Ford]].

Billed as "Ronny Howard", he appeared as Barry Stewart on ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'', in the episode "Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?" in 1965; on ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'', in the episode "Little Boy Lost", in 1966; as [[Henry Fonda]]'s son in an ABC series, ''[[The Smith Family (TV series)|The Smith Family]]'', in 1971–72; and as an underage [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] on ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', in the episode "[[Sometimes You Hear the Bullet]]", in 1973.

Howard appeared on the 1969 [[Disneyland Records]] album ''The Story and Song from the Haunted Mansion''. It featured the story of two teenagers, Mike (Howard) and Karen (Robie Lester), who get trapped inside the [[Haunted Mansion]]. [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] plays the Narrator, Pete Reneday plays the Ghost Host, and Eleanor Audley plays Madame Leota. Some of the effects and ideas that were planned but never permanently made it to the attraction are mentioned here: the Raven speaks in the Stretching Room, and the Hatbox Ghost is mentioned during the Attic scene. It was reissued in 1998 as a cassette tape titled ''A Spooky Night in Disney's Haunted Mansion'' and on CD in 2009.

In 1974 Howard guest starred as Seth Turner, the best friend of Jason Walton (Jon Walmsley), in ''[[The Waltons]]'', "The Gift". In the episode, Seth wants to learn to play an instrument in his father's band, but it looks as if he will not have the time; he has been diagnosed with leukemia. The concept of death — and the unfairness of it all — is an extremely difficult one for Jason to accept, and it is up to Grandpa to help the boy through this crisis. Featured in the cast as Dr. McIvers is Ron Howard's father Rance Howard.<ref>MSN Entertainment ''The Waltons: The Gift''</ref>

=== Film roles and ''Happy Days'' ===

Howard's last significant on-screen role was a reprisal of his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV movie ''[[Return to Mayberry]]'', an ''Andy Griffith Show'' reunion reuniting him with Griffith, [[Don Knotts]], and most of the cast. He also appeared in two ''Happy Days'' TV reunions: 1992's ''The Happy Days Reunion Special'', a retrospective hosted by Winkler that aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]; and 2005's ''The Happy Days 30th Anniversary Reunion'', where he was reunited with most of the surviving cast.
