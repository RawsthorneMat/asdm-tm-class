==Early life==
Sturridge was born in [[Lambeth]], [[London]], the son of director [[Charles Sturridge]] and actress [[Phoebe Nicholls]], and a grandson of actor [[Anthony Nicholls (actor)|Anthony Nicholls]] and actress Faith Kent (née Heaslip).<ref name=" British Film Institute">{{cite web | work=British Film Institute| title=Film and TV Database NICHOLLS, Phoebe| url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/58880 | accessdate=April 26, 2007}}</ref> His maternal great-grandfather was photographer [[Horace Nicholls]].

Sturridge was educated at [[the Harrodian School]] and at [[Winchester College]], but he left before sitting his A levels. The eldest of three children, he has two younger siblings, brother Arthur and sister Matilda, both of whom followed him into theatre arts. [[Matilda Sturridge]] is an actress, and Arthur was an original cast member of ''[[School of Comedy]],'' which has aired on E4 after finding success at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]].

==Career==
Sturridge began as a [[child actor]] and he was in the 1996 television adaptation of ''[[Gulliver's Travels (TV miniseries)|Gulliver's Travels]],'' directed by his father and co-starring his mother. He reemerged in 2004 with ''[[Vanity Fair (2004 film)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Being Julia]].'' In 2005 he played [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]] in BBC4's ''[[A Waste of Shame]]''.

In 2006, he played the role of Nigel in the psychological thriller ''[[Like Minds]],'' also known by the title of ''[[Murderous Intent]].'' It tells the story of two boys, Alex (played by [[Eddie Redmayne]]) and Nigel, placed together as room-mates, much to Alex's objections. Alex is horrified and yet fascinated with the ritual-influenced deaths that begin to occur around them, and when Nigel himself is murdered, Alex is blamed.

He was originally cast as the lead in the [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] [[trilogy]] ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]].'' However, two months into production, [[New Regency Productions|New Regency]] and [[20th Century Fox]], fearing the gamble of spending over $100 million on a film starring an unknown actor,<ref name="JoBlo.com">{{cite web | work=JoBlo.com | title=Hayden in on Jumper| url=http://www.joblo.com/index.php?id=12443 | accessdate=April 26, 2007 |first=Mike |last=Sampson |date=August 11, 2006}}</ref> replaced him with the "more prominent" [[Hayden Christensen]].<ref name="SciFi.com">{{cite web | work=SCI FI Wire | title=Christensen Teleports To Jumper| url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=37463 |date=August 11, 2006 |accessdate=April 26, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070325091322/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=37463 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = March 25, 2007}}</ref>

In 2009, he appeared as Carl, one of the lead roles in the [[Richard Curtis]] comedy, ''[[The Boat That Rocked]],'' (known as ''[[Pirate Radio (film)|Pirate Radio]].'' in the United States) alongside [[Bill Nighy]], [[Rhys Ifans]] and [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]. In September, 2009, he made his stage debut in ''Punk Rock,'' a then newly dramatised play by [[Simon Stephens]] at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]] Theatre,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tom-sturridge-joins-alec-baldwin-414969 |title=Tom Sturridge Joins Alec Baldwin and Shia LaBeouf in Broadway's 'Orphans' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Joshua |last=Stecker |date=January 23, 2013 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref> appearing as a character loosely modelled after the teenage killers at [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|Columbine High School]]. For that performance, he was nominated for Most Outstanding Newcomer in the 2009 [[Evening Standard Awards]], and won the 2009 [[Critics' Circle Theatre Award]] in that same category.

He appeared alongside [[Rachel Bilson]] in the 2011 indie-romance, ''[[Waiting for Forever]]''.  He also played a role loosely based on poet [[Allen Ginsburg]] in [[Walter Salles]]'s 2012 film adaptation of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]].'' In spring 2013, he starred in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[[Orphans (Lyle Kessler play)|Orphans]]'' as Phillip, who is developmentally disabled, for which he was nominated for the [[Tony Award]], Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Play for his performance.

==Personal life==
