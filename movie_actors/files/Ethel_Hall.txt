'''Ethel Hall''' (1898 - 1927) was an American [[silent film]] actress who died at the age of 29 on June 29, 1927 when her boat capsized in the rapids of the [[Merced River]] near the town of [[Merced, California|Merced]] in the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. At the time she was performing as a [[stunt double]] for actress [[Dorothy Dwan]] in the film ''Tumbling River''.<ref>[[New York Times]], ''Girl Killed In Film Stunt'', July 1, 1927, Page 8</ref>

Hall was accompanied in the boat by [[Wallace McDonald]], who played villains in motion pictures. The actors were supposed to be rescued by a group before they entered the foot of the rapids. When the boat suddenly overturned McDonald was able to swim ashore. However Hall's head struck a rock and she was taken out of the water unconscious and soon expired.<ref>Modesto News-Herald  Jul 2, 1927 page 4</ref>

She was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John McGee of [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and had just recently wed stage actor John Drayer, who was performing in Seattle at the time of her fatal accident. The film's male lead, [[Tom Mix]], was injured in a horseback accident just a few weeks earlier.<ref>[[New York Times]], ''Girl Killed In Film Stunt'', July 1, 1927, Page 8</ref><ref>Modesto News-Herald  Jul 1, 1927 page 20</ref>
