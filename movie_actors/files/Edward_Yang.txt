==Biography==

===Youth and early career===
Edward Yang was born in Shanghai in 1947, and grew up in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]]. After studying [[Electronic Engineering]] in [[National Chiao Tung University]], he enrolled in the graduate program at the [[Florida State University]], where he received his [[Masters Degree]] in [[Electrical and Computer Engineering]] in 1974.<ref name=ID>''International Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers''. Eds. Sara Pendergast and Tom Pendergast. Vol. 2: Directors. 4th ed. Detroit: St. James Press, 2001. p1092-1094. 4 vols. "Edward Yang" accessed through Thomson Gale's Biography Research Centre 1 July 2007</ref> During this time and briefly afterwards, Yang worked at the Center for Informatics Research.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Yang always had a great interest in film ever since he was a child, but put away his aspirations in order to pursue a career in the high-tech industry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Also, a brief enrollment at [[USC Film School]] after graduating with his M.S.E.E. convinced him that the world of film was not for him - he thought USC film school's teaching methodologies were too commercial-oriented.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Yang then applied and was accepted into [[Harvard]]'s architecture school, the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], but decided not to attend.<ref>Associated Press, Edward Yang, 59, Director who focused on Taiwan Life, http://www.mercurynews.com/localnewsheadlines/ci_6280205, July 2, 2007. {{Dead link|date=October 2009}}</ref> Thereafter, he went to [[Seattle]] to work in [[microcomputers]] and defense software.

While working in Seattle, Yang came across the [[Werner Herzog]] film ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972). This encounter rekindled Yang's passion for film and introduced him to a wide range of classics in world and European cinema. Yang was particularly inspired by the films of Italian director [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] (Antonioni's influence has shown up in some of Yang's later works).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} He married Taiwanese pop-singer and music legend [[Tsai Chin (singer)|Tsai Chin]] in May 1985.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} They divorced in August 1995, and he subsequently married pianist Kai-Li Peng.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Films and work==

===''The Winter of 1905'' and ''In Our Time'' (short, ''Desires'')===
Yang eventually returned to Taiwan to write the script for and serve as a production aide on a Hong Kong TV Movie, ''The Winter of 1905'' (1981). After directing a series of television shows, Yang's break came in 1982 when he was asked to direct and write a short, "Desires" (also known as "Expectation"), in the seminal Taiwanese New Wave collection ''In Our Time'' (1982). The short film was a rather poignant portrayal of a young girl's experiences through puberty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===''That Day, on The Beach''===
Yang then followed that short with several of his major works. While his contemporary [[Hou Hsiao-Hsien]] focused more on the countryside, Yang was a poet of the city, analyzing the environment and relationships of urban Taiwan in nearly all his films. Yang's first feature film, ''That Day, on the Beach'' (1983), was a fractured modernist narrative reflecting on couples and families that spliced time-lines.

===''Taipei Story''===
Yang followed with his second feature film, ''[[Taipei Story]]'' (1985), where he cast fellow auteur [[Hou Hsiao-Hsien]] as the lead, a former Little-League baseball star trying to find his way in Taipei.

===''The Terrorizers''===
Yang's third feature film was ''[[The Terrorizers (movie)|The Terrorizers]]'' (1986), a complex multi-narrative urban thriller that reflected on city life and contained the crime elements and alienation themes of an Antonioni film. The film won a Silver Leopard at The [[Locarno International Film Festival]]<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091355/awards |title=IMDB: Awards of The Terrorizers |accessdate=2009-10-13|work=imdb.com}}</ref> and was examined by [[Fredric Jameson]] in ''The Geopolitical Aesthetic''.<ref>Jameson, Fredric, The Geopolitical Aesthetic. “Remapping Taipei.” London: BFI Publishing, 1992, pp. 114-157.</ref>

===''A Brighter Summer Day''===
Yang's fourth film was ''[[A Brighter Summer Day (1991 film)|A Brighter Summer Day]]'' (1991), a sprawling examination of youth-teen gangs, 1949 Taiwanese societal developments, and American [[pop culture|pop-culture]] (the title was taken from an [[Elvis Priestley|Elvis]] refrain);<ref name=ID/> the film was considered by many critics to be a masterpiece. For ''A Brighter Summer Day,'' Yang won the [[FIPRESCI]] Prize at The [[Tokyo International Film Festival]], and a [[Golden Horse]] award for Best Film.

===''A Confucian Confusion''===
Yang's fifth film was ''[[A Confucian Confusion]]'' (1994), a multi-character comedy set in urban Taiwan), which garnered a [[Golden Horse]] Award for Best Screenplay Originally Written for The Screen.

===''Mahjong''===
Yang's sixth film was ''[[Mahjong (1996 film)|Mahjong]]'' (1996), a sharp, incisive reflection of modern urban-Taiwan seen through foreign eyes, which also starred several foreign actors, which won an Honourable Mention at the [[46th Berlin International Film Festival]]<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1996/03_preistr_ger_1996/03_Preistraeger_1996.html |title=Berlinale: 1996 Prize Winners |accessdate=2012-01-01 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> and garnered Yang a "Best Asian Director" Award at The [[Singapore International Film Festival]].<ref name="IMDB">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116962/awards |title=IMDB: Awards of Mahjong |accessdate=2009-10-13|work=imdb.com}}</ref>

===''Yi Yi''===
However, Yang was most likely known for his seventh and final film, ''[[Yi Yi]]'' (2000) - it was for this film that he received the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director]] at Cannes in 2000, among other notable film awards. ''Yi Yi'' was an epic story about the Jian family seen through three different perspectives: the father NJ ([[Nien-Jen Wu]]), the son Yang-Yang (Jonathan Chang), and the daughter, Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee).<ref name="imdb.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244316/ |title=IMDB: Yi Yi: A One and a Two |accessdate=2009-10-13|work=imdb.com}}</ref> The three-hour piece started with a wedding, concluded with a funeral, and contemplated all areas of human life in-between with profound humor, beauty and tragedy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Legacy===
In 2000, Yang formed Miluku Technology & Entertainment to produce animated films and TV shows. The first animated feature that Miluku was slated to produce was an animated feature titled ''The Wind'' with [[Jackie Chan]] in 2007, but the project was cut short when Yang fell ill with cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2007/07/01/filmmaker_edward_yang_dies_at_59/3558/|title=UPI, "Filmmaker Edward Yang dies at 59" July 1, 2007}}</ref> At the 2007 [[Pusan International Film Festival#Asian Filmmaker of the Year|Pusan International Film Festival]], he won an award for Asian Filmmaker of the Year. He died on June 29, 2007, at his home in Beverly Hills, as a result of complications from a seven-year struggle with [[colon cancer]]. He is survived by his wife, concert pianist Kaili Peng, and son Sean.

==Themes==
{{Section OR|date=October 2009}}
Yang attempted to examine the struggle between the modern and the traditional in his films, as well as the relationship between business and art, and how greed may corrupt, influence, or affect art. For that reason, many of his films (other than ''Yi Yi'') are extremely difficult to find, since Yang did not consider selling films for money his primary purpose as an artist.

Also, Yang always set his works in the cities of Taiwan. As a result, Yang's films - especially ''A Confucian Confusion,'' ''Taipei Story,'' ''Mahjong'' and ''The Terrorizers,'' are commentaries on Taiwanese urban life and insightful explorations of Taiwanese urban society.

He has also collaborated with many of his fellow Taiwanese film-makers in his films: for instance, in ''Yi Yi'' he cast as the lead well-known auteur, novelist, and screenwriter [[Nien-Jen Wu]], director of the award-winning ''Duo Sang'', or ''A Borrowed Life'', which [[Martin Scorsese]] has cited as one of his favorite works and one of the most influential films of the '90s. He also cast fellow film-maker [[Hou Hsiao-Hsien]] as the lead in his 1985 film, ''[[Taipei Story]]''. Yang also taught Theatre and Film classes at the Taipei National University of the Arts. Several of his students showed up in his films as actors and actresses.
