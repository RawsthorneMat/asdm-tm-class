'''Friedrich Christian Anton "Fritz" Lang''' (December 5, 1890 – August 2, 1976) was a [[Germans|German]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] filmmaker, screenwriter, and occasional film producer and actor.<ref name="WVobit">Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', August 4, 1976, page 63.</ref> One of the best known ''émigrés'' from Germany's school of [[German Expressionism|Expressionism]], he was dubbed the "Master of Darkness" by the [[British Film Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/lang/|title=Fritz Lang: Master of Darkness|accessdate=January 22, 2009|quote=|publisher=[[British Film Institute]] }}</ref>

His most famous films include the groundbreaking ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (the world's most expensive silent film at the time of its release), and ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'', made before he moved to the United States, which is considered a precursor to the [[film noir]] genre. Fritz Lang played himself in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]’s film ''Contempt''.<ref>[http://eurochannel.com/en/A-Film-and-Its-Era-Contempt-by-Jean-Luc-Godard-Antoine-de-Gaudemar-France.html Presentation of A Film and Its Era: Contempt by Jean-Luc Godard]</ref>

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Lang was born in [[Vienna]] as the second son of Anton Lang (1860–1940),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.architektenlexikon.at/de/345.htm |title=Architekturzentrum Wien |publisher=Architektenlexikon.at |date= |accessdate=March 6, 2010}}</ref> an architect and construction company manager, and his wife Pauline "Paula" Lang née Schlesinger (1864–1920). Fritz Lang was baptized on December 28, 1890, at the [[Schottenstift, Vienna|Schottenkirche]] in Vienna.<ref>Vienna, Schottenpfarre, baptismal register Tom. 1890, fol. 83.</ref>

Lang's parents were of [[Moravia]]n{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} descent and practicing [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. His parents (his mother was a Jewish born converted Roman Catholic) took their religion seriously and were dedicated to raising Fritz as a Catholic. Lang frequently had Catholic-influenced themes in his films.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast|year=1998|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9780312194543|page=477|author=Patrick Mcgilligan|accessdate=April 8, 2013|quote=In the final years of his life, Lang had written, in German, a 20- to 30-page short story called "The Wandering Jew." It was "a kind of fable about a Wandering Jew," according to Pierre Rissient. After Lang's death, Rissient asked Latte [Fritz Lang's third wife] if he might arrange for its publication. "No," she replied, "because Fritz would want to be known as an atheist."}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The films of Fritz Lang: allegories of vision and modernity|year=2000|publisher=British Film Institute|isbn=9780851707426|authors=Tom Gunning, British Film Institute|accessdate=August 13, 2012|page=7|quote=Lang, however, immediately cautions Prokosh, 'Jerry, don't forget, the gods have not created men, man has created the gods.'}}</ref> Late in life, he described himself as "born Catholic".<ref>{{cite book|last=Lang|first=Fritz|title=Fritz Lang: Interviews|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xxX-epJIzo0C&pg=PA163&|page=163}}</ref>

After finishing school, Lang briefly attended the [[Technical University of Vienna]], where he studied civil engineering and eventually switched to art. In 1910 he left [[Vienna]] to see the world, traveling throughout Europe and Africa and later Asia and the [[Pacific]] area. In 1913, he studied painting in Paris, France.

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], Lang returned to [[Vienna]] and volunteered for military service in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] army and fought in Russia and [[Romania]], where he was wounded three times. While recovering from his injuries and [[combat stress reaction|shell shock]] in 1916, he wrote some scenarios and ideas for films. He was discharged from the army with the rank of lieutenant in 1918 and did some acting in the Viennese theater circuit for a short time before being hired as a writer at Decla, [[Erich Pommer]]'s Berlin-based production company.

===Expressionist films: the Weimar years (1918–1933)===
Lang's writing stint was brief, as he soon started to work as a director at the German film studio [[Universum Film AG|Ufa]], and later [[Nero-Film]], just as the [[German Expressionism|Expressionist]] movement was building. In this first phase of his career, Lang alternated between films such as ''[[Der Müde Tod]]'' ("The Weary Death") and popular thrillers such as ''[[Die Spinnen]]'' ("The Spiders"), combining popular genres with Expressionist techniques to create an unprecedented synthesis of popular entertainment with [[art film|art cinema]].

In 1920, he met his future wife, the writer and actress [[Thea von Harbou]]. She and Lang co-wrote all of his movies from 1921 through 1933, including ''[[Dr. Mabuse, der Spieler]]'' (Dr. Mabuse the Gambler; 1922), which ran for over four hours in two parts in the original version and was the first in the [[Dr. Mabuse]] trilogy, the five-hour ''[[Die Nibelungen: Siegfried|Die Nibelungen]]'' (1924), the famous 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', the science fiction film ''[[Woman in the Moon]]'' (1929), and the 1931 classic, ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'', his first "[[talkie|talking]]" picture.

[[File:Fritz Lang und Thea von Harbou, 1923 od. 1924.jpg|thumb|Fritz Lang and Thea von Harbou in their Berlin flat, 1923 or 1924]]

Considered by many film scholars to be his masterpiece, ''M'' is a disturbing story of a child murderer ([[Peter Lorre]] in his first starring role) who is hunted down and brought to rough justice by Berlin's criminal underworld. ''M'' remains a powerful work; it was [[M (1951 film)|remade]] in 1951 by [[Joseph Losey]], but this version had little impact on audiences, and has become harder to see than the original film.

During the climactic final scene in ''M'', Lang allegedly threw Peter Lorre down a flight of stairs in order to give more authenticity to Lorre's battered look. Lang, who was known for being hard to work with, epitomized the stereotype of the tyrannical German film director, a type embodied also by [[Erich von Stroheim]] and [[Otto Preminger]]. His wearing a [[monocle]] added to the stereotype.

In the films of his German period, Lang produced a coherent [[oeuvre]] that established the characteristics later attributed to ''[[film noir]]'', with its recurring themes of psychological conflict, paranoia, fate and moral ambiguity.

At the end of 1932, Lang started filming ''[[The Testament of Dr. Mabuse]]''. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in January 1933, and by March 30, the new regime banned it as an incitement to public disorder. ''Testament'' is sometimes deemed an anti-Nazi film as Lang had put phrases used by the Nazis into the mouth of the title character.

Lang was worried about the advent of the Nazi regime, partly because of his Jewish heritage,<ref name="religion">{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pl/Fritz_Lang.html|title=The religion of director Fritz Lang|accessdate=January 22, 2009}}</ref> whereas his wife and screen writer [[Thea von Harbou]] had started to sympathize with the Nazis in the early 1930s and joined the [[NSDAP]] in 1932. They soon divorced. Lang's fears would be realized following his departure from Austria, as under the [[Nuremberg Laws]] he would be identified as a Jew even though his mother was a converted Roman Catholic, and he was raised as such.

===Emigration===
Shortly afterwards, Lang left Germany. According to Lang, propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] called Lang to his offices to inform him that ''[[The Testament of Dr Mabuse]]'' was being banned but that he was nevertheless so impressed by Lang's abilities as a filmmaker (especially ''Metropolis''), he was offering Lang a position as the head of German film studio [[Universum Film AG|UFA]]. Lang had stated that it was during this meeting that he had decided to leave for Paris – but that the banks had closed by the time the meeting was over. Lang has stated that he fled that very evening.<ref>Michel Ciment: ''Fritz Lang, Le meurtre et la loi, Ed. Gallimard, Collection Découvertes, 04/11/2003. The author thinks that this meeting, in fact, never happened.</ref><ref>[[Allan Havis|Havis, Allan]] (2008), ''Cult Films: Taboo and Transgression'', University Press of America, Inc., page 10</ref><ref>Thomson, David (2012) ''The Big Screen: the story of the movies'' New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux ISBN 9780374191894 pages 64-65 Lang's version suspect</ref>

Lang left Germany in 1934 and moved to Paris<ref name="KalatDVD">David Kalat, ''[http://www.criterion.com/films/721 DVD Commentary for The Testament of Dr. Mabuse]''. New York City, United States: The Criterion Collection (2004)</ref> after his marriage to [[Thea von Harbou]], who stayed behind, ended in 1933.<ref name="howard hughes">{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Howard|title=Outer Limits: The Filmgoers' Guide to the Great Science-fiction Films|date=2014|publisher=I.B.Tauris|location=NY|isbn=1780761651|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_h9AwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>

In Paris, Lang filmed a version of [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s ''[[Liliom (1934 film)|Liliom]]'', starring [[Charles Boyer]]. This was Lang's only film in French (not counting the [[The Testament of Dr. Mabuse#French version|French version of ''Testament'']]). He then went to the United States.<ref name="KalatDVD"/>

===Hollywood career (1936–1957)===
In Hollywood, Lang signed first with [[MGM]] Studios.  His first American film was the crime drama ''[[Fury (1936 film)|Fury]]'', which starred [[Spencer Tracy]] as a man who is wrongly accused of a crime and nearly killed when a lynch mob sets fire to the jail where he is awaiting trial.  Lang became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1939. He made twenty-three features in his 20-year American career, working in a variety of genres at every major studio in Hollywood, and occasionally producing his films as an independent. Lang's American films were often compared unfavorably to his earlier works by contemporary critics, but the restrained Expressionism of these films is now seen as integral to the emergence and evolution of American genre cinema, ''[[film noir]]'' in particular.

One of his most famous ''films noir'' is the police drama ''[[The Big Heat]]'' (1953), noted for its uncompromising brutality, especially for a scene in which [[Lee Marvin]] throws scalding coffee on [[Gloria Grahame]]'s face. As Lang's visual style simplified, in part due to the constraints of the Hollywood studio system, his worldview became increasingly pessimistic, culminating in the cold, geometric style of his last American films, ''[[While the City Sleeps (1956 film)|While the City Sleeps]]'' (1956) and ''[[Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (1956 film)|Beyond a Reasonable Doubt]]'' (1956).

Finding it difficult to find congenial production conditions and backers in Hollywood, particularly as his health declined with age, Lang contemplated retirement. The German producer [[Artur Brauner]] had expressed interest in remaking ''[[The Indian Tomb (1921 film)|The Indian Tomb]]'' (a story that Lang had developed in the 1920s which had ultimately been directed by [[Joe May]]),.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Plass|first=Ulrich| title = Dialectic of Regression: Theador W Adorno and Fritz Lang| journal = [[Telos (journal)|Telos]]| volume = 149 | page = 131 | date = Winter 2009}}</ref>  So Lang returned to Germany,<ref name="gold195912">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1959-12/Galaxy_1959_12#page/n5/mode/2up | title=Of All Things | work=Galaxy | date=1959-12 | accessdate=15 June 2014 | author=Gold, H. L. | pages=6}}</ref> to make his "Indian Epic" (consisting of ''[[The Tiger of Eschnapur (1959 film)|The Tiger of Eschnapur]]'' and ''[[The Indian Tomb (1959 film)|The Indian Tomb]]''). Following the production, Brauner was  preparing for a remake of ''[[The Testament of Dr. Mabuse]]'' when Lang approached him with the idea of adding a new original film to the series. The result was ''[[The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse]]'' (1960), whose success led to a series of new Mabuse films, which were produced by Brauner (including the remake of ''The Testament of Dr. Mabuse''), though Lang did not direct any of the sequels. ''[[The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse]]'' can be viewed as the marriage between the director's early experiences with expressionist techniques in Germany with the spartan style already visible in his late American work.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Lang was approaching blindness during the production,<ref>[[Robert Bloch]]. "In Memoriam: Fritz Lang" in Bloch's ''Out of My Head''. Cambridge MA: NESFA Press, 1986, 171–80</ref> and it was his final project as director.  In 1963, he appeared as himself in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s film [[Contempt (film)|Contempt]].

===Death and legacy===
[[File:Fritz Lang (1969).jpg|thumb|Fritz Lang (1969)]]
While his career had ended without fanfare, his American and later German works were championed by the critics of the ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', such as [[François Truffaut]] and [[Jacques Rivette]]. Truffaut wrote that Lang, especially in his American career, was greatly underappreciated by "cinema historians and critics" who "deny him any genius when he 'signs' spy movies ... war movies ... or simple thrillers."<ref>Dixon, Wheeler Winston (1993). ''Early Film Criticism of Francois Truffaut''. Indiana University Press. pp. 41–42. ISBN 0253113431.</ref> Filmmakers that were influenced by his work include Jacques Rivette and [[William Friedkin]].

Lang died in 1976 and was interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn – Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|first=Albin|last=Krebs|authorlink=|title=Fritz Lang, Film Director Noted for 'M,' Dead at 85|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0617FF3F5A167493C1A91783D85F428785F9|quote=Friz Lang, the Viennese-born film director best known for "M", a terrifying study of a child killer, and for other tales of suspense, died yesterday in Los Angeles at the age of 85.
