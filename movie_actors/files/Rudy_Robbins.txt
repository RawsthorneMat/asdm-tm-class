'''Rudy Warner Robbins''' (November 17, 1933 – February 21, 2011) was a [[Western (genre)|Western]] entertainer known for his [[singing]], [[songwriting]], [[acting]], [[writing]], and his past performance of [[film]] and [[television]] [[stunts]].

==Early years, education, military==

Rudy Robbins was the youngest of four children born in [[Evergreen, Louisiana|Evergreen]] in [[Avoyelles Parish]] in south central [[Louisiana]] to Charles Robbins, a native of [[Mississippi]], and the former Mary Alice Grimble. When he was two years old, the family moved to [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] on the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Texas Gulf Coast]], where he was reared. He graduated in 1952 from [[Memorial High School (Port Arthur, Texas)|Thomas Jefferson High School]], now known as Memorial High School, and then, for one academic year, attended [[Lamar University]] in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], [[Texas]], known at the time as Lamar Technical Institute. Himself a [[Baptist]], Robbins graduated in 1956 from [[East Texas Baptist University]] in [[Marshall, Texas|Marshall]] in east Texas with credentials in [[business administration]] and [[sociology]].<ref name=museum>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofthegulfcoast.org/personalities-notable-people-rudy-robbins.html |title=Personalities - Notable People - Rudy Robbins |publisher=Museum of the Gulf Coast |date= |accessdate=2013-01-09}}</ref>

From 1957-1959, Robbins served in the [[United States Army]] and was on the Fourth Army [[track and field|track]] team. He set a record for the [[javelin throw]], the same event in which he had lettered at ETBU. In the Army, he met the son of a [[film]] [[Film producer|producer]] who told him about job opportunities in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] as a stuntman.

==Moving to Bandera, Texas==

After military service, Robbins moved to Bandera, a small community west of [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] which calls itself "The Cowboy Capital of the World". He worked there for a time as a [[Wrangler (profession)|wrangler]] at the Dixie [[Dude Ranch]] until he was offered a speaking but unnamed role as one of the [[Tennessee]] Volunteers in [[John Wayne]]'s [[epic film|epic]] ''[[The Alamo (1960 film)|The Alamo]]'', which was filmed not in San Antonio but near [[Brackettville, Texas|Brackettville]] in [[Kinney County, Texas|Kinney County]] in south central Texas. In ''The Alamo'', Robbins was involved in a short [[dialogue]] repeated several times during the film: a fellow-Tennessean would review a developing situation and ask Robbins, "Do this mean what I think it do?" Robbins would reply, "It do." Thereafter, John Wayne called Robbins by the nickname "It Do"; one of Robbins' treasured possessions is a [[souvenir]] Alamo [[mug]] addressed to "It Do" from "Duke", Wayne's nickname.<ref name=thcm>"Rudy Robbins", ''Texas Hill Country Magazine'', [[Winter]] 2007:http://www.hillcountrymagazine.com/issues/20074/128.php {{dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref>

After ''The Alamo'', Robbins went to Hollywood but returned semi-permanently to Bandera in 1971 though he was on tour for many of the following years.

==Acting and stunts==

Wayne introduced Robbins to legendary [[Film director|director]] [[John Ford]], who hired him as an actor in ''[[Two Rode Together]]'' with [[James Stewart]] and [[Richard Widmark]] (also filmed near Brackettville) and later for stunts in ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'', also with Widmark, and in three other Wayne films, ''[[McLintock!]]'' with [[Maureen O'Hara]]), ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' and ''[[Rio Lobo]]'' (1970).<ref name=museum/> Robbins' other  parts were for uncredited stunts in ''[[The Rounders (1965 film)|The Rounders]]'' (1965) and ''[[Sugarland Express]]'' (1974). He also appeared as a [[mechanic]] in ''Sugarland Express''. He did stunts for [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]]'s ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' in 1964, acting as a double for series star [[James Arness]].<ref name=thcm/>

In 1966, Robbins played Josh Cutler in [[NBC]]'s ''[[Daniel Boone (TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' with [[Fess Parker]].<ref>Internet Movie Database:http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0730454/</ref> Robbins holds Parker, later a large [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[real estate developer|developer]], in high esteem because Parker paid him in advance: "He knew I was hard up. When I showed up on Monday morning, he handed me an envelope with my first episode’s pay in advance," recalls Robbins.<ref name=thcm/>

Along with Wayne, [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Charlton Heston]], Robbins was awarded honorary membership in the Stuntmen's Association of Motion Pictures. Robbins also trained [[horse]]s for other stuntmen and became a production manager for various shows.<ref name=museum/>

==Later activities==

In 1967, he was selected by the [[United States Department of Commerce]] to go to [[Europe]] as a "Cowboy Goodwill Ambassador" to introduce and promote the sale of [[denim]] jeans.<ref name=museum/>

Later, he joined [[Montie Montana]], Jr., to re-create [[Buffalo Bill]]'s Wild West Show. With a cast of 125 [[cowboy]]s, cowgirls, and Indians and 135 [[bison]], [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|longhorns]], and horses, the show toured worldwide from [[London, England|London]] to [[Brazil]] to [[Singapore]]. The group was particularly well received in [[Japan]], where it performed four to five shows daily for four months. The last wild west show performance was near [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in northern [[Montana]]. Back in Texas, Robbins produced the Rudy Robbins Western Show and the All American Cowboy Get-Together, a two-day event of music, [[poetry]], [[cooking]], arts, crafts and demonstrations.<ref name=museum/> He was also active in the "Keep Bandera Western" campaign.<ref name=thcm/>

Robbins formed '''The Spirit of Texas''', a western harmony group, which in 1991 was named by the [[Texas State Senate]] as the "Official Cowboy Band for Texas". Modeled on the old [[Sons of the Pioneers]], the band performed for such celebrities as [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Dale Evans Rogers]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[June Carter|June Carter Cash]], and [[Tom Selleck]], as well as [[General]] [[H. Norman Schwarzkopf]] and Texas [[Governors]] [[Ann W. Richards]] and [[George W. Bush]].<ref name=thcm/> Robbins and the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[yodeler]] [[Shirley Field]] co-authored ''How to Yodel the Cowboy Way''.<ref>Robbins and Shirley Field, ''How to Yodel the Cowboy Way'': http://www.amazon.com/How-Yodel-Cowboy-Rudy-Robbins/dp/1574240358</ref> After the death of two members, the Spirit of Texas disbanded.

Robbins also wrote [[short story|short stories]] for ''Cowboy Magazine''. He is featured in the [[Museum of the Gulf Coast]], which is administered by the Port Arthur Historical Society.<ref name=museum/> He lived in Bandera in the [[Texas Hill Country]].

Among his awards, Robbins was made honorary town [[marshal]] of [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona]], honorary deputy [[sheriff]] of [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] ([[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]), Arizona, and "Outstanding Cowboy of the 20th Century" for [[Bandera County, Texas|Bandera County]], Texas. He was commissioned an admiral in the Texas Navy by former Governor [[Bill Clements]]. He was awarded a plaque for excellence by the Texas Stuntmen's Association.

Robbins died of cancer at the age of 77. His graver marker reads, "A Western Showman Who Loved The Lord".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} He was survived by a son, Jody, who was born in 1956.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Much of Robbin's memorabilia is now in the Frontier Times Museum in Bandera and the Bandera Library.
