'''Federico Fellini''' ({{IPA-it|fedeˈriːko felˈliːni|lang}}; January 20, 1920 – October 31, 1993) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[film director]] and [[scriptwriter]]. Known for his distinct style that blends fantasy and [[baroque]] images with earthiness, he is considered one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of the 20th century.<ref>Burke and Waller, 12</ref>

In a career spanning almost fifty years, Fellini won the [[Palme d'Or]] for ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', was nominated for twelve [[Academy Awards]], and directed four motion pictures that won [[Oscars]] in the category of Best Foreign Language Film. In 1993, he was awarded an honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement at the 65th Annual Academy Awards in Los Angeles.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000019/awards?ref_=nm_awd]</ref>

==Early life and education==
=== Rimini (1920–1938) ===
Fellini was born on January 20, 1920 to middle-class parents in [[Rimini]], then a small town on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. His father, Urbano Fellini (1894–1956), born to a family of [[Romagna|Romagnol]] peasants and small landholders from [[Gambettola]], moved to [[Rome]] in 1915 as a baker [[apprentice]]d to the Pantanella pasta factory. His mother, Ida Barbiani (1896–1984), came from a bourgeois [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family of Roman merchants. Despite her family’s vehement disapproval, she had eloped with Urbano in 1917 to live at his parents' home in Gambettola.<ref>Alpert, 16</ref> A civil marriage followed in 1918 with the religious ceremony held at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome a year later.

The couple settled in Rimini where Urbano became a [[Vendor (supply chain)|traveling salesman]] and [[wholesale]] [[vendor]]. Fellini had two siblings: Riccardo (1921–1991), a documentary director for [[RAI]] Television, and Maria Maddalena (m. Fabbri; 1929–2002).
In 1924, Fellini started primary school in an institute run by the nuns of San Vincenzo in Rimini, attending the Carlo Tonni public school two years later. An attentive student, he spent his leisure time drawing, staging puppet shows, and reading ''Il corriere dei piccoli'', the popular children’s magazine that reproduced traditional American cartoons by [[Winsor McCay]], [[George McManus]] and [[Frederick Burr Opper]]. (Opper’s [[Happy Hooligan]] would provide the visual inspiration for Gelsomina in Fellini's 1954 film ''[[La Strada]]''; McCay’s ''[[Little Nemo]]'' would directly influence his 1980 film ''[[City of Women]]''.)<ref name="ReferenceA">Bondanella, ''The Films of Federico Fellini'', 7</ref> In 1926, he discovered the world of [[Grand Guignol]], the circus with [[Pierino]] the Clown, and the movies. [[Guido Brignone]]’s ''Maciste all’Inferno'' (1926), the first film he saw, would mark him in ways linked to [[Dante]] and the cinema throughout his entire career.<ref>Burke and Waller, 5-13</ref>

Enrolled at the Ginnasio Giulio Cesare in 1929, he made friends with Luigi ‘Titta’ Benzi, later a prominent Rimini lawyer (and the model for young Titta in ''[[Amarcord]]'' (1973)). In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]’s Italy, Fellini and Riccardo became members of the ''Avanguardista'', the compulsory [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] youth group for males. He visited Rome with his parents for the first time in 1933, the year of the maiden voyage of the transatlantic ocean liner ''[[SS Rex]]'' (which is shown in ''Amarcord''). The sea creature found on the beach at the end of ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960) has its basis in a giant fish marooned on a Rimini beach during a storm in 1934.

Although Fellini adapted key events from his childhood and adolescence in films such as ''[[I Vitelloni]]'' (1953), ''[[8½]]'' (1963), and ''[[Amarcord]]'' (1973), he insisted that such autobiographical memories were inventions: 
<blockquote>"It is not memory that dominates my films. To say that my films are autobiographical is an overly facile liquidation, a hasty classification. It seems to me that I have invented almost everything: childhood, character, nostalgias, dreams, memories, for the pleasure of being able to recount them."<ref>Fellini interview in ''Panorama'' 18 (14 January 1980). Screenwriters [[Tullio Pinelli]] and [[Bernardino Zapponi]], cinematographer [[Giuseppe Rotunno]] and set designer [[Dante Ferretti]] also reported that Fellini imagined many of his “memories”. Cf. Bernardino Zapponi's memoir, ''Il mio Fellini'' and Fellini's own insistence on having created his cinematic autobiography in ''I'm a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon'', 32</ref></blockquote>

In 1937, Fellini opened Febo, a portrait shop in Rimini. with the painter Demos Bonini. His first humorous article appeared in the "Postcards to Our Readers" section of Milan’s ''Domenica del Corriere''. Deciding on a career as a caricaturist and gag writer, Fellini travelled to [[Florence]] in 1938, where he published his first cartoon in the weekly ''420''. Failing his military culture exam, he graduated from high school in July 1938 after doubling the exam.

===Rome (1939)===
In September 1939, he enrolled in law school at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]] to please his parents. Biographer [[Hollis Alpert]] reports that "there is no record of his ever having attended a class".<ref>Alpert, 33</ref> Installed in a family pensione, he met another lifelong friend, the painter Rinaldo Geleng. Desperately poor, they unsuccessfully joined forces to draw sketches of restaurant and café patrons. Fellini eventually found work as a cub reporter on the dailies ''Il Piccolo'' and ''Il Popolo di Roma'' but quit after a short stint, bored by the local court news assignments.

Four months after publishing his first article in ''Marc’Aurelio'', the highly influential biweekly humour magazine, he joined the editorial board, achieving success with a regular column titled ''But Are You Listening?''<ref>Kezich, 31</ref> Described as “the determining moment in Fellini’s life”,<ref>Bondanella, ''The Films of Federico Fellini'', 8</ref> the magazine gave him steady employment between 1939 and 1942, when he interacted with writers, gagmen, and scriptwriters. These encounters eventually led to opportunities in show business and cinema. Among his collaborators on the magazine’s editorial board were the future director [[Ettore Scola]], [[Marxist]] theorist and scriptwriter [[Cesare Zavattini]], and [[Bernardino Zapponi]], a future Fellini screenwriter. Conducting interviews for ''CineMagazzino'' also proved congenial: when asked to interview [[Aldo Fabrizi]], Italy’s most popular variety performer, he established such immediate personal rapport with the man that they collaborated professionally. Specializing in humorous monologues, Fabrizi commissioned material from his young protégé.<ref>Kezich, 55</ref>

==Career and later life==

=== Early screenplays (1940–1943) ===
[[File:Federico Fellini.jpg|thumb|Federico Fellini during the 1950s]]
Retained on business in Rimini, Urbano sent wife and family to Rome in 1940 to share an apartment with his son. Fellini and Ruggero Maccari, also on the staff of ''Marc’Aurelio'', began writing radio sketches and gags for films.

Not yet twenty and with Fabrizi’s help, Fellini obtained his first screen credit as a comedy writer on [[Mario Mattoli]]’s ''[[Il pirata sono io]]'' (''The Pirate's Dream''). Progressing rapidly to numerous collaborations on films at [[Cinecittà]], his circle of professional acquaintances widened to include novelist [[Vitaliano Brancati]] and scriptwriter Piero Tellini. In the wake of Mussolini’s declaration of war against France and England on June 10, 1940, Fellini discovered [[Kafka]]’s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', [[Gogol]], [[John Steinbeck]] and [[William Faulkner]] along with French films by [[Marcel Carné]], [[René Clair]], and [[Julien Duvivier]].<ref>Alpert, 42</ref> In 1941 he published ''Il mio amico Pasqualino'', a 74-page booklet in ten chapters describing the absurd adventures of Pasqualino, an alter ego.<ref>Kezich, 35</ref>

Writing for radio while attempting to avoid the draft, Fellini met his future wife [[Giulietta Masina]] in a studio office at the Italian public radio broadcaster [[Ente Italiano per le Audizioni Radiofoniche|EIAR]] in autumn 1942. Well-paid as the voice of Pallina in Fellini's radio serial, ''Cico and Pallina'', Masina was also well known for her musical-comedy broadcasts which cheered an audience depressed by the war.<ref>"Giulietta is practical, and likes the fact that she earns a handsome fee for her radio work, whereas theater never pays well. And of course the fame counts for something too. Radio is a booming business and comedy reviews have a broad and devoted public." Kezich, 48</ref> In November 1942, Fellini was sent to [[Libya]], occupied by Fascist Italy, to work on the screenplay of ''I cavalieri del deserto'' (''[[Knights of the Desert (film)|Knights of the Desert]]'', 1942), directed by [[Osvaldo Valenti]] and Gino Talamo. Fellini welcomed the assignment as it allowed him "to secure another extension on his draft order".<ref>Kezich, 70</ref> Responsible for emergency re-writing, he also directed the film's first scenes. When [[Tripoli]] fell under siege by British forces, he and his colleagues made a narrow escape by boarding a German military plane flying to [[Sicily]]. His African adventure, later published in ''Marc’Aurelio'' as "The First Flight", marked “the emergence of a new Fellini, no longer just a screenwriter, working and sketching at his desk, but a filmmaker out in the field”.<ref>Kezich, 71</ref>

The [[apolitical]] Fellini was finally freed of the draft when an Allied air raid over [[Bologna]] destroyed his medical records. Fellini and Giulietta hid in her aunt’s apartment until Mussolini's fall on July 25, 1943. After dating for nine months, the couple were married on October 30, 1943. Several months later, Masina fell down the stairs and suffered a miscarriage. She gave birth to a son, Pierfederico, on 22 March 1945 but the child died of [[encephalitis]] a month later on 24 April.<ref>Kezich, 74</ref> The tragedy had enduring emotional and artistic repercussions.<ref>Kezich, 157. Cf. filmed interview with Luigi 'Titta' Benzi in ''[[Fellini: I'm a Born Liar]]'' (2003).</ref>

===Neorealist apprenticeship (1944–1949)===
After the Allied liberation of Rome on June 4, 1944, Fellini and Enrico De Seta opened the Funny Face Shop where they survived the postwar recession drawing caricatures of American soldiers. He became involved with [[Italian Neorealism]] when [[Roberto Rossellini]], at work on ''Stories of Yesteryear'' (later ''[[Rome, Open City]]''), met Fellini in his shop proposing he contribute gags and dialogue for the script . Aware of Fellini’s reputation as Aldo Fabrizi’s “creative muse”,<ref>Kezich, 78</ref> Rossellini also requested he try to convince the actor to play the role of Father Giuseppe Morosini, the parish priest executed by the [[SS]] on April 4, 1944.

In 1947, Fellini and [[Sergio Amidei]] received an Oscar nomination for the screenplay of ''Rome, Open City''.

Working as both screenwriter and assistant director on Rossellini’s ''[[Paisà]]'' (''Paisan'') in 1946, Fellini was entrusted to film the Sicilian scenes in [[Maiori]]. In February 1948, he was introduced to [[Marcello Mastroianni]], then a young theatre actor appearing in a play with Giulietta Masina.<ref>Kezich, 404</ref> Establishing a close working relationship with [[Alberto Lattuada]], Fellini co-wrote the director’s ''[[Senza pietà]]'' (''Without Pity'') and ''[[Il mulino del Po]]'' (''The Mill on the Po''). Fellini also worked with Rossellini on the [[anthology film]] ''[[L'Amore (film)|L'Amore]]'' (1948), co-writing the screenplay and in one segment titled, "The Miracle", acting opposite [[Anna Magnani]]. To play the role of a vagabond rogue mistaken by Magnani for a saint, Fellini had to bleach his black hair blond.

===Early films (1950–1953)===
[[File:Fellini masina delpoggio lattuada 1952.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Fellini, Masina, Carla del Poggio and Alberto Lattuada, 1952]]
In 1950 Fellini co-produced and co-directed with Alberto Lattuada ''[[Variety Lights]]'' (''Luci del varietà''), his first feature film. A backstage comedy set among the world of small-time travelling performers, it featured Giulietta Masina and Lattuada’s wife, [[Carla Del Poggio|Carla del Poggio]]. Its release to poor reviews and limited distribution proved disastrous for all concerned. The production company went bankrupt, leaving both Fellini and Lattuada with debts to pay for over a decade.<ref>Kezich, 114</ref> In February 1950, ''Paisà'' received an Oscar nomination for the screenplay by Rossellini, [[Sergio Amidei]], and Fellini.

After travelling to Paris for a script conference with Rossellini on ''[[Europa '51]]'', Fellini began production on ''[[The White Sheik]]'' in September 1951, his first solo-directed feature. Starring [[Alberto Sordi]] in the title role, the film is a revised version of a treatment first written by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] in 1949 and based on the ''fotoromanzi'', the photographed cartoon strip romances popular in Italy at the time. Producer [[Carlo Ponti]] commissioned Fellini and [[Tullio Pinelli]] to write the script but Antonioni rejected the story they developed. With [[Ennio Flaiano]], they re-worked the material into a light-hearted satire about newlywed couple Ivan and Wanda Cavalli ([[Leopoldo Trieste]], Brunella Bovo) in Rome to visit the Pope. Ivan’s prissy mask of respectability is soon demolished by his wife’s obsession with the White Sheik. Highlighting the music of [[Nino Rota]], the film was selected at Cannes (among the films in competition was [[Orson Welles]]’s ''[[Othello (1952 film)|Othello]]'') and then retracted. Screened at the [[13th Venice International Film Festival]], it was razzed by critics in "the atmosphere of a soccer match”.<ref>Kezich, 128</ref> One reviewer declared that Fellini had “not the slightest aptitude for cinema direction".

In 1953, ''[[I Vitelloni]]'' found favour with the critics and public. Winning the Silver Lion Award in Venice, it secured Fellini’s first international distributor.

===Beyond neorealism (1954–1960)===
Fellini directed ''[[La Strada]]'' based on a script completed in 1952 with Pinelli and Flaiano. During the last three weeks of shooting, Fellini experienced the first signs of severe clinical depression.<ref name="Kezich, 158">Kezich, 158</ref> Aided by his wife, he undertook a brief period of therapy with Freudian psychoanalyst Emilio Servadio.<ref name="Kezich, 158"/>

Fellini cast American actor [[Broderick Crawford]] to interpret the role of an aging swindler in ''[[Il Bidone]]''. Based partly on stories told to him by a petty thief during production of ''La Strada'', Fellini developed the script into a con man’s slow descent towards a solitary death. To incarnate the role’s "intense, tragic face", Fellini’s first choice had been [[Humphrey Bogart]]<ref>Kezich, 167</ref> but after learning of the actor’s lung cancer, chose Crawford after seeing his face on the theatrical poster of ''[[All the King's Men (1949 film)|All the King’s Men]]'' (1949). The film shoot was wrought with difficulties stemming from Crawford’s alcoholism.<ref>Kezich, 168-69</ref> Savaged by critics at the [[16th Venice International Film Festival]], the film did miserable box office and did not receive international distribution until 1964.
[[File:Cinecittà - Teatro 5.jpg|250px|thumb|Cinecittà - Teatro 5, Fellini's favorite studio<ref>{{cite web|title=Our flexible giant.|url=http://www.cinecittastudios.it/en/events/special-events/teatro-5|publisher=Cinecittà Studios|accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref>]]
During the autumn, Fellini researched and developed a treatment based on a film adaptation of [[Mario Tobino]]’s novel, ''The Free Women of Magliano''. Located in a mental institution for women, financial backers considered the subject had no potential and the project was abandoned.

While preparing ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]'' in spring 1956, Fellini learned of his father’s death by cardiac arrest at the age of sixty-two. Produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and starring Giulietta Masina, the film took its inspiration from  news reports of a woman’s severed head retrieved in a lake and stories by Wanda, a shantytown prostitute Fellini met on the set of ''[[Il Bidone]]''.<ref>Kezich, 177</ref> [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] was hired to translate Flaiano and Pinelli’s dialogue into Roman dialect and to supervise researches in the vice-afflicted suburbs of Rome. The movie won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[30th Academy Awards]] and brought Masina the Best Actress Award at Cannes for her performance.

With Pinelli, he developed ''Journey with Anita'' for [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Gregory Peck]]. An "invention born out of intimate truth", the script was based on Fellini's return to Rimini with a mistress to attend his father's funeral.<ref>Kezich, 189</ref> Due to Loren’s unavailability, the project was shelved and resurrected twenty-five years later as ''[[Lovers and Liars]]'' (1981), a comedy directed by [[Mario Monicelli]] with [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Giancarlo Giannini]]. For [[Eduardo De Filippo]], he co-wrote the script of ''[[Fortunella (film)|Fortunella]]'', tailoring the lead role to accommodate Masina’s particular sensibility.

The [[Hollywood on the Tiber]] phenomenon of 1958 in which American studios profited from the cheap studio labour available in Rome provided the backdrop for photojournalists to steal shots of celebrities on the via Veneto.<ref>Alpert, 122</ref> The scandal provoked by Turkish dancer Haish Nana’s improvised striptease at a nightclub captured Fellini’s imagination: he decided to end his latest script-in-progress, ''Moraldo in the City'', with an all-night "orgy" at a seaside villa. Pierluigi Praturlon’s photos of [[Anita Ekberg]] wading fully dressed in the [[Trevi Fountain]] provided further inspiration for Fellini and his scriptwriters. Changing the title of the screenplay to ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', Fellini soon clashed with his producer on casting: the director insisted on the relatively unknown Mastroianni while De Laurentiis wanted [[Paul Newman]] as a hedge on his investment. Reaching an impasse, De Laurentiis sold the rights to publishing mogul [[Angelo Rizzoli]]. Shooting began on March 16, 1959 with Anita Ekberg climbing the stairs to the cupola of Saint Peter’s in a mammoth décor constructed at [[Cinecittà]]. The statue of Christ flown by helicopter over Rome to [[Saint Peter's Square]] was inspired by an actual media event on May 1, 1956, which Fellini had witnessed. The film wrapped August 15 on a deserted beach at [[Passo Oscuro]] with a bloated mutant fish designed by [[Piero Gherardi]].

''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' broke all box office records. Despite scalpers selling tickets at 1000 lire,<ref>Kezich, 208</ref> crowds queued in line for hours to see an “immoral movie” before the censors banned it. At an exclusive [[Milan]] screening on February 5, 1960, one outraged patron spat on Fellini while others hurled insults. Denounced in parliament by right-wing conservatives, undersecretary Domenico Magrì of the Christian Democrats demanded tolerance for the film’s controversial themes.<ref>Kezich, 209</ref> The [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s official press organ, ''[[l'Osservatore Romano]]'', lobbied for censorship while the Board of Roman Parish Priests and the Genealogical Board of Italian Nobility attacked the film. In one documented instance involving favourable reviews written by the Jesuits of San Fedele, defending ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' had severe consequences.<ref>Kezich, 210</ref> In competition at Cannes alongside Antonioni’s ''[[L’Avventura]]'', the film won the [[Cannes Film Festival|Palme d'Or]] awarded by presiding juror [[Georges Simenon]]. The Belgian writer was promptly “hissed at” by the disapproving festival crowd.<ref>Alpert, 145</ref>

===Art films and dreams (1961–1969)===
[[File:Federico Fellini in the Seventies.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Federico Fellini]]
A major discovery for Fellini after his [[Italian neorealism]] period (1950–1959) was the work of [[Carl Jung]]. After meeting Jungian psychoanalyst Dr. Ernst Bernhard in early 1960, he read Jung's autobiography, ''[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]'' (1963). Bernhard also recommended that Fellini consult the ''[[I Ching]]'' and keep a record of his dreams. What Fellini formerly accepted as "his extrasensory perceptions"<ref>Kezich, 224</ref> were now interpreted as psychic manifestations of the unconscious. Bernhard’s focus on Jungian depth psychology proved to be the single greatest influence on Fellini’s mature style and marked the turning point in his work from neorealism to filmmaking that was "primarily oneiric".<ref>Kezich, 227</ref> As a consequence, Jung's seminal ideas on the ''anima'' and the ''animus'', the role of archetypes and the collective unconscious directly influenced such films as ''[[8½]]'' (1963), ''[[Juliet of the Spirits]]'' (1965), ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]'' (1969), ''[[Fellini's Casanova|Casanova]]'' (1976), and ''[[City of Women]]'' (1980).<ref>Bondanella, ''Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 151-54</ref> Other key influences on his work include [[Luis Buñuel]],<ref>"Buñuel is the auteur I feel closest to in terms of an idea of cinema or the tendency to make particular kinds of films." In Fellini and Pettigrew, ''I’m a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon'', 87.</ref> [[Charlie Chaplin]],<ref>“One of Cabiria’s finest moments comes in the movie’s nightclub scene. It begins when the actor’s girlfriend deserts him, and the star picks up Cabiria on the street as a replacement. He whisks her away to the nightclub. Fellini has admitted that this scene owes a debt to Chaplin’s ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931)." Cited in John C. Stubbs, ''Federico Fellini as Auteur: Seven Aspects of his Films'' (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2006), 152-53. Peter Bondanella points out that Gelsomina's costume, makeup, and antics as a clown figure had "clear links to Fellini's past as a cartoonist-imitator of Happy Hooligan and Charlie Chaplin". Cited in Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 104</ref> [[Sergei Eisenstein]],<ref>In his study of ''Fellini Satyricon'', Italian novelist [[Alberto Moravia]] observes that with "the oars of his galleys suspended in the air, Fellini revives for us the lances of the battle in Eisenstein's ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|''Alexander Nevsky'' (film)]]''." Cited in Bondanella (ed), ''Federico Fellini: Essays in Criticism'', 167</ref> [[Buster Keaton]],<ref name="Bondanella">Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 8</ref> [[Laurel and Hardy]],<ref name="Bondanella"/> the [[Marx Brothers]],<ref name="Bondanella" /> and [[Roberto Rossellini]].<ref>“Roberto Rossellini walked into my life at a moment when I needed to make a choice, when I needed someone to show me the path to follow. He was the stationmaster, the green light of providence... He taught me how to thrive on chaos by ignoring it and focusing on what was essential: constructing your film day by day.” Cited in Federico Fellini and [[Damian Pettigrew]], 17-18. In ''Fellini on Fellini'', the director explains that his "meeting with Rossellini was a determining factor... he taught me to make a film as if I were going for a picnic with friends." In ''Fellini on Fellini'' (London: Eyre Methuen, 1976), 99-100</ref>

Exploiting ''La Dolce Vita''’s success, financier Angelo Rizzoli set up Federiz in 1960, an independent film company, for Fellini and production manager Clemente Fracassi to discover and produce new talent. Despite the best intentions, their overcautious editorial and business skills forced the company to close down soon after cancelling Pasolini’s project, ''[[Accattone]]'' (1961).<ref>Kezich, 218-219</ref>

Condemned as a "public sinner"<ref>Kezich, 212</ref> for ''La Dolce Vita'', Fellini responded with ''The Temptations of Doctor Antonio'', a segment in the omnibus ''[[Boccaccio '70]]''. His first colour film, it was the sole project green-lighted at Federiz. Infused with the [[surrealistic]] satire that characterized the young Fellini’s work at ''Marc’Aurelio'', the film ridiculed a crusader against vice, interpreted by [[Peppino De Filippo]], who goes insane trying to censor a billboard of [[Anita Ekberg]] espousing the virtues of milk.

In an October 1960 letter to his colleague Brunello Rondi, Fellini first outlined his film ideas about a man suffering creative block: "Well then - a guy (a writer? any kind of professional man? a theatrical producer?) has to interrupt the usual rhythm of his life for two weeks because of a not-too-serious disease. It’s a warning bell: something is blocking up his system."<ref>Affron, 227</ref> Unclear about the script, its title, and his protagonist’s profession, he scouted locations throughout Italy “looking for the film”<ref>Alpert, 159</ref> in the hope of resolving his confusion. Flaiano suggested ''La bella confusione'' (literally ''The Beautiful Confusion'') as the movie’s title. Under pressure from his producers, Fellini finally settled on ''8½'', a [[self-referential]] title referring principally (but not exclusively)<ref>Kezich, 234 and Affron, 3-4</ref> to the number of films he had directed up to that time.

Giving the order to start production in spring 1962, Fellini signed deals with his producer Rizzoli, fixed dates, had sets constructed, cast Mastroianni, [[Anouk Aimée]], and [[Sandra Milo]] in lead roles, and did screen tests at the Scalera Studios in Rome. He hired [[cinematographer]] [[Gianni Di Venanzo]], among key personnel. But apart from naming his hero Guido Anselmi, he still couldn't decide what his character did for a living.<ref>Alpert, 160</ref> The crisis came to a head in April when, sitting in his Cinecittà office, he began a letter to Rizzoli confessing he had "lost his film" and had to abandon the project. Interrupted by the chief machinist requesting he celebrate the launch of ''8½'', Fellini put aside the letter and went on the set. Raising a toast to the crew, he "felt overwhelmed by shame… I was in a no exit situation. I was a director who wanted to make a film he no longer remembers. And lo and behold, at that very moment everything fell into place. I got straight to the heart of the film. I would narrate everything that had been happening to me. I would make a film telling the story of a director who no longer knows what film he wanted to make".<ref>Fellini, ''Comments on Film'', 161-62</ref>

Shooting began on May 9, 1962. Perplexed by the seemingly chaotic, incessant improvisation on the set, Deena Boyer, the director’s American press officer at the time, asked for a rationale. Fellini told her that he hoped to convey the three levels "on which our minds live: the past, the present, and the conditional - the realm of fantasy".<ref>Alpert, 170</ref>  After shooting wrapped on October 14, [[Nino Rota]] composed various circus marches and fanfares that would later become signature tunes of the maestro’s cinema.<ref>Kezich, 245</ref> Nominated for four Oscars, ''8½'' won awards for best foreign language film and best costume design in black-and-white. In California for the ceremony, Fellini toured [[Disneyland]] with [[Walt Disney]] the day after.

Increasingly attracted to [[parapsychology]], Fellini met the [[Turin]] magician [[Gustavo Rol]] in 1963. Rol, a former banker, introduced him to the world of [[Spiritism]] and [[séances]]. In 1964, Fellini took [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]<ref>A synthetic derivative "fashioned to produce the same effects as the hallucinogenic mushrooms used by Mexican tribes". Kezich, 255</ref> under the supervision of Emilio Servadio, his psychoanalyst during the 1954 production of ''La Strada''.<ref>Kezich, 255</ref> For years reserved about what actually occurred that Sunday afternoon, he admitted in 1992 that
<blockquote>objects and their functions no longer had any significance. All I perceived was perception itself, the hell of forms and figures devoid of human emotion and detached from the reality of my unreal environment. I was an instrument in a virtual world that constantly renewed its own meaningless image in a living world that was itself perceived outside of nature. And since the appearance of things was no longer definitive but limitless, this paradisiacal awareness freed me from the reality external to my self. The fire and the rose, as it were, became one.<ref>Fellini and Pettigrew, 91</ref></blockquote>

Fellini's hallucinatory insights were given full flower in his first colour feature ''[[Juliet of the Spirits]]'' (1965), depicting [[Giulietta Masina]] as Juliet, a housewife who rightly suspects her husband's infidelity and succumbs to the voices of spirits summoned during a séance at her home.   Her sexually voracious next door neighbor Suzy ([[Sandra Milo]]) introduces Juliet to a world of uninhibited sensuality but Juliet is haunted by childhood memories of her [[Catholic guilt]] and a teenaged friend who committed suicide.  Complex and filled with psychological symbolism, the film is set to a jaunty score by [[Nino Rota]].

=== Nostalgia, sexuality, and politics (1970–1980) ===

To help promote [[Fellini Satyricon|''Satyricon'']] in the United States, Fellini flew to Los Angeles in January 1970 for interviews with [[Dick Cavett]] and [[David Frost]]. He also met with film director [[Paul Mazursky]] who wanted to star him alongside [[Donald Sutherland]] in his new film, ''[[Alex in Wonderland]]''.<ref>Kezich, 410</ref> In February, Fellini scouted locations in Paris for ''[[The Clowns (film)|The Clowns]]'', a docu-fiction for television based on his childhood memories of the circus and a "coherent theory of clowning."<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini,'' 192</ref> As he saw it, the clown "was always the caricature of a well-established, ordered, peaceful society. But today all is temporary, disordered, grotesque. Who can still laugh at clowns?... All the world plays a clown now."<ref>Alpert, 224</ref>

In March 1971, Fellini began production on ''[[Roma (1972 film)|Roma]]'', a seemingly random collection of episodes informed by the director's memories and impressions of Rome. The "diverse sequences," writes Fellini scholar [[Peter Bondanella]], "are held together only by the fact that they all ultimately originate from the director’s fertile imagination."<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini,'' 193</ref> The film’s opening scene anticipates ''Amarcord'' while its most surreal sequence involves an ecclesiastical fashion show in which nuns and priests roller skate past shipwrecks of cobwebbed skeletons.

Over a period of six months between January and June 1973, Fellini shot the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Amarcord]]''. Loosely based on the director’s 1968 autobiographical essay ''My Rimini'',<ref>Alpert, 239</ref> the film depicts the adolescent Titta and his friends working out their sexual frustrations against the religious and Fascist backdrop of a provincial town in Italy during the 1930s. Produced by [[Franco Cristaldi]], the [[seriocomic]] movie became Fellini’s second biggest commercial success after ''La Dolce Vita''.<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini,'' 265</ref> Circular in form, ''Amarcord'' avoids plot and linear narrative in a way similar to ''The Clowns'' and ''Roma''.<ref>Alpert, 242</ref> The director's overriding concern with developing a poetic form of cinema was first outlined in a 1965 interview he gave to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' journalist [[Lillian Ross (journalist)|Lillian Ross]]: "I am trying to free my work from certain constrictions – a story with a beginning, a development, an ending. It should be more like a poem with metre and cadence."<ref>Bondanella, ''Federico Fellini: Essays in Criticism'', 104</ref>

===Late films and projects (1981–1990)===
[[File:Sandro Pertini David Donatello.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Italian President [[Sandro Pertini]] receiving a [[David di Donatello]] Award from Fellini in 1985]]
Organized by his publisher [[Diogenes Verlag]] in 1982, the first major exhibition of 63 drawings by Fellini was held in [[Paris]], [[Brussels]], and the [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery in [[New York]].<ref>Kezich, 413. Also cf. [http://www.warsawvoice.pl/view/13135/ The Warsaw Voice]</ref> A gifted caricaturist, much of the inspiration for his sketches was derived from his own dreams while the films-in-progress both originated from and stimulated drawings for characters, decor, costumes and set designs. Under the title, ''I disegni di Fellini'' (Fellini’s Designs), he published 350 drawings executed in pencil, watercolours, and felt pens.<ref>Fellini, ''I disegni di Fellini'' (Roma: Editori Laterza), 1993. The drawings are edited and analysed by Pier Marco De Santi. For comparing Fellini's graphic work with those of [[Sergei Eisenstein]], consult S.M. Eisenstein, ''Dessins secrets'' (Paris: Seuil), 1999.</ref>

On September 6, 1985 Fellini was awarded the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the 42nd Venice Film Festival. That same year, he became the first non-American to receive the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]]’s annual award for cinematic achievement.

Long fascinated by [[Carlos Castaneda]]’s ''[[The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge]]'', Fellini accompanied the Peruvian author on a journey to the [[Yucatán]] to assess the feasibility of a film. After first meeting Castaneda in Rome in October 1984, Fellini drafted a treatment with Pinelli titled ''Viaggio a Tulun''. Producer [[Alberto Grimaldi]], prepared to buy film rights to all of Castaneda’s work, then paid for pre-production research taking Fellini and his entourage from Rome to [[Los Angeles]] and the jungles of [[Mexico]] in October 1985.<ref>Kezich, 360-61</ref> When Castaneda inexplicably disappeared and the project fell through, Fellini’s mystico-shamanic adventures were scripted with Pinelli and serialized in ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' in May 1986. A barely veiled satirical interpretation of Castaneda's work,<ref>Kezich, 362</ref> ''Viaggio a Tulun'' was published in 1989 as a graphic novel with artwork by [[Milo Manara]] and as ''Trip to Tulum'' in America in 1990.

For ''[[Intervista]]'', produced by Ibrahim Moussa and RAI Television, Fellini intercut memories of the first time he visited [[Cinecittà]] in 1939 with present-day footage of himself at work on a screen adaptation of [[Franz Kafka]]’s ''[[Amerika (novel)|Amerika]]''. A meditation on the nature of memory and film production, it won the special 40th Anniversary Prize at Cannes and the [[15th Moscow International Film Festival]] Golden Prize. In Brussels later that year, a panel of thirty professionals from eighteen European countries named Fellini the world’s best director and ''8½'' the best European film of all time.<ref>Burke and Waller, xvi</ref>

In early 1989 Fellini began production on ''[[The Voice of the Moon]]'', based on Ermanno Cavazzoni’s novel, ''Il poema dei lunatici'' (''The Lunatics’ Poem''). A small town was built at Empire Studios on the via Pontina outside Rome. Starring [[Roberto Benigni]] as Ivo Salvini, a madcap poetic figure newly released from a mental institution, the character is a combination of ''La Strada'''s Gelsomina, [[Pinocchio]], and Italian poet [[Giacomo Leopardi]].<ref>Bondanella, ''Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 330</ref> Fellini improvised as he filmed, using as a guide a rough treatment written with Pinelli.<ref>Kezich, 383</ref> Despite its modest critical and commercial success in Italy, and its warm reception by French critics, it failed to interest North American distributors.

Fellini won the ''[[Praemium Imperiale]]'', the equivalent of the [[Nobel Prize]] in the visual arts, awarded by the Japan Art Association in 1990.<ref>Kezich, 387. The award covers five disciplines: painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and theatre/film. Other winners include [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[David Hockney]], [[Balthus]], [[Pina Bausch]], and [[Maurice Béjart]].</ref>

===Final years (1991–1993)===
In July 1991 and April 1992, Fellini worked in close collaboration with Canadian filmmaker [[Damian Pettigrew]] to establish "the longest and most detailed conversations ever recorded on film".<ref>Peter Bondanella, Review of ''Fellini: I'm a Born Liar'' in ''Cineaste Magazine'' (September 22, 2003), 32</ref> Described as the "Maestro's spiritual testament” by his biographer [[Tullio Kezich]],<ref>Kezich, "Forward" in ''I'm a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon'', 5. Also cf. Kezich, 388</ref> excerpts culled from the conversations later served as the basis of their feature documentary, ''[[Fellini: I'm a Born Liar]]'' (2002) and the book, ''[[I'm a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon]]''.  Finding it increasingly difficult to secure financing for feature films, Fellini developed a suite of television projects whose titles reflect their subjects: ''Attore'', ''Napoli'', ''L’Inferno'', ''L’opera lirica'', and ''L’America''.

In April 1993, Fellini received his fifth [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for lifetime achievement "in recognition of his cinematic accomplishments that have thrilled and entertained audiences worldwide". On June 16, he entered the Cantonal Hospital in [[Zurich]] for an "[[angioplasty]] on his [[femoral artery]]"<ref>Kezich, 396</ref> but suffered a [[stroke]] at the Grand Hotel in Rimini two months later. Partially paralyzed, he was first transferred to [[Ferrara]] for rehabilitation and then to the [[Policlinico Umberto I]] in Rome to be near his wife, also hospitalized. He suffered a second stroke and fell into an irreversible [[coma]]. Fellini died in Rome on October 31 at the age of 73, a day after his fiftieth wedding anniversary. The memorial service was held in Studio 5 at Cinecittà attended by an estimated "70,000 people".<ref>Kezich, 416</ref> At the request of [[Giulietta Masina]], trumpeter [[Mauro Maur]] played the "Improvviso dell'Angelo" by [[Nino Rota]] during the funeral ceremony.<ref>[http://www.santamariadegliangeliroma.it/paginamastersing.html?codice_url=fellini_funerali&lingua=ITALIANO&ramo_home=Eventi The Funerals of Federico Fellini]</ref> Five months later on March 23, 1994, Giulietta Masina died of lung cancer.

Fellini, Masina and their son Pierfederico are buried in a bronze sepulchre sculpted by [[Arnaldo Pomodoro]]. Designed as a ship's prow, the tomb is located at the main entrance to the Cemetery of [[Rimini]]. The [[Federico Fellini Airport]] in [[Rimini]] is named in his honour.

==Political views==
Despite various famous Italian actors favouring the [[Italian Communist Party|Communists]], Fellini, who was not [[left-wing]], supported [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] (DC),<ref>{{cita news|lang= Italian|url=http://www.secoloditalia.it/2013/10/il-fellini-che-non-vi-raccontano-votava-dc-rifiutava-il-cinema-impegnato-ed-era-contro-il-68/|title=Il Fellini che non vi raccontano: votava Dc, rifiutava il cinema impegnato ed era contro il ’68|author=Franco Bianchini|journal=Secolo d'Italia|date= October 31, 2013}}</ref> opposed the [[Protests of 1968|'68 Movement]], and befriended [[Giulio Andreotti]].<ref>{{cita news|lang= Italian|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2012/03/28/cultura/caro-andreotti-caro-fellinil-amicizia-tra-due-arcitaliani-7bjQzwOIzU5hhkHzZABW5J/pagina.html|title=Caro Andreotti, caro Fellini l'amicizia tra due arcitaliani|author=Jacopo Iacoboni|journal=La Stampa|date= March 28, 2012}}</ref> Apart from satirizing [[Silvio Berlusconi]] and mainstream television in ''[[Ginger and Fred]]'',<ref>Kezich, 367</ref> Fellini rarely expressed his political views in public and never directed a [[political film]]. He also directed two electoral television spots during the 1990s: one for DC and another for the Italian Republican Party or [[Italian Republican Party|PRI]].<ref>{{cita news|lang= Italian|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1992/marzo/18/con_PRI_Federico_Fellini_sponsor_co_0_92031817413.shtml|title=Con DC e PRI, Federico Fellini sponsor di due nemicicon DC e PRI, Federico Fellini sponsor di due nemici|author=Unknown|journal=il Corriere della Sera|date= March 18, 1992}}</ref>

Personal and highly idiosyncratic visions of society, Fellini's films are a unique combination of memory, dreams, fantasy and desire. The adjectives "Fellinian" and "Felliniesque" are "synonymous with any kind of extravagant, fanciful, even baroque image in the cinema and in art in general".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> ''La Dolce Vita'' contributed the term ''[[paparazzi]]'' to the English language, derived from Paparazzo, the photographer friend of journalist Marcello Rubini ([[Marcello Mastroianni]]).<ref>Ennio Flaiano, the film's co-screenwriter and creator of Paparazzo, explained that he took the name from Signor Paparazzo, a character in [[George Gissing]]'s novel ''By the Ionian Sea'' (1901).

Polish director, [[Wojciech Has]], whose two major films, ''[[The Saragossa Manuscript (film)|The Saragossa Manuscript]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Hour-Glass Sanatorium]]'' (1973) are examples of [[modernist]] fantasies, has been compared to Fellini for the sheer "luxuriance of his images".<ref>Gilbert Guez, review of ''The Saragossa Manuscript'' in ''[[Le Figaro]]'' (September, 1966), 23</ref>

''I Vitelloni'' inspired European directors [[Juan Antonio Bardem]], [[Marco Ferreri]], and [[Lina Wertmüller]] and had an influence on [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Mean Streets]]'' (1973), [[George Lucas]]'s ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (1974), [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985), and [[Barry Levinson]]'s ''[[Diner]]'' (1987), among many others.<ref>Kezich, 137</ref> When the American magazine ''Cinema'' asked [[Stanley Kubrick]] in 1963 to name his favorite films, the film director listed ''I Vitelloni'' as number one in his Top 10 list.<ref>Ciment, Michel.
