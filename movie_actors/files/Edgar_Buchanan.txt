Among the many [[television series]] in which he was cast as a guest star were ''[[Hopalong Cassidy]],'' ''[[Cimarron City (TV series)|Cimarron City]]'', ''[[The Californians (TV series)|The Californians]]'', ''[[The Rifleman]]'', the episode "[[Duel at Sundown (Maverick)|Duel at Sundown]]" of ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' with [[James Garner]] and [[Clint Eastwood]], ''[[Leave It To Beaver]]'' (as both "Uncle Billy" and "Captain Jack"), ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'' (as Wingate Pardee in the 1960 episode, "Duel on the River"), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', [[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]], ''[[Bringing Up Buddy]]'', ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'', ''[[The Lloyd Bridges Show]]'', and ''[[Cade's County]]''.

Only loosely based on the career of the legendary storekeeper, bartender, and [[Justice of the Peace]] [[Roy Bean]], the series had supporting roles for [[Jack Buetel]], [[Jackie Loughery]], and [[Russell Hayden]], he as a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]].

Buchanan appeared in all 222 episodes of ''Petticoat Junction'', the only actor from the show to do so, as well as in 17 episodes of ''Green Acres'', and three episodes of ''The Beverly Hillbillies'', in each as the crusty character,  Uncle Joe Carson. From 1960 to 1962, he appeared four times on the [[NBC]] western series ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'', with [[John Smith (actor)|John Smith]] and [[Robert Fuller (actor)|Robert Fuller]].  Buchanan made two guest appearances on ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'': in 1958 as a small-town coroner in "The Case of the Perjured Parrot," and in 1962 as a small-town judge in "The Case of the Lurid Letter."

Buchanan and another star from ''Petticoat Junction'' appeared together in the movie ''[[Benji]]''; the other "star" was  [[Higgins (dog)|Higgins]], the unnamed "dog" from the sitcom, who portrayed the title role in the film. Higgins had been found in an animal shelter and trained by [[Frank Inn]], who also trained [[Arnold Ziffel]] (the pig) and the other animals used on ''The Beverly Hillbillies,'' ''Petticoat Junction,'' and ''Green Acres''.

===Death===
Buchanan died from a [[stroke]] complicated by [[pneumonia]] in [[Palm Desert, California]], and was interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]].
