'''Dayle Lymoine Robertson''' (July 14, 1923{{spaced ndash}}February 27, 2013) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]] best known for his starring roles on [[television]]. He played the roving investigator Jim Hardie in the [[NBC]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television series]] ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'', and Ben Calhoun, the owner of an incomplete railroad line in ABC's ''[[The Iron Horse (TV series)|The Iron Horse]]''. He was often presented as a deceptively thoughtful but modest [[Western (genre)|western]] hero. From 1968 to 1970, Robertson was the fourth and final host of  the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] ''[[Death Valley Days]]'' [[anthology series]].

==Early life==
Born in 1923 to Melvin and Vervel Robertson in [[Harrah, Oklahoma|Harrah]] in [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma County]] near [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]] in central [[Oklahoma]], Robertson fought as a professional [[boxing|boxer]] whilst enrolled in the [[Oklahoma Military Academy]] in [[Claremore, Oklahoma|Claremore]].<ref name="drob"/> During this time Columbia Pictures offered Robertson the lead in their film version of ''[[Golden Boy (film)|Golden Boy]]'' but Robertson turned down the trip to Hollywood for a [[screen test]] as he didn't want to leave the ponies he was training or his home.<ref>http://www.oklahomaheritage.com/Portals/0/PDF's/HOF%20bios/Robertson,%20Dale%20L..pdf</ref>

During World War II he was commissioned through [[Officer Candidate School]], and served in the [[United States Army]] 322nd [[Combat engineer|Combat Engineer Battalion]] of the [[97th Infantry Division]] in Europe.  He was wounded twice and was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze]] and [[Silver Star]] medals.<ref>http://www.chuckhawks.com/combat_vet.htm</ref>

==Career==
Robertson began his acting career by chance when he was in the [[United States Army]]. Stationed at [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]], [[California]], Robertson decided to have a [[photograph]] taken for his mother; so he and several other [[soldier]]s went to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to find a photographer. A large copy of his photo was later displayed in the photographer's shop window.<ref name="drob">Paregien Sr., Stan, [http://www.fortunecity.com/roswell/bailey/16/dalerob-01.html Dale Robertson profile at www.fortunecity.com] (accessed May 26, 2010)</ref> He found himself receiving letters from film agents who wished to represent him. After the war, Robertson's war wounds prevented him from resuming his boxing career.  He stayed in California to try his hand at acting. Hollywood actor [[Will Rogers, Jr.]], gave him this advice: "Don't ever take a dramatic lesson. They will try to put your voice in a dinner jacket, and people like their hominy and grits in everyday clothes." Robertson thereafter avoided formal acting lessons.<ref name="drob"/>

Robertson made his film debut in an uncredited role as a policeman in ''[[The Boy with Green Hair]]'' (1948).  Two other uncredited appearances led to featured roles in two [[Nat Holt]] Westerns ''[[Fighting Man of the Plains]]'' where he played [[Jesse James]] and  ''[[The Cariboo Trail]]''. Popular acclaim to Robertson's brief roles led him to be signed to a seven year contract to [[20th Century Fox]].  He soon advanced to leading roles in films such as ''[[Take Care of My Little Girl]]'', ''[[Golden Girl (1951 film)|Golden Girl]]'' (1951) and ''[[Lydia Bailey]]''.<ref name="theguardian.com">http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/28/dale-robertson</ref>

Robertson was never very co-operative with the press, even shunning the powerful columnist [[Louella Parsons]].<ref>Marshall, Peter ''Backstage with the Original Hollywood Square''
Thomas Nelson Inc, 17 Jul 2002</ref> As a result, he won the press [[Sour Apple Award]] for three years running. But then, commented Robertson, "that dang Sinatra had to hit some photographer in the nose and stop me from getting my fourth".<ref name="theguardian.com"/>

For most of his career, Robertson played in western films and television showsâ€”well over sixty titles in all. His best-remembered series, ''Tales of Wells Fargo'', aired on NBC from 1957 to 1961, when it moved to ABC and expanded to an hour-long program for its final season in 1961-1962. The show was originally produced by Nat Holt who Robertson felt he owed his career to for giving him his first leading roles.<ref>http://www.westernclippings.com/remember/talesofwellsfargo_doyouremember.shtml</ref> Robertson also did the narration for ''Tales of Wells Fargo'' through which he often presented his own commentary on matters of law, morality, and common sense. In its March 30, 1959, cover story on television westerns, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [[magazine]] reported Robertson was 6 feet tall, weighed 180 pounds, and measured 42-34-34. He sometimes made use of his physique in "beefcake" scenes, such as one in 1952's ''[[Return of the Texan]]'' where he is seen bare-chested and sweaty, repairing a fence.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', March 30, 1959, cover story</ref>

In 1960, Robertson guest starred as himself in NBC's ''[[The Ford Show]]'', starring [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ernieford.com/TEFTVGuests.htm|title=''The Ford Show'' Guest Star Guide|publisher=ernieford.com|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref> In 1962, he similarly appeared on a short-lived western comedy and variety series, ABC's ''[[The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show]]''.<ref>[http://www.moviesunlimited.com/musite/product.asp?sku=D64143 The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show], [http://www.moviesunlimited.com/ Movies Unlimited] (accessed May 26, 2010)</ref> In 1963, after ''Tales of Wells Fargo'' ended its five-year run, he played the lead role in the first of [[A.C. Lyles]]' [[second feature]] westerns, ''[[Law of the Lawless (1963 film)|Law of the Lawless]]''. [[File:Dale Robertson 1959.JPG|thumb|Dale Robertson 1959]]

Robertson created United Screen Arts in 1965<ref>p.34 ''Billboard'' 21 Aug 1965</ref> which released two of his films, ''[[The Man from Button Willow]]'' (1965, animated) and ''[[The One Eyed Soldiers]]'' (1966). Robertson filmed a [[television pilot]] about [[Diamond Jim Brady]] that was not picked up as a series.

In the 1966-67 season, Robertson starred in ''[[Scalplock]]'' another television pilot released as a movie that became ABC's ''[[The Iron Horse (TV series)|The Iron Horse]]'', in which his character wins an incomplete railroad line in a [[poker]] game and then decides to manage the company.<ref name="drob"/> In 1968, he succeeded [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] as the host of ''Death Valley Days'', a role formerly held by [[Stanley Andrews]] and future [[U.S. President]] [[Ronald W. Reagan]]. In rebroadcasts, ''Death Valley Days'' is often known as ''Trails West'', with [[Ray Milland]] in the role of revised host. Though Robertson played a central part in two episodes of [[CBS]]'s ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' series with [[Angela Lansbury]], he was not credited in either appearance.

He portrayed legendary FBI agent [[Melvin Purvis]] in two made-for-television movies, ''[[Melvin Purvis: G-Man]]'' (1974) and ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073225/ The Kansas City Massacre]'' (1975).

In 1981, Robertson was in the original starring cast of ABC's popular night-time [[soap opera]], ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]'', playing [[Walter Lankershim]], a character who disappeared after the first season. In 1985, it was revealed in the story line that the character had died off screen.

In 1983 Robertson made another television pilot ''Big John'' where he played a Georgia Sheriff who becomes a New York Police Department detective.<ref>p.30 Terrace, Vincent ''Encyclopedia of Television Pilots, 1937-2012'' McFarland, 26 Feb 2013</ref>  In 1987, he starred as the title character on the NBC [[crime drama]], ''[[J.J. Starbuck]]''. Robertson also appeared in the TV series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', during the 1982 season. His character was Frank Crutcher, who appeared in about a half dozen episodes. In December 1993 and January 1994, Robertson appeared in two episodes of the CBS comedy/western ''[[Harts of the West]]'' in the role of "Zeke Terrell", the brother of series co-star [[Lloyd Bridges]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106022/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm#cast Full cast and crew of ''Harts of the West''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]</ref> During an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', Robertson said he was of [[Cherokee]] ancestry. He joked, "I&nbsp;am the tribe's West Coast distributor."

He received the [[Golden Boot Awards|Golden Boot Award]] in 1985, has a star on the [[List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame|Hollywood Walk of Fame]], and is also in the [[Hall of Great Western Performers]] and the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in Oklahoma City.

In 1999, Robertson won the award for film and television from the [[American Cowboy Culture Association]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/091099/loc_0910990117.shtml|title=Teresa Cox Young, Cowboy life rides high at awards show: Symposium saddles up with tribute to heritage, September 10, 1999|publisher=''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]''|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref>

==Quotes==
''â€œUpon our first meeting Henry Hathaway walked up and warned me that he might scream and holler at his actors but that it was all for the good of the movie and that he truly meant nothing by it. I told him that I had a hard fast rule that any director that berated me in front of the cast would have his teeth knocked out. We became friends after that.''<br><ref>http://www.thedigitalbits.com/columns/view-from-the-cheap-seats/dale-robertson-rip</ref><ref>p.82 Roberts, Jerry ''Mitchum: In His Own Words'' Limelight Editions, 2000</ref>
