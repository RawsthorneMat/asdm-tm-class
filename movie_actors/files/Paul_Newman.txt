Newman showed an early interest in the theater; his first role was at the age of seven, playing the court jester in a school production of ''[[Robin Hood]]''. At age 10, Newman performed at the [[Cleveland Play House]] in a production of ''[[St. George and the Dragon|Saint George and the Dragon]]'', and was a notable actor and alum of their Curtain Pullers children's theatre program.<ref name="Cleveland Memory">{{cite web|title=Paul Newman at The Cleveland Play House Children's Theatre|url=http://images.ulib.csuohio.edu/cdm/ref/collection/press/id/5556|website=The Cleveland Memory Project|accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref> Graduating from [[Shaker Heights High School]] in 1943, he briefly attended [[Ohio University]] in [[Athens, Ohio]], where he was initiated into the [[Phi Kappa Tau]] fraternity.<ref name="tiscali"/>

===Military service===
Newman served in the [[United States Navy]] in [[World War II]] in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific theater]].<ref name="tiscali"/> Initially, he enrolled in the Navy [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12]] pilot training program at [[Yale University]], but was dropped when his colorblindness was discovered.<ref name="tiscali"/><ref name="navy">[http://www.history.navy.mil/bios/newman_p.htm ''Paul Newman''].

He was subsequently assigned to Pacific-based replacement torpedo squadrons VT-98, VT-99, and VT-100, responsible primarily for training replacement combat pilots and air crewmen, with special emphasis on carrier landings.<ref name="navy"/>

Newman later flew as a turret gunner in an [[TBF Avenger|Avenger]] torpedo bomber. As a radioman-gunner, he was ordered aboard the {{USS|Bunker Hill|CV-17|6}} with a draft of replacements shortly before the [[Battle of Okinawa]] in the spring of 1945. An ear infection grounded his pilot, leaving the pair the detail's sole survivors when the rest of their unit was wiped out in action during the campaign.<ref>[[Max Hastings|Hastings, Max]] (2008).

==Career==

===Early work and mainstream success===
[[File:Paul Newman 1954.JPG|thumb|upright|In his first film, ''The Silver Chalice'' (1954)]]
Newman arrived in New York City in 1951 with his first wife Jackie Witte, taking up residence in the [[St. George, Staten Island|St. George]] section of [[Staten Island]].<ref>[http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/actor_paul_newmans_dramatic_ro.html Actor Paul Newman's dramatic roots were sprouted on Staten Island]</ref><ref>{{Wayback |date=20090213101046 |url=http://forgotten-ny.com/NEIGHBORHOODS/cynthiatour/st.george.html |title=Forgotten-NY Neighborhoods: St. George: Staten Island's Wonderland }}</ref> He made his [[Broadway theater]] debut in the original production of [[William Inge]]'s ''[[Picnic (play)|Picnic]]'' with [[Kim Stanley]] in 1953 and appeared in the original Broadway production of ''[[The Desperate Hours (play)|The Desperate Hours]]'' in 1955. In 1959, he was in the original Broadway production of ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' with [[Geraldine Page]] and three years later starred with Page in the film version.

During this time Newman started acting in television. His first credited role was in a 1952 episode of ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'' entitled "Ice from Space".<ref>{{cite episode|title=Ice From Space|series=Tales of Tomorrow|serieslink=Tales of Tomorrow |airdate=August 8, 1952|season=1|number=43}}</ref> In the mid-1950s, he appeared twice on [[CBS]]'s ''[[Appointment with Adventure]]'' [[anthology series]].

In February 1954, Newman appeared in a screen test with [[James Dean]], directed by [[Gjon Mili]], for ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'' (1955). Newman was tested for the role of Aron Trask, Dean for the role of Aron's fraternal twin brother Cal. Dean won his part, but Newman lost out to [[Richard Davalos]]. That same year, Newman co-starred with [[Eva Marie Saint]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] in a live—and color—television broadcast of ''[[Our Town (television)|Our Town]]'', a musical adaptation of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s stage play. Newman was a last-minute replacement for James Dean.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Weiner|first=Ed|last2=Editors of TV Guide|title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History|place=New York|publisher=Harper Collins |year=1992|edition=First|page=118}}</ref> The "James Dean" connection had resonance two other times, as Newman was cast in two leading roles originally earmarked for Dean, Billy the Kid in ''[[The Left Handed Gun]]'' and [[Rocky Graziano]] in ''[[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]]'', after Dean succumbed to his fateful automobile collision up the California coast.

Newman's first movie for Hollywood was ''[[The Silver Chalice (film)|The Silver Chalice]]'' (1954). The film was a box office failure and the actor would later acknowledge his disdain for it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKRWD9ec_Eo|title=Inside The Actors Studio – Paul Newman|publisher=YouTube|date=June 8, 2011|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref> In 1956, Newman garnered much attention and acclaim for the role of Rocky Graziano in ''[[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]]''. By 1958, he was one of the hottest new stars in Hollywood. Later that year, he starred in ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (film)|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1958), opposite [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. The film was a box office smash and Newman garnered his first [[Academy Award]] nomination. Also in 1958, Newman starred in ''[[The Long, Hot Summer]]'' with [[Joanne Woodward]], with whom he reconnected on the set in 1957 (they had first met in 1953). He won best actor at the [[1958 Cannes Film Festival]] for this film.

===Major films===
Newman starred in ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'' (1960), ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'' (1961), ''[[Hud (film)|Hud]]'' (1963), ''[[Harper (film)|Harper]]'' (1966), ''[[Hombre (film)|Hombre]]'' (1967), ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'' (1967), ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974), ''[[Slap Shot (film)|Slap Shot]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Verdict]]'' (1982). He teamed with fellow actor [[Robert Redford]] and director [[George Roy Hill]] for ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969) and ''[[The Sting]]'' (1973).

He appeared with his wife, [[Joanne Woodward]], in the feature films ''[[The Long, Hot Summer]]'' (1958), ''[[Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!]]'', (1958), ''[[From the Terrace]]'' (1960), ''[[Paris Blues]]'' (1961), ''[[A New Kind of Love]]'' (1963),  ''[[Winning]]'' (1969), ''[[WUSA (film)|WUSA]]'' (1970), ''[[The Drowning Pool (film)|The Drowning Pool]]'' (1975), ''[[Harry & Son]]'' (1984), and ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Bridge]]'' (1990). They both also starred in the [[HBO]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Empire Falls (miniseries)|Empire Falls]]'', but did not have any scenes together.
[[File:Paul Newman Cannes 1987.jpg|thumb|upright|Paul Newman at the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival]]]]

In addition to starring in and directing ''Harry & Son'', Newman also directed four feature films  starring Woodward. They were ''[[Rachel, Rachel]]'' (1968), based on [[Margaret Laurence]]'s ''A Jest of God'', the screen version of the [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning play ''[[The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds]]'' (1972), the television screen version of the Pulitzer Prize–winning play ''[[The Shadow Box]]'' (1980), and a screen version of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[The Glass Menagerie (1987 film)|The Glass Menagerie]]'' (1987).

Twenty-five years after ''The Hustler'', Newman reprised his role of "Fast" Eddie Felson in the [[Martin Scorsese]]–directed film ''[[The Color of Money]]'' (1986), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor.

===21st century roles===
In 2003, Newman appeared in a Broadway revival of Wilder's ''[[Our Town]]'', receiving his first [[Tony Award]] nomination for his performance. [[PBS]] and the cable network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] aired a taping of the production, and Newman was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/paul-newman|title=Paul Newman|work=Television Academy}}</ref> for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie.

Newman's last screen appearance was as a conflicted mob boss in the 2002 film ''[[Road to Perdition]]'' opposite [[Tom Hanks]], for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, although he continued to provide voice work for films. In 2006, in keeping with his strong interest in car racing, he provided the voice of [[Doc Hudson]], a retired anthropomorphic race car in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]]'s ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''—this was his final role for a major feature film.

Newman retired from acting in May 2007, saying "You start to lose your memory, you start to lose your confidence, you start to lose your invention. So I think that's pretty much a closed book for me."<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,21797406-2,00.html ''Paul Newman quits films after stellar career'']. News.com.au. May 27, 2007. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6695939.stm ''Hollywood star Newman to retire'']. BBC News. May 27, 2007.</ref>

He came out of retirement to record narration for two more films, however: the 2007 documentary ''[[Dale (film)|Dale]]'', about the life of [[NASCAR]] driver [[Dale Earnhardt]], and the 2008 documentary ''[[The Meerkats]]''.

==Philanthropy==
[[File:Paul Newman in Carnation, Washington June 2007 cropped.jpg|thumb|Newman in 2007]]
With writer [[A. E. Hotchner]], Newman founded [[Newman's Own]], a line of food products, in 1982. The brand started with salad dressing, and has expanded to include pasta sauce, lemonade, popcorn, salsa, and wine, among other things. Newman established a policy that all proceeds, after taxes, would be donated to charity. {{As of|2014}}, the franchise has donated in excess of $400 million.<ref name="faq"/> He co-wrote a [[memoir]] about the subject with Hotchner, ''Shameless Exploitation in Pursuit of the Common Good''. Among other awards, Newman's Own co-sponsors the [[PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award]], a $25,000 reward designed to recognize those who protect the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as it applies to the written word.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24149703-663,00.html "Paul Newman says he will die at home"].{{Dead link|date=September 2010}} ''[[Herald Sun]]''. August 9, 2008.</ref>

One beneficiary of his philanthropy is the [[Hole in the Wall Gang Camp]], a residential summer camp for seriously ill children, which is located in [[Ashford, Connecticut]]. Newman co-founded the camp in 1988; it was named after the gang in his film ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' (1969). Newman's college fraternity, [[Phi Kappa Tau]], adopted Hole in the Wall as their "national philanthropy" in 1995. One camp has expanded to become several Hole in the Wall Camps in the U.S., Ireland, France, and Israel. The camps serve 13,000 children every year, free of charge.<ref name="faq"/>

In June 1999, Newman donated $250,000 to [[Catholic Relief Services]] to aid refugees in [[Kosovo]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Paul Newman Philanthropy|url=http://www.facesofphilanthropy.com/paul-newman/|date=November 14, 2011|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref>

On June 1, 2007, [[Kenyon College]] announced that Newman had donated $10 million to the school to establish a scholarship fund as part of the college's current $230 million fund-raising campaign. Newman and Woodward were honorary co-chairs of a previous campaign.<ref name="Reuters-Kenyon">{{Cite news|title=Paul Newman donates $10 mln to Kenyon College|publisher=Reuters|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0238991920070602|date=June 2, 2007|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}</ref>

Newman was one of the founders of the [[Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy]] (CECP), a membership organization of CEOs and corporate chairpersons committed to raising the level and quality of global corporate philanthropy. Founded in 1999 by Newman and a few leading CEOs, CECP has grown to include more than 175 members and, through annual executive convenings, extensive benchmarking research, and best practice publications, leads the business community in developing sustainable and strategic community partnerships through philanthropy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatephilanthropy.org|title=CECP – Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy|publisher=Corporatephilanthropy.org|accessdate=March 10, 2010}}</ref>
Newman was named the Most Generous Celebrity of 2008 by Givingback.org. He contributed $20,857,000 for the year of 2008 to the Newman's Own Foundation, which distributes funds to a variety of charities.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Giving Back 30|url=http://www.givingback.org/Programs_Services/GivingBack30_2008.html|publisher=The Giving Back Fund|date=November 1, 2009|accessdate=November 4, 2009}}</ref>

Upon Newman's death, the Italian newspaper (a "semi-official" paper of the [[Holy See]]) ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' published a notice lauding Newman's philanthropy. It also commented that "Newman was a generous heart, an actor of a dignity and style rare in Hollywood quarters."<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[Catholic News Service]]|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0804957.htm|title=Catholic film critics laud actor Paul Newman's career, generosity|first=Mark|last=Pattison|date=September 30, 2008|accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref>

Newman met actress [[Joanne Woodward]] in 1953. Shortly after filming ''The Long, Hot Summer'' in 1957, he divorced Witte. He married Woodward early in 1958. They remained married for fifty years until his death in 2008.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/package/gallery/0,,20229386_20219605_3,00.html "Remembering Paul Newman."] ''People''.

Newman was also an ordained minister of the [[Universal Life Church Monastery]], a one-day online certificate program to officiate weddings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themonastery.org/|title=Universal Life Church - Official Site - Est. 1977|work=Universal Life Church Monastery}}</ref>

==Political activism==
[[File:Paul newman menomonee falls wisconsin mcarthy eugene rally.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Newman at a political rally for [[Eugene McCarthy]] in 1968]]
Newman was a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. For his support of [[Eugene McCarthy]] in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]] (and effective use of television commercials in California) and his opposition to the [[War in Vietnam]], Newman was placed nineteenth on [[Nixon's Enemies List|Richard Nixon's enemies list]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~polisci/calvert/PolSci3103/watergate/enemy.htm|title=List of White House 'Enemies' and Memo Submitted by Dean to the Ervin Committee|publisher=Facts on File|accessdate=March 10, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030621235432/www.artsci.wustl.edu/~polisci/calvert/PolSci3103/watergate/enemy.htm|archivedate=June 21, 2003}}</ref> which Newman claimed was his greatest accomplishment. During the 1968 general election, Newman supported Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey and appeared in a pre-election night telethon for him.

Consistent with his work for [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] causes, Newman publicly supported [[Ned Lamont]]'s candidacy in the 2006 Connecticut Democratic Primary against Senator [[Joe Lieberman]], and was even rumored as a candidate himself, until Lamont emerged as a credible alternative. He donated to [[Christopher Dodd|Chris Dodd]]'s presidential campaign.<ref>[http://www.wfsb.com/politics/12281464/detail.html?rss=hart&psp=news ''Dodd Gets Financial Boost From Celebs'']{{dead link|date=June 2012}}.

He attended the first [[Earth Day]] event in [[Manhattan]] on April 22, 1970.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/09/28/MN8R1194R6.DTL|title=Paul Newman an icon of cool masculinity|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=September 28, 2008|accessdate=March 10, 2010|first=Steven|last=Winn}}</ref>

==Auto racing==
[[File:Paul Newman Racing 1979 Spyder NF-11 Chevrolet V8 - CanAm single seater racer based on Lola T333CS.jpg|thumb|right|A Newman Freeman Racing NF Spyder Can-Am race car]]
Newman was an auto racing enthusiast, and first became interested in motorsports ("the first thing that I ever found I had any grace in") while training at the [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen Racing School]] for the filming of ''[[Winning]]'', a 1969 film. Because of his love and passion for racing, Newman agreed in 1971 to star in and to host his first television special, ''[[Once Upon a Wheel]],'' on the history of auto racing. It was produced and directed by David Winters, who co-owned a number of racing cars with Newman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidwinters.net/onceuponawheel.htm|title=Once Upon A Wheel|publisher=Davidwinters.net|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidwinters.net/archives.htm|title=David Winters Tribute Site|publisher=Davidwinters.net|date=April 1, 2003|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref> Newman's first professional event as a racer was in 1972, at [[Thompson International Speedway]], and he was a frequent competitor in [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) events for the rest of the decade, eventually winning four national championships. He later drove in the [[1979 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in Dick Barbour's [[Porsche 935]] and finished in second place.<ref name="1979 Le Mans">{{cite web|url=http://www.formula2.net/1979.htm|title=XLVII Grand Prix d'Endurance les 24 Heures du Mans 1979|publisher=Le Mans & F2 Register|date=May 2, 2008|accessdate=September 27, 2008}}</ref> Newman reunited with Barbour in 2000 to compete in the [[2000 Petit Le Mans|Petit Le Mans]].<ref name="Petit">{{cite web|url=http://wsrp.ic.cz/alms2000.html#9|title=American Le Mans Series 2000|publisher=World Sports Racing Prototypes|date=October 2, 2005|accessdate=September 27, 2008}}</ref>

From the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, he drove for the Bob Sharp Racing team, racing mainly [[Datsun]]s (later rebranded as [[Nissan Motors|Nissans]]) in the [[Trans-Am Series]]. He became closely associated with the brand during the 1980s, even appearing in commercials for them. At the age of 70 years and eight days, he became the oldest driver to be part of a winning team in a major sanctioned race,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vaughn|first=Mark|title=Paul Newman 1925–2008|journal=[[AutoWeek]]|volume=58|issue=40|page=43|date=October 6, 2008|year=}}</ref> winning in his class at the 1995 [[24 Hours of Daytona]].<ref name="1995 Daytona">{{cite web|url=http://wsrp.ic.cz/imsa1995.html#1|title=International Motor Sports Association 1995|publisher=World Sports Racing Prototypes|date=February 14, 2007|accessdate=September 27, 2008}}</ref> Among his last races were the [[Baja 1000]] in 2004 and the 24 Hours of Daytona once again in 2005.<ref name="2005 Daytona">{{cite web|url=http://wsrp.ic.cz/grandam2005.html#1|title=Grand-American Road Racing Championship 2005|publisher=World Sports Racing Prototypes|date=December 17, 2005|accessdate=September 27, 2008}}</ref>

During the 1976 auto racing season, Paul Newman became interested in forming a professional auto racing team and contacted [[Bill Freeman (racing driver)|Bill Freeman]] from Santa Barbara. Bill is credited as the man who introduced Paul Newman to professional auto racing management, and their company specialized in Can-Am, Indy Cars, and other high performance racing automobiles. The team was based in [[Santa Barbara, California]] and commuted to [[Willow Springs International Motorsports Park]] for much of its testing sessions.

Their "Newman Freeman Racing" team was very competitive in the North American Can-Am series in their Budweiser sponsored Chevrolet powered [[Spyder NF-10|Spyder NF]]s. Paul and Bill began a long and successful partnership with the Newman Freeman Racing team in the Can-Am series which culminated in the Can-Am Team Championship trophy in 1979. Their drivers included Keke Rosberg (who later became World Champion on the Williams Saudia F1 Team), Elliott Forbes-Robinson, Randolph Townsend, Mike Brockman, Howdy Holmes, Teo Fabi, Patrick Depailler, Danny Sullivan, Bobby Rahal, Johnny Parson Jr., among others.

Paul was also associated with Bill Freeman's established Porsche racing team which allowed both Paul and Bill to compete in S.C.C.A. and I.M.S.A. racing events together, including the Sebring 12-hour endurance sports car race. This car was sponsored by Beverly Porsche/Audi. Bill Freeman was also Sports Car Club of America's Southern Pacific National Champion during the Newman Freeman Racing period.

Later Newman co-founded [[Newman/Haas/Lanigan Racing|Newman/Haas Racing]] with [[Carl Haas]], a [[Champ Car]] team, in 1983, going on to win 8 drivers' championships under his ownership. The 1996 racing season was chronicled in the [[IMAX]] film ''[[Super Speedway]]'', which Newman narrated. He was also a partner in the [[Atlantic Championship]] team [[Newman Wachs Racing]].

Newman was posthumously inducted into the [[SCCA Hall of Fame]] at the national convention in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]] on February 21, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scca.org/newsarticle.aspx?hub=6&news=3533|title=Newman Leads List of New SCCA Hall of Fame Inductees|publisher=Sports Car Club of America|date=December 3, 2008|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref>

{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
Newman is one of four actors to have been nominated for an academy award in five different decades.  The other nominees were Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, and Jack Nicholson.

In addition to the awards Newman won for specific roles, he received an honorary Academy Award in 1986 for his "many and memorable and compelling screen performances" and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for his charity work in 1994.

He received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1992 along with his wife, Joanne Woodward.

In 1994, Newman and his wife received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by&nbsp;[[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national|title=National - Jefferson Awards|work=Jefferson Awards}}</ref>

Newman won [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[The Long, Hot Summer]]'' and the Silver Bear at the [[Berlin Film Festival]] for ''[[Nobody's Fool (1994 film)|Nobody's Fool]]''.

In 1968,{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Newman was named "Man of the Year" by [[Harvard University]]'s performance group, the [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals]].

[[Newman Day]] has been celebrated at [[Kenyon College]], [[Bates College]], [[Princeton University]], and other American colleges since the 1970s. In 2004, Newman requested that Princeton University disassociate the event from his name, due to the fact that he did not endorse the behaviors, citing his creation of the Scott Newman Centre in 1980, which is "dedicated to the prevention of substance abuse through education".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Binge drink ritual upsets actor|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3652179.stm |publisher=BBC News|date=April 24, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Cheng|title=Newman's Day – forget it, star urges drinkers|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/23/1082616331695.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=April 24, 2004}}</ref>
