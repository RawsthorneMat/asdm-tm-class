'''Jack Perrin''' (July 25, 1896 &ndash; December 17, 1967) was an American [[actor]] specializing in [[Western (genre)#Film|Westerns]].

==Biography==
He was born '''Lyman Wakefield Perrin''' in [[Three Rivers, Michigan]]; his father worked in real estate and relocated the family to [[Los Angeles, California]] shortly after the start of the 20th century.

Perrin served in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]]. Following the war, he returned to Los Angeles and started acting for [[Universal Studios]]. His first on-screen appearance was in the 1917 film ''[[Luke's Lost Liberty]]'' alongside [[Harold Lloyd]].

Perrin married [[silent film]] actress [[Josephine Hill]] in 1920. During the 1920s, Perrin made a name for himself, starring in a number of [[cliffhanger]], [[melodrama]], and [[Serial (film)|serial]] films. 

Perrin found a niche in [[B-movie]] Westerns of the 1930s. He usually played leads as Jack Perrin, but occasionally adopted the pseudonyms Jack Gable or Richard (Dick) Terry. <!-- speculation needs ref Perrin was then co-producing low-budget films with Hollywood veteran William Berke, and the pseudonyms may have been intended to mislead exhibitors as to the depth of the Berke-Perrin company's talent pool.-->

Perrin's last major role was as [[Davy Crockett]] in 1937's ''[[The Painted Stallion]]'', for [[Republic Pictures]]. Perrin divorced his wife that year as well. Though he continued making films through 1960, many of his later roles were minor and often went uncredited. 

Perrin suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and died December 17, 1967, aged 71.

For his contributions as an actor in motion pictures, Jack Perrin was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1777 Vine Street, in [[Hollywood, California]].
