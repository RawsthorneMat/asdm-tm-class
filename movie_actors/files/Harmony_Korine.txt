==Film career==

===''Kids'' and ''Gummo'' (1995–1998)===
Korine was skating with friends in [[Washington Square Park]] when he noticed photographer [[Larry Clark]].<ref name="VV95">Taubin, Amy. 1995. "[http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/skating.html Skating The Edge With Kids]." [[Village Voice]]. Retrieved 2009-10-29.</ref> Impressed, the photographer asked him to compose a script about skaters and to include in the plot a teenage AIDS experience.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=2:231470~T1 allmovie ((( Harmony Korine > Biography )))<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Korine told Clark, "I've been waiting all my life to write this story."<ref>Bowen, Peter. Summer 1995. "[http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/rascals.html The Little Rascals]." Retrieved 2009-10-29.</ref> Within three weeks, Korine wrote ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]'', a film about 24 hours in the sex and drug filled lives of several Manhattan teenagers that has been touted as a realistic viewpoint of youth in New York City during the [[AIDS]] crisis. ''Kids'' garnered mixed reviews, but due to its [[NC-17]] rating, few audiences actually saw the film upon its debut. However, it has since become a significant [[cult film]]. Among others, the film features [[Chloë Sevigny]] and [[Rosario Dawson]] in their first movie roles. The film, while controversial, jumpstarted Korine's career. This put him into contact with film producer [[Cary Woods]] who budgeted about $1 million to produce ''[[Gummo]]'', Korine's personal vision.<ref name="VV95"/>

In 1997, Korine wrote and directed ''Gummo'', a film based on life in [[Xenia, Ohio]], a town devastated by [[Super Outbreak#Xenia, Ohio|a tornado]] in the early 1970s. Forgoing conventional narrative, ''Gummo'' embodies sketches written by Korine, hence the nonlinear, fragmented events over the course of the film capitalizing on the obscure. Much of the cast was found during preproduction where it was filmed in Tennessee, and of all those who appeared in the film, only five were experienced actors. The film is notable for having unsettling, often bizarre scenes, as well as its dreamlike soundtrack, which strengthens the disconcerting atmosphere. It features "an eclectic soundtrack including [[death metal]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Roy Orbison]].<ref>http://ablogforblackpaul.blogspot.com/</ref>

It premiered at the 24th [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 29, 1997. During the screening, numerous people got up and left during the initial cat drowning sequence. Three months later, [[Werner Herzog]] called Korine to give praise to the film overall, especially the bacon taped to the wall during the bathtub scene. He told ''The New York Times'', "When I saw a piece of fried bacon fixed to the bathroom wall in ''Gummo'', it knocked me off my chair. [Korine's] a very clear voice of a generation of filmmakers that is taking a new position. It's not going to dominate world cinema, but so what?"<ref name="herzog">{{Cite web|url=http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/main/c_gummo.html|title=Harmony-Korine.com – News|accessdate=2007-03-22|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061108044347/http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/main/c_gummo.html |archivedate = November 8, 2006}}</ref>

Although a majority of mainstream critics derided it as an unintelligible mess, it won top prizes at that year's [[Venice Film Festival]] and earned Korine the respect of noted filmmakers such as [[Gus Van Sant]], among others. Its stature has only grown in the ensuing years, gaining a cult classic status as a truly shocking and experimental film "unlike anything you've seen in a while – maybe ever" – and that "if you're the kind of person who claims to be frustrated by the predictability of commercial filmmaking, [it presents] a rare opportunity to put your money where your mouth is."<ref name="nypress">{{Cite web|url=http://www.finelinefeatures.com/gummo/review02.html|title=Fine Line Features|accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>

In 1998, Korine released ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank Pt II]]'', a 40-minute three-screen collage featuring a boy burying his dog, kids in [[satanism|satanic]] dress vomiting on a [[Bible]], and a man in black-face dancing and singing "[[My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean]]". It utilizes some of the same actors and themes as ''Gummo'', and can be considered a companion piece as the film utilises footage that didn't make the final cut of ''Gummo''. The film "further disgusted critics"<ref name=autogenerated2 /> and solidified his status as a notoriously shocking and experimental director.

===''Julien Donkey-Boy'' and ''Ken Park'' (1999–2003)===
''[[Julien Donkey-Boy]]'', released in 1999, included a signed [[Dogme 95]] manifesto. While it broke a number of the movement's basic tenets, [[Lars Von Trier]] lauded Korine's ability to interpret the rules creatively.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The story is told from the perspective of a young man suffering from untreated [[schizophrenia]], played by [[Ewen Bremner]], as he tries to understand his deteriorating world. Julien's abusive and arguably hypersensitive father is played by Werner Herzog. At one point, Korine was to play the son, but he backed down and was replaced by Bremner.

Like ''[[Gummo]]'' and ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]'', it too has since become something of a cult classic, a go-to film for those seeking cinema that is, as Roger Ebert said in his three star review, "shocking for most moviegoers", unlike "the slick aboveground indie productions" that are now the norm.<ref name="ebert">{{Cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991105/REVIEWS/911050303/1023|title=Harmony Korine|accessdate=2006-12-27|publisher=rogerebert.com|author=Ebert, Roger|work=Movie Reviews|format=xhtml|date=1999-11-05}}</ref>

In 2000 ''[[The Devil, The Sinner, and His Journey]]'' premiered, which featured Korine in black metal [[corpsepaint]] as [[O.J. Simpson]] and [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Kato Kaelin]].

In 2002, [[Larry Clark]] made ''[[Ken Park]]'', based on a script Korine had written several years earlier. The film, another adult tale of youth gone awry, was not distributed in the United States. At the time of its release, Clark and Korine had long since parted ways, and Korine had no involvement in its production.

In 2003, he made the television documentary ''[[David Blaine#Above the Below|Above the Below]]'' about his friend and collaborator [[David Blaine]] and his 44-day stunt in a park over the bank of [[River Thames]] in London inside a suspended [[acrylic glass|plexiglas]] box. A documentary commissioned by [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky Television]] and [[Channel 4]], it also includes jokes, visual poetry, and music. In addition, Korine has worked with Blaine on a number of Blaine's specials.

He first met his wife, [[Rachel Korine|Rachel (Simon) Korine]], a 17-year-old from [[Nashville]], around this time.

===''Mister Lonely'' and ''Trash Humpers'' (2007–2009)===
His third feature film, ''[[Mister Lonely]]'', was co-written by his brother, Avi Korine and starred [[Diego Luna]], [[Samantha Morton]], [[Denis Lavant]], [[Anita Pallenberg]], [[David Blaine]], [[Werner Herzog]] and Mal Whiteley. The movie was released in 2008 and debuted at Cannes.<ref>[http://european-films.net/content/view/642/107/ european-films.net – preview: Harmony Korine's Mister Lonely<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> His largest film with a budget of $8.2 million,<ref>[http://www.harmony-korine.com/ScreenIntl.pdf Screen International Magazine, "Only The Lonely" by Fionnuala Halligan, Feb 2, 2007 p34-35]</ref> it received mixed reviews and earned $386,915 in its first 9 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=misterlonely.htm |title=Mister Lonely (2008) |accessdate=2009-02-12 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>

The film is the story of "a young American man lost in Paris. He scratches out a living as a [[Michael Jackson]] look-alike, dancing in the streets, in public parks, at tourist spots and trade shows. Different from everyone else, he feels as if he's floating between two worlds. During a show at a geriatric home Michael Jackson meets [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Haunted by her angelic beauty he follows her to a commune in the Highlands, joining her husband [[Charlie Chaplin]] and her daughter [[Shirley Temple]]. The commune is a place where everyone is famous and "no-one gets old". Here, The [[Pope]], The [[list of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England|Queen of England]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[James Dean]] and other impersonators build a stage in the hope that the world will visit and watch them perform. Everything is beautiful. Until the world shifts, and reality intrudes on their utopian dream."<ref name="korines">{{Cite web|url=http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/main/news.html|title=Harmony-Korine.com – News|accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref>

Korine also appeared in the 2007 [[documentary film]] ''[[Beautiful Losers (film)|Beautiful Losers]]'' in which his life and career were one of the foci of the film, along with other artists such as [[Mike Mills (director)|Mike Mills]], [[Shepard Fairey]], Margaret Kilgallen, Jo Jackson and [[Barry McGee]]. In the documentary, Korine discusses his motivation as an artist and filmmaker, as well as his inspiration for creating films he has never seen. Footage also appears from one of Korine's rare, early, and untitled short films, which preceded his work on ''Kids''.

In 2008 Harmony Korine was signed to MJZ for worldwide commercial representation.

In March 2011, Korine released a short film entitled [[Umshini wami|Umshini Wam]], which is a popular [[Zulu language|Zulu]] struggle song meaning "bring me my machine gun". The film starred Ninja and Yo-Landi of [[Die Antwoord]]. In September 2011, Korine released a short film entitled ''Snowballs'', sponsored by the [[Proenza Schouler]] fashion label.

===''Spring Breakers''===
Korine's next project was the crime drama ''[[Spring Breakers]]'', which was produced in 2012 in [[Florida]], and starred [[James Franco]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]], [[Ashley Benson]], and Korine's wife, [[Rachel Korine]]. In looking at early scenes being filmed and in speaking toward the plot, cast, and earlier works of the filmmaker, ''[[Indiewire]]'' wrote "this might be the weirdest movie the director has ever made simply by nature of being totally unlike his previous work."<ref name=IW/> "That Mr. Korine appears to be having it both (or many) ways may seem like a cop-out, but only if you believe that the role of the artist is to be a didact or a scold."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/movies/spring-breakers-directed-by-harmony-korine.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=2&pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | first=Manohla | last=Dargis | title=‘Spring Breakers,' Directed by Harmony Korine | date=2013-03-14}}</ref> wrote The New York Times.

==Other works==

===Books===
Korine has also published a number of books. In 1995 a screenplay for ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]'' was published by [[Grove Press]], followed by a collection of the screenplays for ''[[Gummo]]'', ''[[Julien Donkey-Boy]]'', and ''Jokes'' in ''Collected Screenplays'', published by [[Faber and Faber]] in 2002. In 2008 the screenplay for ''[[Mister Lonely]]'' was released by Swiss publisher [[Nieves]] with photographs by Rachel Korine and Brent Stewart. The majority of these books differ substantially from the movies eventually produced.

In 1998 Korine published a book entitled ''[[A Crack Up at the Race Riots]]'', an experimental novel, described as his attempt to write "the Great American [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] novel" in his appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman. Korine was eventually banned from Letterman's show after he was caught going thrugh [[Meryl Streep]]'s purse after breaking into her dressing room. In November 2008, [[Drag City (publishing company)|Drag City]] published a collection of his fanzines called ''[[The Collected Fanzines]]'' with skateboarder/writer Mark Gonzalez. 2009 sees Korine returning to the collaborative zine process alongside fellow avant-garde artist [[Noel Sinclair Boyt]].<ref>{{Cite web | title= Interview: Harmony Korine On His New Collected Fanzines| url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2008/11/interview_harmo.ph | format= }} {{Dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref>

===Art===
Korine released a number of photographic collections, usually in conjunction with gallery exhibits. In 1998 he published ''The Bad Son'' in conjunction with Taka Ishii gallery in Tokyo, documenting his various photo shoots with [[Macaulay Culkin]]. In 2002, ''Pass the Bitch Chicken'' was released, a collaboration with artist Christopher Wool, which consists of Korine's photographs heavily edited by Korine and Wool. In 2009 he published ''Pigxote'' in conjunction with the [[Vanderbilt University]] Fine Arts Gallery and released by [[Nieves]]. The university describes the exhibition, which ran through February 26, 2009, as culling "together a number of photographs from Korine’s private files in order to reveal a side of the artist’s creative process that remains largely unexamined. Depicting an unnamed, mysterious young girl moving through a televised landscape of shifting contexts, Pigxote further illustrates Korine’s interest in replacing plot lines and expected narrative tropes with intuitively arranged “experiential moments.” They also provide a unique insight into the poetic mind of Nashville’s most compelling prodigal son."<ref>[{{citation | title= Vanderbilt University}}</ref> Most recently his works were presented in a 2003 exhibition at [[agnès b]]'s Galerie du jour in Paris, with whom Korine has often been associated. In 2010, Korine collaborated with New York Visual Artist Bill Saylor on the book ''Ho Bags.'' The book consists of drawing and paintings in which Korine and Saylor drew over each others works. In 2011 Korine collaborated with the New York brand [[Supreme (clothing)|Supreme]], releasing a set of two skateboard decks featuring original artworks by Korine.

===Commercials===
Harmony Korine directed a commercial for [[Dior| Dior Addict Fragrance]].

===Music===
Korine has directed a number of music videos for artists such as [[Sonic Youth]], [[Cat Power]] and [[Will Oldham]] (e.g., [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aoUKuytnSQ No More Workhorse Blues]). In addition, he sang on Oldham's "Ease Down The Road", and co-authored the lyrics of [[Björk]]'s musical composition "Harm of Will" from her album ''[[Vespertine]]'' (2001). In 1999 Korine and Brian Degraw of [[Gang Gang Dance]] released a music [[Compact Disc|CD]] ''SSAB Songs''. "I don't really know what it sounds like", Korine explained to ''[[i-D]]'' magazine. "I only listened to it once. I think it's the kind of album I'd only listen to once". The tracks labeled "Harmony" on ''[[Songs in A&E]]'' are named after Korine by [[Jason Pierce]] of [[Spiritualized]], who also made the soundtrack to ''[[Mister Lonely]]''. "Harmony Korine" is the lead track on the solo album ''[[Insurgentes (album)|Insurgentes]]'' by Porcupine Tree lead singer [[Steven Wilson]]. He has also directed a music video for "[[Gold on the Ceiling]]" by [[The Black Keys]], from their album ''[[El Camino (The Black Keys album)|El Camino]]''. He co-wrote the song "Florida Kilos" with [[Lana Del Rey]] and [[Dan Auerbach]], which is featured on the deluxe edition of Del Rey's album ''[[Ultraviolence (album)|Ultraviolence]]''.

==Themes and influence==
Much of Korine's work is based around the [[Black comedy|dark humor]] and [[absurdism]] involved in dysfunctional childhoods, mental disorders, and poverty.<ref name="journal">{{Cite web|url=http://www.atypon-link.com/INT/doi/abs/10.1386/ncin.3.2.115/1?journalCode=ncin|title=Harmony Korine|accessdate=2007-01-18|publisher=Journal of Contemporary Film|year=2005|author=White, Duncan}}</ref> This is often incorporated into surrealist, non-linear forms and presented experimentally (see the mix of [[instant film|Polaroids]], [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] and [[35mm film]] that makes up ''[[Gummo]]''). [[Blackface]], [[tap-dance]], and [[minstrel]]sy are common elements to Korine's work.<ref>http://www.believermag.com/issues/201003/?read=interview_korine</ref> "I'm a huge fan of vaudeville – like [[Fanny Brice]], [[Eddie Cantor]], and [[Al Jolson]]...

"[http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/indexmag.html Harmony Korine Interview]." Index Magazine.

On their own each photo would be seemingly random and devoid of context, but because they are compiled in one volume and presented in succession, a narrative exists. "That's how ''Gummo'' was written."<ref name="walczak"/> [[Improvisation]] is also an important filmmaking technique for Korine, as a way to maintain his movies as "living thing[s]."<ref name=Bishop/> Korine does not try to write messages or meanings into his scripts, as he finds it belittling to the audience.

Despite the scorn of a majority of mainstream reviewers, he has won festival prizes at Venice and Rotterdam, among others, and established directors such as [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] and [[Gus Van Sant]] are outspoken proponents of Korine's work. On ''[[Gummo]]'' Van Sant said it "changed his life"<ref name="forward">Van Sant, Gus. 1997 "[http://www.harmony-korine.com/paper/int/hk/forward.html Gummo Website Forward].

The [[Toronto International Film Festival]] writes, "Such is the dilemma with Korine and his remarkable career; for all the fireworks, there is an impressive coherence in the subject matter of his work. His four feature films all seek to shed light on a certain class of people: unique and bizarre individuals usually lumped under the heading of 'subculture.' ... His portraits come from many angles – the baroque stillness of ''[[Gummo]]'' contrasts radically with the rough-hewn melodrama of ''[[Julien Donkey-Boy]]''. His last film, ''[[Mister Lonely]]'', had an epic quality and interest in celebrity that ''[[Trash Humpers]]'' disdains, preferring instead a low-end surveillance-video look with frequent in-camera lighting distortions and a [[cinéma-vérité]] authenticity.<ref name="tiff">Cowan, Noah.

On the current state of cinema, Korine comments, "When I look at the history of film – the early commercial narrative movies directed by [[D.W. Griffith]], say – and then look at where films are now, I see so little progression in the way they are made and presented, and I'm bored with that. Film can be so much more."<ref name="whammo"/>

On looking for meaning in his films Korine states, "I think people will lose the film as soon as they start trying to figure out my logic or what I'm doing or while they're watching it start to dissect metaphors... I'm not really so interested in it working on a purely cerebral level. I'm much more concerned with it on an emotional level and that you leave feeling a certain way."<ref name="Boy Makes World"/> Korine states that if there is at least one image that sticks with you after viewing the film, then it is a success.<ref name="forward"/>

Producer [[Cary Woods]] writes, "I think the best hope for cinema is allowing people who are artists to make a movie that isn't wholly ruled by screenplay structure... [Korine's] a storyteller, and he's gone out of his way to put images that are moving on the screen, and meaningful in some way."<ref name="forward"/>

As critic [[Roger Ebert]] said in his review of ''Julien Donkey-Boy'', "Korine, who at 25 is one of the most untamed new directors, belongs on the list with [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]], [[John Cassavetes|Cassavetes]], [[Werner Herzog|Herzog]], [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]], [[Andrei Tarkovsky|Tarkovsky]], [[Stan Brakhage|Brakhage]] and others who smash conventional movies and reassemble the pieces... Harmony Korine is the real thing, an innovative and gifted filmmaker whose work forces us to see on his terms."<ref name="ebert" />

In 1997, Korine's favorite writers were listed as [[James Thurber]], [[S. J. Perelman]], and [[Flannery O'Connor]].<ref name="forward"/> Korine has noted British filmmaker [[Alan Clarke]] as an influence.<ref name="kelly">Kelly, Mike. Fall 1997.
