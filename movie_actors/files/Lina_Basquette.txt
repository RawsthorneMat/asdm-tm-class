'''Lina Basquette,''' born '''Lena Copeland Baskette''' (April 19, 1907 – September 30, 1994), was an American actress noted for her 75-year career in entertainment, which began during the [[silent film]] era. Talented as a dancer, she was paid as a girl for performing and gained her first film contract at age nine. In her acting career, Basquette may have been best known for her role as Judith in ''[[The Godless Girl]]'' (1929) The film was based on the life of Queen Silver, known as a 20th-century child prodigy, and [[feminist]] and [[Socialist]] activist.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Queen-Silver-Godless-Studies-Amherst/dp/1573927554 Wendy McElroy, ''Queen Silver: The Godless Girl'', Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 1999]</ref>

Basquette also was noted for her several marriages, including her first, to the much older noted producer, [[Sam Warner]], founder of [[Warner Bros.]] film studio. She had several marriages and a tumultuous personal life.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/06/obituaries/lina-basquette-silent-film-star-and-dog-breeder-is-dead-at-87.html|title=Lina Basquette, Silent-Film Star And Dog Breeder, Is Dead at 87|date=October 6, 1994|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}</ref> When her film career declined, she returned for a period to dancing and stage performances. After she retired from the entertainment world, in 1947 Basquette moved to [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], where she became a noted [[dog breeder|breeder]] of [[Great Danes]]; her dogs won numerous professional show prizes. She wrote several books on dog breeding as well. Later living in West Virginia, she also served as a judge for the [[American Kennel Club]], and wrote a column.

==Early years==
She was born '''Lena Copeland Baskette''' to Frank Baskette, a drugstore owner, and his wife Gladys Baskette (née Rosenberg) in [[San Mateo, California]]. She began dancing as a child. An [[RCA Victor]] representative saw her dancing to a record in her father's store. He hired her at the age of eight (through her parents) to advertise [[Victrola]]s at the 1915 [[Panama–Pacific International Exposition]], held in [[San Francisco]]. Basquette later began studying [[ballet]].<ref name="oliver">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-05/news/mn-46631_1_lina-basquette|title=Lina Basquette; Star of Silent Movies|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|date=October 5, 1994|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref><ref name="latimes">{{cite news|title=Lina Basquette: Her Life Is Screenplay Material Movies|last=Thomas|first=Kevin|date=August 23, 1991|work=The Los Angeles Times|page=16}}</ref>

Baskette secured her first film contract at the age of nine in 1916 with [[Universal Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]] for the silent film series, ''Lena Baskette Featurettes''.<ref name=nytimes/><ref name="latimes" /> Shortly after she was signed with Universal, her father Frank Baskette committed [[suicide]]. Baskette later blamed her father's death on her mother's ambition for fame and fortune.<ref name="brownlow"/>

Within a year, Gladys Baskette married dance director Ernest Belcher. Their daughter [[Marge Champion|Marjorie Belcher]], half-sister to Lina, was born in 1919 in Los Angeles, where the family was then living. Marjorie became a dancer and choreographer known as Marge Champion.<ref name="brownlow">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lina-basquette-1441595.html|title=Obituary: Lina Basquette|last=Brownlow|first=Kevin|date=October 8, 1994|publisher=''The Independent''|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early success===
In 1923, Baskette and her mother traveled across the country by train to [[New York City]], so that the girl could audition for [[John Murray Anderson]]. Anderson urged her to change the spelling of her surname from "Baskette" to "Basquette". Producer [[Charles Dillingham]] changed the spelling of her first name from "Lena" to "Lina" saying, "Lena is a cook, Lina is an artiste."<ref name="brownlow" />

Before she could sign with Anderson, [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] cast the 16-year-old Basquette in his [[Ziegfeld Follies]] and cast her as a featured dancer. The Follies producers officially dubbed her "America's Prima Ballerina." The girl gained notice from Russian [[prima ballerina]] [[Anna Pavlova]], who wanted to mentor her in classical ballet. Her mother Gladys Baskette decided that a career as a ballerina would not yield enough money and turned down Pavolva's offer. Basquette later said, "I dreamed of being in a ballet company and it broke my heart."<ref name="brownlow" />

==Marriage and family==
By 1925, at age 18 Basquette was appearing in two concurrent Ziegfeld productions. She was spotted in ''Louie the 14th'' by [[Sam Warner]], film producer and co-founder of [[Warner Bros.]] studio. Warner instantly fell in love with her and proposed marriage. Basquette did not want to marry him, as he was considerably older than she. Her mother insisted that Basquette accept Warner's proposal, believing that the producer was wealthy (at the time, Warner Bros. was losing money).<ref name="brownlow" />

Basquette and Warner were married in July 1925. After the marriage, Basquette grew to love and respect Warner; the couple had a daughter, Lita, in 1926. Warner died suddenly on October 5, 1927, the day before the opening of the highly anticipated Warner Bros. film, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', which he had been working on tirelessly. Basquette was devastated by his death. She spent years battling Warner's family over money and custody of the couple's daughter.<ref name="brownlow" />

==Return to films==
Basquette returned to work in 1928, appearing in four films. That year, she was named one of thirteen [[WAMPAS Baby Stars]]. The following year, she appeared in ''[[The Younger Generation]]'', directed by [[Frank Capra]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Liebman|first=Roy |title=The Wampas Baby Stars: A Biographical Dictionary, 1922-1934|year=2000|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-40756-5|page=23}}</ref>

In 1929, she starred in the partially sound film, ''[[The Godless Girl]]'', directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. This is the role for which she is best known. Basquette plays the title character Judith, who is based on Queen Silver, a child prodigy who early made speeches as a [[Socialist]] activist. Judith is the leader of a high school [[atheist]] society; she forces members to renounce [[The Bible]] while placing a hand on the head of a live monkey.

In the film's climactic scene, DeMille insisted on realism while filming the reformatory going up in flames. During the filming, Basquette's eyelashes and eyebrows were burned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YKJdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7VwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=3992,6085929&dq=lina+basquette+marriages&hl=en|title=Lina Basquette, silent screen star, dies at the age of 87|date=October 6, 1994|work=The Telegraph|pages=A–7|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> ''The Godless Girl'' was not a box office success in the United States, but it did well in [[Austria]] and [[Germany]]. Basquette later recalled that she received a fan letter from [[Adolf Hitler]] (before he achieved his political power) saying that she was his favorite movie star.<ref name="brownlow" />

===Decline===
After appearing in ''The Godless Girl'', Basquette found her popularity declining and she was offered fewer film roles. She was unofficially blacklisted in Hollywood due to her legal battles with the Warner family, which was trying to take custody of her daughter with Sam Warner in order to rear her as Jewish, and challenged settlement of his estate.<ref name="brownlow" /> She made a successful transition to sound films and appeared in some [[Western (genre)|Western]] films in the 1930s.<ref name="smith">{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-04-22/features/1991112176_1_portuguese-water-dogs-ballerina-basquette|title=She's 84, doggone stylish and a rare breed|last=Smith|first=Linell|date=April 22, 1991|publisher=baltimoresun.com|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref>

In January 1937, Basquette was offered a contract with the [[Universum Film AG]] studio in [[Germany]], after the Nazi Party had taken power. After arriving in Germany, she was driven to [[Berchtesgaden]], where she met [[Führer]] Adolf Hitler, [[Rudolf Hess]], and [[Joseph Goebbels]]. She later claimed that Hitler made a pass at her, and she kicked him in the groin.<ref name="brownlow" /> When he persisted, Basquette told him that her maternal grandfather was Jewish. She left Germany the following day.<ref>{{cite book|last=Slide|first=Anthony |title=Silent Players: A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film Actors and Actresses|year=2002|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-813-12249-X|page=16}}</ref>

As her career in films continued to decline, Basquette returned to dancing. She performed in nightclubs and on the [[vaudeville]] circuit.<ref name="milwaukee">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZLUWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GyMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1982,4290860&dq=lina+basquette+henry+mollison+divorce&hl=en|title=Divorce in Prospect for Lina Basquette|date=October 26, 1944|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=2|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> In 1939, Basquette and her fifth husband, English actor [[Henry Mollison]], appeared on stage together in ''Idiot's Delight'', which toured in the United States, [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?pid=3HtVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kJYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6769,2525700&dq=lina+basquette+henry+mollison&hl=en|title=Star of Stage and Screen For "Idiot's Delight"|date=January 19, 1939|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|page=4|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> After appearing in 1943's ''[[A Night for Crime]]'', Basquette retired from films.<ref name="smith" />

==Later years==
On August 9, 1943, Basquette was [[rape]]d and robbed in [[Burbank, California]], after she gave a ride to 22-year old [[United States Army|Army]] [[Private (rank)|Private]] George Paul Rimke. Basquette later testified that after she picked up the soldier, he forced her into the backseat and raped her. Rimke denied the charges but was found guilty on August 26, 1943 and sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9ZkgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=nWgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3376,3618635&dq=lina+basquette+rape&hl=en|title=Clear Courtoom In Basquette Rape Case|date=August 26, 1943|work=The Lewiston Daily Sun|page=2|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4iwaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_SQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6610,4209135&dq=lina+basquette+henry+mollison&hl=en|title=Army Private Convicted On Actress' Story|date=August 26, 1943|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=1|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref>

In 1947, Basquette used money from a trust fund left to her by her first husband, Sam Warner, and purchased a farm in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]]. In 1950, she and her sixth husband Warner Gilmore opened Honey Hollow Kennels; they began breeding and showing [[Great Dane]]s. Basquette went on to become the single biggest winner of Great Dane breed shows and was known as a noted dog breeder. She also wrote several books on the subject of dog breeding.

She retired from dog handling in 1983. Basquette moved to [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], after her retirement. She continued to judge dog shows for the [[American Kennel Club]] and also wrote a monthly column for ''Kennel Review''.<ref name="oliver" /><ref name="latimes" /><ref name="smith" />

Renewed interest in Basquette's films was sparked after a profile of her was published in 1989 in ''[[The New Yorker]].'' Her films were screened in [[Washington, DC]] at the [[National Gallery of Art]] and at the Silent Movie Theatre in [[Los Angeles]].

Basquette published her autobiography, ''Lina: DeMille's Godless Girl'', in 1991. That same year she was cast in her first film in 48 years, an independent production titled ''Paradise Park''. She played a grandmother who dreamed God was coming to grant a wish to residents of an Appalachian trailer park. The film also stars [[Porter Wagoner]] and [[Johnny Paycheck]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RjpLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WCMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4945,5066174&dq=lina+basquette+paradise+park&hl=en|title=Poverty tale has upbeat message|date=January 28, 1992|work=The Press-Courier|page=2|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> It was her final film role.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===
Basquette's first marriage was to [[Sam Warner]], film producer and co-founder of [[Warner Bros.]] studio. The two were married on July 4, 1925, despite Warner's family's disapproval because Basquette was not [[Jewish]]. They had a daughter, Lita (named after [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s wife [[Lita Grey]]) in October 1926.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eyman|first=Scott|title=The Speed of Sound: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution 1926-1930|year=1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=1-439-10428-X|page=98}}</ref> After suffering severe headaches and a sinus infection aggravated by several [[Tooth abscess|abscessed teeth]], Warner was admitted to California Lutheran Hospital in September 1927. Doctors discovered that he had developed a [[mastoid]] infection that was spreading to his brain. After four surgeries to remove the infection, Warner slipped into a coma. He died of [[pneumonia]] caused by [[sinusitis]] and [[Epidural space|epidural]] and [[Subdural space|subdural]] abscesses on October 5, 1927.<ref>Eyman (1997) pp.137-138</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PjEiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6aYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2564,345070&dq=sam+warner+lina+lita&hl=en|title=Sam Warner, Noted Film Magnate Dies|date=October 5, 1927|work=Berkeley Daily Gazette|page=1|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref>

In January 1929, Basquette married cinematographer [[Peverell Marley]].<ref name=lewiston>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YIwgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fWYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5635,5536453&dq=lina+basquette+divorce&hl=en|title=Lina Basquette Divorced By Her Second Husband|date=September 11, 1930|work=The Lewiston Daily Sun|page=13|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref> Shortly after the marriage, [[Harry Warner]], Sam Warner's older brother, asked Basquette give up custody of her daughter Lita. He was concerned that she would raise Lita as a Roman Catholic like her, rather than in the Jewish faith. Basquette said that she and Sam Warner had agreed to raise any female children they had as Catholic and any male children as Jewish. Harry Warner and his wife offered Basquette large amounts of money to relinquish custody but she refused.<ref name="brownlow" /> She finally relented after Harry Warner promised her that Lita would receive a $300,000 trust fund.<ref name="latimes" /> On March 30, 1930, Harry Warner and his wife were awarded legal custody of Lita.<ref>Eyman 1997 p.361</ref> Basquette quickly regretted her decision and tried to regain custody of her daughter.<ref name="brownlow" />

In August 1930, Basquette left Marley as she tried to regain custody of Lita. When custody was denied, she attempted [[suicide]] by drinking poison at a party. She was saved when a guest heard her screams.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19300814&id=hiQeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xI4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=1425,5649049|title=Star Regrets Suicide Trial|date=August 14, 1930|work=The Pittsburgh Press|page=10|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref> Marley and Basquette were divorced in September 1930.<ref name=lewiston />

Basquette was never financially stable enough to regain custody of her daughter. The Warner family filed several legal suits against her to win back Sam Warner's share of Warner Bros. studio.<ref name="latimes" /> Over the next 20 years, Basquette saw Lita on only two occasions: in 1935, when Harry Warner and his family moved to Los Angeles, and in 1947, when Lita married Dr. Nathan Hiatt.<ref name=warner>{{cite book|last1=Warner Sperling|first1=Cass |last2=Millner|first2=Cork|last3=Warner|first3=Jack|title=Hollywood Be Thy Name: The Warner Brothers Story|year=1994|publisher=Prima Pub.|isbn=1-559-58343-6|page=265}}</ref> Basquette and her daughter reconnected in 1977 when Basquette backed a lawsuit that Lita brought against her uncle [[Jack Warner]]'s estate.<ref name="latimes" />

Basquette's third marriage was to actor Ray Hallam in 1931. He died of [[leukemia]] three weeks after they were married.<ref name=warner /> On October 31, 1931, she married Theodore Hayes, the former trainer of world heavyweight boxing champion [[Jack Dempsey]]. After discovering that Hayes was still married to another woman, Basquette was granted a Mexican divorce on September 10, 1932.<ref>"Lina Basquette Is Divorced From Business Agent." ''[[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]] Signal''. September 11, 1932, Page 1.</ref>

In her autobiography, Basquette said that, while she and Hayes were separated, she had an affair with Jack Dempsey. Dempsey ended the affair in July 1932, after which Basquette attempted suicide a second time. She and Hayes eventually reconciled and remarried in 1934.<ref name="formanek">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nxEwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RQMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7010,7842482&dq=lina+basquette+theodore+hayes&hl=en|title=Great-grandmother returns to her career roots|last=Formanek|first=Ray, Jr.|date=September 29, 1991|work=Toledo Blade|pages=G–5|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> They had a son, Edward Alvin Hayes, in April 1934.

In April 1937, Basquette married British actor [[Henry Mollison]] in [[London]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eO8uAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5NsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2911,2303656&dq=lina+basquette+henry+mollison&hl=en|title=Lina Basquette and Henry Mollison Married|date=June 19, 1937|work=Ottawa Citizen|page=1|accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> They separated in 1940, and divorced in October 1944.<ref name="milwaukee" />

In 1947, she married Warner Gilmore, the general manager of the St. Moritz Hotel. They divorced in 1951.<ref name="smith" /> Basquette's final marriage was to artist Frank Mancuso. They married in 1959 and separated that same year, but they never bothered to get legally divorced.<ref name="smith" />

==Death==
On September 30, 1994, Basquette died of [[lymphoma]] at her home in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], at the age of 87.<ref name="oliver" /> She was survived by her half-sister Marge Champion, two children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.<ref name=nytimes />
