'''Luis Buñuel Portolés''' ({{IPA-es|ˈlwiz βuˈɲwel portoˈles}}; 22 February 1900 – 29 July 1983) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Filmmaking|filmmaker]] who worked in [[Spain]], [[Mexico]] and [[France]].<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">{{cite web|last=Kyrou|first=Ado|title=Luis Buñuel|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/84784/Luis-Bunuel|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref>

When Luis Buñuel died at age 83, his [[obituary]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' called him "an iconoclast, moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of [[avant-garde]] [[surrealism]] in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later".<ref>{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Peter B.|title=Luis Buñuel Dies at 83; Filmmaker for 50 Years|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/30/obituaries/luis-bunuel-dies-at-83-film-maker-for-50-years.html|accessdate=6 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=30 July 1983}}</ref>  His [[Un Chien Andalou|first picture]]—made in the [[silent film|silent era]]—was called "the most famous short film ever made" by critic [[Roger Ebert]],<ref name=ebert>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Un Chien Andalou (1928)|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000416/REVIEWS08/401010369/1023/|work=Great Movies: The First 100|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=6 August 2012|date=16 April 2000}}</ref> and his [[That Obscure Object of Desire|last film]]—made 48 years later—won him Best Director awards from the [[National Board of Review]] and the [[National Society of Film Critics]].<ref name="Ramirez Berg">{{cite web|last=Berg|first=Charles Ramírez|title=That Obscure Object of Desire, 1977|url=http://www.austinfilm.org/essential-cinema/program-notes-that-obscure-object-of-desire|publisher=Austin Film Society|accessdate=6 August 2012}}</ref>  Writer [[Octavio Paz]] called Buñuel's work "the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality...scandalous and subversive".<ref name=paz>{{cite book|last=Paz|first=Octavio|title=On Poets and Others|year=1986|publisher=Arcade Publishing|location=New York|isbn=1-55970-139-0|pages=152|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qoiEQ4FiuFsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

Often associated with the [[surrealist movement]] of the 1920s, Buñuel created films from the 1920s through the 1970s. His work spans two continents, three languages, and nearly every film genre, including [[experimental film]], [[Documentary film|documentary]], [[Melodrama#Film|melodrama]], [[satire]], [[Musical film|musical]], [[Sex in film|erotica]], [[Comedy film|comedy]], [[Mockumentary]], [[Romance film|romance]], [[costume drama]]s, [[Fantasy film|fantasy]], [[crime film]], [[Adventure film|adventure]], and [[Western (genre)#Film|western]].  Despite this variety, filmmaker [[John Huston]] believed that, regardless of genre, a Buñuel film is so distinctive as to be instantly recognizable,<ref>{{cite book|last=Sinyard|first=Neil|title="The Discreet Charm of Houston and Buñuel: Notes on a Cinematic Odd Couple", in John Huston: Essays on a Restless Director, ed.

==Early years (1900–1924)==
[[File:Vista parcial de Calanda. Foto José Antonio Bielsa.JPG|thumb|right||Calanda, Spain|Calanda]]
Buñuel was born in [[Calanda, Spain|Calanda]], a small town in the [[Teruel (province)|province of Teruel]], in the [[Aragon]] region of Spain, to Leonardo Buñuel, the cultivated scion of an established Aragonese family, and María Portolés, many years younger than her husband, with wealth and family connections of her own.<ref name=Alcala>{{cite book|last=Alcalá|first=Manuel|title=Buñuel (Cine e ideologia)|year=1973|publisher=Edicusa|location=Madrid|isbn=84-229-0101-3}}</ref>{{rp|pp.16–17}} He would later describe his birthplace by saying that in Calanda, "the [[Middle Ages]] lasted until [[World War&nbsp;I]]".<ref>Buñuel, Luis.

When Buñuel was just four and a half months old, the family moved to [[Zaragoza]], where they were one of the wealthiest families in town.<ref name=Alcala />{{rp|p.22}} In Zaragoza, Buñuel received a strict [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] education at the private Colegio del Salvador.<ref name=Alcala />{{rp|pp.23–36}} After being kicked and insulted by the study hall proctor before a final exam, Buñuel refused to return to the school.<ref name="directors guide" />  He told his mother he had been expelled, which was not true; in fact, he had received the highest marks on his world history exam.<ref>Buñuel, Luis.

In his youth, Buñuel was deeply religious, serving at Mass and taking Communion every day, until, at age 16, he grew disgusted with what he perceived as the illogicality of the Church, along with its power and wealth.<ref name=brandon>{{cite book|last=Brandon|first=Ruth|title=Surreal Lives: The Surrealists 1917–1945|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=0-8021-3727-X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9_Z0rVDhNGsC&pg=PA291&lpg=PA291&dq=bunuel+agronomy&source=bl&ots=6yevIxqmhS&sig=KUUXc0FbHl6n9lANT-LEyxorH1Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IPAOULv4N6Lc2AXa24CYBw&ved=0CEkQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=bunuel%20agronomy&f=false}}</ref>{{rp|p.292}}

Although we seemed to have little in common—I was a redneck from Aragon, and he an elegant Andalusian—we spent most of our time together... We used to sit on the grass in the evenings behind the Residencia (at that time, there were vast open spaces reaching to the horizon), and he would read me his poems. He read slowly and beautifully, and through him I began to discover a wholly new world."<ref name="my last sigh">{{cite book|last=Buñuel|first=Luis|title=My last sigh|year=1983|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-394-52854-9}}</ref>{{rp|p.62}} Buñuel's relationship with Dalí was somewhat more troubled, being tinged with jealousy over the growing intimacy between Dalí and Lorca and resentment over Dalí's early success as an artist.<ref name=brandon />{{rp|p.300}}

Starting when he was 17, he steadily dated the future poet and dramatist [[Concha Mendez]], with whom he vacationed every summer at [[San Sebastián]], introducing her as his fiancée to his friends at the Residencia.<ref name=bellver>{{cite book|last=Bellver|first=Catherine Gullo|title=Absence and Presence: Spanish Women Poets of the Twenties and Thirties|year=2001|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg, PA|isbn=978-0-8387-5463-4|pages=232}}</ref><ref name=wilcox>{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=John Chapman|title=Women Poets of Spain, 1860–1990: Toward a Gynocentric Vision|year=1997|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-06559-0|pages=125|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=i8RlmBiUl68C&pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&dq=concha+mendez+bunuel&source=bl&ots=_x2WNDQIUg&sig=4aPLVXaZw-41pVoIUMYBH-kWEWc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Xv0VUKCcBpCg8QTDwoCQCg&sqi=2&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=concha%20mendez%20bunuel&f=false}}</ref>   After five years, she broke off the relationship, citing Buñuel's "insufferable character".<ref name=agonia.net>{{cite web|title=Biografia Concha Mendez Cuesta|url=http://portugues.agonia.net/index.php/author/0028634/index.html|publisher=Agonia.Net|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>

During his student years, Buñuel became an accomplished hypnotist. He claimed that once, while calming a hysterical prostitute through [[hypnosis|hypnotic]] suggestion, he inadvertently put one of the several bystanders into a trance as well.<ref name="my last sigh" />{{rp|p.67}} He was often to insist that watching movies was a form of hypnosis:  "This kind of cinematographic hypnosis is no doubt due to the darkness of the theatre and to the rapidly changing scenes, lights, and camera movements, which weaken the spectator's critical intelligence and exercise over him a kind of fascination."<ref name="my last sigh" />{{rp|p.69}}

Buñuel's interest in films was intensified by a viewing of [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Destiny (1921 film)|Der müde Tod]]'': "I came out of the [[Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier|Vieux Colombier]] [theater] completely transformed. Images could and did become for me the true means of expression. I decided to devote myself to the cinema".<ref name="Buffalo Film Seminars 1">{{cite web|last=Christian|first=Diane, and Bruce Jackson|title=Luis Buñuel That Obscure Object of Desire/  Cet obscur oject du désir 1977|url=http://csac.buffalo.edu/desire.pdf|work=Buffalo Film Seminars|publisher=Market Arcade Film & Arts Center and State University of New York at Buffalo|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>  At age 72, Buñuel had not lost his enthusiasm for this film, asking the octogenarian Lang for his autograph.<ref name=brandon />{{rp|p.301}}

===Early French period  (1925–1931)===
[[File:Jean epstein 1920.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jean Epstein]], Buñuel's first film collaborator]]

He decided to enter the film industry and enrolled in a private film school run by [[Jean Epstein]] and some associates.<ref name=williams />  At that time, Epstein was one of the most celebrated commercial directors working in France, his films being hailed as "the triumph of [[impressionism]] in motion, but also the triumph of the modern spirit".<ref name=sadoul>{{cite book|last=Sadoul|first=Georges|title=Dictionary of Film Makers|year=1972|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley & Los Angeles|isbn=0-520-02151-7|pages=77|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PvsZikRu-hAC&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=jean+epstein+reputation&source=bl&ots=LnkfJmhACb&sig=ZLbUmcnDVCGPu_mi0-4JQIaKDA4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=x14UUPKTMpOy8ASPlYHoCA&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=jean%20epstein%20reputation&f=false}}</ref>   Before long, Buñuel was working for Epstein as an assistant director on ''[[Mauprat]]'' (1926) and ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher (1928 French film)|La chute de la maison Usher]]'' (1928),<ref name=edwards>{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Gwynne|title=A Companion to Luís Buñuel|year=2005|publisher=Tamesis|location=Woodbridge|isbn=1-85566-108-X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r5_VlQTnbD0C&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=bunuel+epstein&source=bl&ots=5RHY0nlLSz&sig=xW_DYdKhskp04SHBN3fBxHgh8hA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m-EMUI68AarI2AXP6KEQ&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=bunuel%20baker&f=false}}</ref> and also for [[Mario Nalpas]] on ''La Sirène des Tropiques'' (1927), starring [[Josephine Baker]].<ref name=fandor>{{cite web|title=Siren of the Tropics|url=http://www.fandor.com/films/siren_of_the_tropics|work=fandor|publisher=Our Film Festival, Inc.|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref>  He appeared on screen in a small part as a smuggler in [[Jacques Feyder]]'s ''Carmen'' (1926).<ref name="brain juice">{{cite web|title=Luis Buñuel|url=http://www.brain-juice.com/cgi-bin/show_bio.cgi?p_id=136|work=brain-juice|publisher=Brain-Juice.Com, Inc|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref>

When Buñuel somewhat derisively refused to acquiesce to Epstein's demand that he assist Epstein's mentor, [[Abel Gance]], who was at the time working on the film ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]'', Epstein dismissed him angrily, saying "How can a little asshole like you dare to talk that way about a great director like Gance?"<ref name=talens />{{rp|p.30}} then added "You seem rather surrealist.

The script was written in six days at Dalí's home in [[Cadaqués]]. In a letter to a friend written in February 1929, Buñuel described the writing process: "We had to look for the plot line.

====''L'Age d'Or'' (1930)====
Late in 1929, on the strength of ''Un Chien Andalou'', Buñuel and Dalí were commissioned to make another short film by [[Marie-Laure de Noailles|Marie-Laurie]] and [[Charles de Noailles]], owners of a private cinema on the [[Place des États-Unis]] and financial supporters of productions by Jacques Manuel, [[Man Ray]] and [[Pierre Chenal]].<ref name="bfi vol 3" />{{rp|p.124}}  At first, the intent was that the new film be around the same length as ''Un Chien'', only this time with sound.

Ehrlich, of [[United Artists]], to co-produce a film version of [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', using a script developed by the Canadian writer [[Hugo Butler]], another emigre from Hollywood who had run afoul of authorities seeking out communists.<ref name=schreiber />{{rp|p.75}}  The result, ''[[Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]'', was Buñuel's first color film.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Ed|title=The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-adventures-of-robinson-crusoe|website=Slant Magazine|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref>  Buñuel was given much more time than usual for the filming (three months), which was accomplished on location in Manzanillo, a Pacific seaport with a lush jungle interior, and was shot simultaneously in English and Spanish.<ref name="axmaker robinson crusoe">{{cite web|last1=Axmaker|first1=Sean|title=Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1954)|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/66823/Adventures-of-Robinson-Crusoe/articles.html|website=Turner Classic Movies|publisher=Turner Entertainment Networks|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref>  When the film was released in the United States, its young star [[Dan O'Herlihy]] used his own money to fund a Los Angeles run for the film and gave free admission to all members of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], who in turn rewarded the little-known actor with his only [[Oscar award|Oscar]] nomination.<ref name="axmaker robinson crusoe" />

At one point during the filming, Buñuel asked Philipe, who was visibly dying of cancer, why the actor was making this film, and Philipe responded by asking the director the same question, to which both said they didn't know.<ref name=hagopian>{{cite web|last1=Hagopian|first1=Kevin|title=Fever Mounts in El Pao|url=http://www.albany.edu/writers-inst/webpages4/filmnotes/fnf02n11.html|website=New York State Writers Institute|publisher=Writers Institute|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>]]
In the mid-1950s, Buñuel got the chance to work again in France on international co-productions.  The result was what critic [[Raymond Durgnat]] has called the director's "revolutionary triptych", in that each of the three films is "openly, or by implication, a study in the morality and tactics of armed revolution against a right-wing dictatorship."<ref name=durgnat />{{rp|p.100}}  The first, ''[[Cela s'appelle l'aurore]]'' (Franco-Italian, 1956) required Buñuel and the [['Pataphysics|"pataphysical"]] writer [[Jean Ferry]] to adapt a novel by [[Emmanuel Roblès]] after the celebrated writer [[Jean Genet]] failed to deliver a script after having been paid in full.<ref name=aranda />{{rp|p.100}}  The second film was [[Death in the Garden|''La mort en ce jardin'']] (Franco-Mexican, 1956), which was adapted by Buñuel and his frequent collaborator [[Luis Alcoriza]] from a novel by the Belgian writer [[José-André Lacour]].  The final part of the "triptych" was ''[[La Fièvre Monte à El Pao]]'' (Franco-Mexican, 1959), the last film of the popular French star [[Gérard Philipe]], who died in the final stages of the production.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Canby|first1=Vincent|title=Film: From Bunuel, 'Los Ambiciosos,' at the Public|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/12/movies/film-from-bunuel-los-ambiciosos-at-the-public.html|accessdate=30 September 2014|agency=New York Times|date=12 February 1988}}</ref>  Buñuel was later to explain that he was so strapped for cash that he, "took everything that was offered to me, as long as it wasn’t humiliating."<ref name=hagopian />

In 1960, Buñuel re-teamed with scenarist Hugo Butler to make his second English-language film, a US/Mexico co-production called ''[[The Young One]]'', based on a short story by writer and former CIA-agent [[Peter Matthiessen]].  This film has been called "a surprisingly uncompromising study of racism and sexual desire, set on a remote island in the Deep South"<ref name="Buñuel's Mexico" /> and has been described by critic Ed Gonzalez as, "salacious enough to make [[Elia Kazan]]'s [[Baby Doll (1967 film)|''Baby Doll'']] and [[Louis Malle|Luis Malle's]] [[Pretty Baby (1978 film)|''Pretty Baby'']] blush."<ref name="The Young One 4 out of 4">{{cite web|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Ed|title=The Young One 4 out of 4|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-young-one|website=Slant Magazine|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>  Although the film won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival for its treatment of racial discrimination,<ref name=bentley />{{rp|p.151}} the US critics were so hostile upon its release that Buñuel was later to say that, "a Harlem newspaper even wrote that I should be hung upside down from a lamppost on Fifth Avenue….I made this film with love, but it never had a chance."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosenbaum|first1=Jonathan|title=The Young One: Buñuel’s Neglected Masterpiece|url=http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2009/07/22909/|website=jonathanrosenbaum.net|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>  In the words of film historian Peter Harcourt: "if ''The Young One'' must still be considered a 'bad' film by conventional standards, then it is one of the most subtle, most challenging and most distinguished bad films ever made."<ref name="peter harcourt">{{cite journal|last1=Harcourt|first1=Peter|title=Luis Buñuel: Spaniard and Surrealist|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1967|volume=20|issue=3|page=12|url=http://www.austinlibrary.com:2138/stable/pdfplus/1210106.pdf?&acceptTC=true&jpdConfirm=true|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref>

===Late international period (1961-1977)===
At the 1960 Cannes Festival, Buñuel was approached by the young director [[Carlos Saura]], whose film [[The Delinquents (1960 film)|''Los Golfos'']] had been entered officially to represent Spain,<ref>{{cite web|title=Los Golfos|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3299/year/1960.html|publisher=Festival de Cannes|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>  Two years earlier, Saura had partnered with [[Juan Antonio Bardem]] and [[Luis García Berlanga]] to form a production company called UNINCI,<ref name="andrew whittaker">{{cite book|last1=Whittaker|first1=Andrew|title=Speak the Culture: Spain: Be Fluent in Spanish Life and Culture|date=2008|publisher=Thorogood Publishing|location=London|isbn=1854186051|page=225|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2rZS8SWMroUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref> and the group was keen to get Buñuel to make a new film in his native country as part of their overall goal of creating a uniquely Spanish brand of cinema.<ref name=aranda />{{rp|p.190–91}} At the same time, Mexican actress [[Silvia Pinal]] was eager to work with Buñuel and talked her producer-husband [[Gustavo Alatriste]] into providing additional funding for the project with the understanding that the director, who Pinal described as "a man worshiped and idolized", would be given "absolute freedom" in carrying out the work.<ref name="agustin de gracia">{{cite news|last1=de Gracia|first1=Agustín|title=Recuerdan a Luis Buñuel a 30 años de su fallecimiento|url=http://www.laopinion.com/entretenimientocine/article/20130731/Recuerdan-a-Luis-Bunuel-a-30-anos-de-su-fallecimiento&template=print|accessdate=4 October 2014|work=laopinion.com|date=31 July 2013}}</ref> Finally, Buñuel agreed to work again in Spain when further support was provided by producer [[Pere Portabella]]'s company ''Film 59''.<ref name="pere portabella">{{cite web|title=Pere Portabella|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/films/556|website=Film Exhibitions|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=4 October 2014}}</ref>

Buñuel went on to make two more films in Mexico with Pinal and Alatriste, ''[[El angel exterminador]]'' (1962) and ''[[Simón del desierto]]'' (1965)— along with ''Viridiana'', they form the so-called "Buñuelian trilogy" — and was later to say that Alatriste had been the one producer who gave him the most freedom in creative expression.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Alfaro|first1=Eduardo de la Vega|title="The Decline of the Golden Age and the Making of the Crisis," in Mexico's Cinema: A Century of Film and Filmmakers, edited by Joanne Hershfield and David R.

After finishing ''Viridiana'', Buñuel had wanted to make a film of [[Benito Pérez Galdós]]' novel ''[[Tristana (novel)|Tristana]]'', a project he had envisioned as early as 1952, even though he considered Galdós' book the author's weakest, in Buñuel's words: "of the 'I love you, my little pigeon' genre, very kitsch".<ref name=fujiwara>{{cite web|last1=Fujiwara|first1=Chris|title=Tristana|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=628630%7C449958&name=Tristana|website=TCM Summer Under the Stars|publisher=Turner Entertainment Network|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> In 1962, the Spanish censor flatly turned down this project, in the wake of the scandal caused by the release of ''Viridiana'',<ref name=durgnat />{{rp|p.152}} and Buñuel had to wait for 10 years before he could receive backing from the Spanish production company Epoca Films.<ref name=fujiwara /> The censors had threatened to deny permission for the film on the grounds that it encouraged duelling, so Buñuel had to approach the subject matter very gingerly, in addition to making concessions to his French/Italian/Spanish producers, who insisted on casting two of the three primary roles with actors not of Buñuel's choosing: [[Franco Nero]] and Catherine Deneuve.<ref name="faulkner literary adaptations" />{{rp|p.128}} On this occasion, however, Deneuve and Buñuel had a more mutually satisfactory working relationship, with Deneuve telling an interviewer, "but in the end, you know, it was actually rather a wonderful shoot.

It has been considered by scholar Beth Miller the least understood of Buñuel's films, and consequently one of the most underrated, due to a "consistent failure to apprehend its political and, especially, its socialist-feminist statement".<ref name="beth miller">{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Beth|title="From Mistress to Murderess," in Women in Hispanic Literature: Icons and Fallen Idols, edited by Beth Kurti Miller|date=1983|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520043677|pages=340–41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cCIcUaEznYC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref>

One evening, Buñuel and Serge Silberman were discussing uncanny repetition in everyday life when Silberman told an anecdote about how he had invited some friends for dinner at his house, only to forget about it, so that, on the night of the dinner party, he was absent and his wife was in her nightclothes.<ref name=pinkos>{{cite web|last1=Pinkos|first1=Jefferey|title=Dinner Is Served|url=http://lonestarfilmsociety.com/discreet-charm-of-the-bourgeoisie/|website=Lone Star Film Society|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> This became the germ of the idea for their next film together, ''[[The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie]]'', which tells of a group of affluent friends who are continually stymied in their attempts to eat a meal together, a situation that a number of critics have contrasted to the opposite dilemma of the characters in ''The Exterminating Angel'', where guests of a dinner party are mysteriously unable to leave after having completed their meal.<ref name=lim /> For this film, Buñuel, Silberman and Carrière assembled a top-flight cast of European performers, "a veritable rogues' gallery of French art-house cinema", according to one critic.<ref name="budd wilkins">{{cite web|last1=Wilkins|first1=Budd|title=The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-discreet-charm-of-the-bourgeoisie-6699|website=Slant Magazine|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> For the first time, Buñuel made use of a [[video monitors|video-playback monitor]], which allowed him to make much more extensive use of [[crane shot]]s and elaborate [[tracking shot]]s, and enabled him to cut the film in the camera and eliminate the need for [[Re-shoot|reshoots]].<ref name=pinkos /> Filming required only two months and Buñuel claimed that editing took only one day.<ref name=pinkos /> When the film was released, Silberman decided to skip the Cannes Festival in order to concentrate on getting it nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], which it won, leading Buñuel to express his contempt for a process that relied on the judgment of, “2500 idiots, including for example the assistant dress designer of the studio.”<ref name=pinkos />

[[File:Fernando-rey.jpg|thumb|Fernando-rey|thumb|left|Spanish actor [[Fernando Rey]] appeared in four of Buñuel's films, including his final film, ''[[That Obscure Object of Desire]]''.

As was his habit, Buñuel took advantage of the popular success of ''Discreet Charm'' to make one of the "puzzling, idiosyncratic films he ''really'' wanted to make".<ref name="Polizzotti milky way" /> In 1973, at the [[Monastery of El Paular|Monastery of Paular]] in the Spanish [[Somosierra]], he wrote the screenplay for ''[[The Phantom of Liberty]]'' with Carrière for production by Silberman and his Hollywood partners.<ref name=aranda />{{rp|p.249}} The resulting film is a series of 12 distinctive episodes with separate protagonists, linked together only by following a character from one episode to another in a relay-race manner.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lanzagorta|first1=Marco|title=The Phantom of Liberty|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2002/cteq/phantom/|website=Senses of Cinema|publisher=Film Victoria, Australia|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref> Buñuel has stated that he made the film as a tribute to poet [[Benjamin Péret]], a founding member of French Surrealism,<ref name="bill krohn" />{{rp|p.170}} and called it his "most Surrealist film".<ref name=aranda />{{rp|p.249}}

Buñuel's final film was ''[[That Obscure Object of Desire]]'' (1977), adapted by Buñuel and Carrière from an 1898 novel by [[Pierre Louÿs]] called ''[[La Femme et le pantin]]'', which had already been used as the basis of films directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]] ([[The Devil is a Woman (1935 film)|''The Devil is a Woman'']], 1935) and [[Julien Duvivier]] (''[[La Femme et le Pantin]]'', 1959). The film, which tells the story of an older man who is obsessed by a young woman who continually evades his attempts to consummate a sexual relationship, starred the Spanish actor [[Fernando Rey]], appearing in his fourth Buñuel film. Initially, the part of the young woman was to be played by [[Maria Schneider (actress)|Maria Schneider]], who had achieved international fame for her roles in ''[[Last Tango in Paris]]'' and [[The Passenger (1975 film)|''The Passenger'']],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Grimes|first1=William|title=Maria Schneider, Actress in ‘Last Tango,’ Dies at 58|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/04/movies/04schneider.html?_r=0|accessdate=16 December 2014|work=New York Times|date=4 February 2011}}</ref> but once shooting started, according to Carrière, her drug usage resulted in a "lackluster and dull" performance that caused tempestuous arguments with Buñuel on the set and her eventual dismissal.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=David|title=David Thomson on Films: Remembering Maria Schneider|journal=New Republic|date=8 February 2011|url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/books-and-arts/82975/david-thomson-films-remembering-maria-schneider|accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref> Serge Silberman, the producer, decided to abandon the project at that point, but was convinced by Buñuel to continue shooting with two different actresses, [[Angela Molina]] and [[Carole Bouquet]] playing the same role in alternating sequences throughout the film. In his autobiography, Buñuel claimed that this unusual casting decision was his own idea after drinking two dry martinis, saying: "If I had to list all the benefits derived from alcohol, it would be endless".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pinkos|first1=Jefferey|title=Buñuel’s Pursuit of That Obscure Objecgt|url=http://lonestarfilmsociety.com/that-obscure-object-of-desire/|website=Lone Star Film Society|accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref> Others, however, have reported that Carrière had first broached the idea while developing the film's scenario, but had been brushed off by Buñuel as "the whim of a rainy day."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Ed|title=That Obscure Object of Desire|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/that-obscure-object-of-desire|website=Slant Magazine|accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref>

After the release of ''[[That Obscure Object of Desire]]'', Buñuel retired from filmmaking. In 1982, he wrote (along with Carrière) his autobiography, ''Mon Dernier Soupir'' (''My Last Sigh''), which provides an account of his life, friends, and family as well as a representation of his eccentric personality. In it, he recounts dreams, encounters with many well-known writers, actors, and artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]] as well as antics, like dressing up as a nun and walking around town.

In his 70's, Buñuel once told his friend, novelist [[Carlos Fuentes]]: “I’m not afraid of death. I’m afraid of dying alone in a hotel room, with my bags open and a shooting script on the night table.

==Influences==

===Surrealism===
[[File:BenjaminPéret.jpg|thumb|left|Buñuel considered [[Benjamin Péret]], a long-time friend, the "quintessential surrealist poet."<ref name="my last sigh" />{{rp|p.110}}]]
When his first film was released, Buñuel became the first filmmaker to be officially welcomed into the ranks of the Surrealists by the movement's leader [[André Breton]], an event recalled by film historian [[Georges Sadoul]]:  "Breton had convoked the creators to our usual venue [the Café  Radio]... one summer's evening. Dalí had the large eyes, grace, and timidity of a gazelle.  To us, Buñuel, big and athletic, his black eyes protruding a little, seemed exactly like he always is in ''Un Chien Andalou'', meticulously honing the razor that will slice the open eye in two."<ref name="sadoul mon ami bunuel">{{cite journal|last=Sadoul|first=Georges|title=Mon ami Buñuel|journal=L´écran française|date=12–18 December 1951|volume=no. 335|pages=12}}</ref> After he joined the Communist Party in Spain, however, it was quickly made clear to him that he could not be both a Communist and a Surrealist; his artistic collaborator Pierre Unik recounted in a letter of 30 January 1932 that "a comrade from Agit-Prop" called Buñuel and others together to tell them that, "Surrealism was a movement of bourgeois degeneration", continuing, "What will the rank-and-file comrades say the day I have to announce to them, 'Comrades, I no longer have the right to militate amongst you...because I'm a degenerate bourgeois?'"<ref name=gubern />{{rp|p.97}}  In consequence, on 6 May 1932, Buñuel wrote a letter to [[André Breton]] renouncing his membership in the Surrealist group: "Given the current state of things there could be no question for a Communist of doubting for an instant between the choice of his party and any other sort of activity or discipline".<ref name="hammond rouge">{{cite web|last=Hammond|first=Paul|title=Buñuel Bows Out|url=http://www.rouge.com.au/3/bunuel.html|publisher=Rouge|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> He even went so far as to try to re-issue a drastically cut version of ''L'Age d'Or'' (over two-thirds of the original were eliminated) in response to complaints that the full 60-minute original was formally too difficult for the [[proletariat]].<ref name=gubern />{{rp|p.138}} Nonetheless, he retained a lifelong affinity with the Surrealist movement and longstanding friendships with many of the most prominent Surrealists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gazetas|first1=Aristides|title=An Introduction to World Cinema, 2d ed.|date=2000|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0786439076|page=190|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YE4IAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=15 December 2014}}</ref>

Buñuel's films were famous for their [[surrealism|surreal imagery]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Linda|title="The Critical Grasp: Bunuelian Cinema and Its Critics", in Dada and Surrealist Film, ed. by Rudolf E.

An example of a more [[Dada]] influence can be found in ''[[Cet obscur objet du désir]]'', when Mathieu closes his eyes and has his valet spin him around and direct him to a map on the wall.<ref name=munjal />

Buñuel never explained or promoted his work, remaining true to his and Dalí's early insistence on the completely irrational and defying symbolic interpretation.<ref name=davies-stofka>{{cite book|last=Davies-Stofka|first=Beth|title="Luis Buñuel", in Encyclopedia of Religion and Film, ed. by Eric Michael Mazur|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara CA|isbn=978-0-313-33072-8|pages=99|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JPNfox6H5qwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>  On one occasion, when his son was interviewed about ''[[The Exterminating Angel (film)|The Exterminating Angel]]'', Buñuel instructed him to give facetious answers.<ref name="tcm exterminating" />  As examples, when asked about the presence of a bear in the socialites' house, Buñuel ''fils'' claimed it was because his father liked bears, and, similarly, the several repeated scenes in the film were explained as having been put there to increase the running time.<ref name="tcm exterminating">{{cite web|last=Stafford|first=Jeff|title=The Exterminating Angel|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/93550%7C0/The-Exterminating-Angel.html|work=Turner Classic Movies Film Article|publisher=Turner Entertainment Networks|accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>

===Entomology===
As a university student, Buñuel had studied entomology at the [[Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales|Museum of Natural History]] under the famous naturalist [[Ignacio Bolívar]],<ref name=edwards />{{rp|pp.65}} and he had an early and lasting interest in the scientific documentaries of [[Jean Painlevé]], which he tried to screen at the Residencia de Estudiantes.<ref name=gubern />{{rp|pp.168}} Numerous critics have commented on the number of sequences in his films involving insects, from the death's head moth in ''Un chien andalou'' and the extended scorpion scenes in ''L'Age d'or'' to the framed tarantula in ''Le Fantôme de la liberté''.<ref name="paul begin">{{cite journal|last1=Begin|first1=Paul|title=Entomology as anthropology in the films of Luis Buñuel|journal=Screen|date=2007|volume=40|issue=4|pages=425–442}}</ref> Others have commented on the dispassionate nature of Buñuel's treatment of his characters, likening it to the stance of the entomological researcher,<ref name=Russell /> and Buñuel himself once said that he had an "entomological" interest in the protagonist of his film ''El''.<ref name=durgnat />{{rp|pp.12}}  The writer [[Henry Miller]] observed: “Buñuel, like an entomologist, has studied what we call love in order to expose beneath the ideology, mythology, platitudes and phraseologies the complete and bloody machinery of sex.”<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Henry|title=The Cosmological Eye|date=1961|publisher=New Directions|location=New York|isbn=0811201104|page=57}}</ref>

===Religion and atheism===
Many of his films were openly critical of bourgeois [[morality|morals]] and [[religion|organized religion]], mocking the Roman Catholic Church in particular but religion in general, for its hypocrisy.<ref name=ali>{{cite web|last=Ali|first=Murtaza|title=Viridiana (1961): Luis Bunuel's Case Study on Bourgeoisie Plight and its Underlining Causes|url=http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/2012/02/viridiana-1961-luis-bunuels-case-study.html|publisher=A Potpourri of Vestiges|accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>  When asked if it was intention to blaspheme in his films, Buñuel responded, “I didn’t deliberately set out to be blasphemous, but then Pope John XXIII is a better judge of such things than I am.”<ref name="michael wood">{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Michael|title=Viridiana: The Human Comedy|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/423-viridiana-the-human-comedy|publisher=Criterion Collection|accessdate=28 September 2013}}</ref>   Many of his most famous films demonstrate this irreverent spirit:
[[Image:Cabeza de Luis Buñuel.JPG|thumb|200px|Head of Luis Buñuel in Centro Buñuel Calanda.]]
* ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (1929)&nbsp;– A man drags pianos, upon which are piled two dead donkeys, two priests, and the tablets of [[The Ten Commandments]].
* ''[[L'Âge d'Or]]'' (1930)&nbsp;–  A [[bishop]] is thrown out a window, and in the final scene one of the culprits of the ''[[120 days of Sodom]]'' is portrayed by an actor dressed in a way that he would be recognized as Jesus.
* ''[[El Gran Calavera]]'' (1949)&nbsp;– During the final scenes of the wedding, the priest continuously reminds the bride of her obligations under marriage. Then the movie changes and the bride runs chasing her true love.
* ''[[Ensayo de un crimen]]'' (1955)&nbsp;–  A man dreams of murdering his wife while she's praying in bed dressed all in white.

Buñuel is often cited as one of the world's most prominent [[Atheism|atheists]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Religious Affiliation of Director Luis Bunuel|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pb/Luis_Bunuel.html|publisher=Adherents.com|accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>  In a 1960 interview, he was asked about his attitude toward religion, and his response has become one of his most celebrated quotes:  “I’m still an atheist, thank God.”<ref name=manceaux>{{cite journal|last=Manceaux|first=Michèle|title=Luis Buñuel: athée grâce à Dieu|journal=L’Express|date=12 May 1960|pages=41}}</ref>  But his entire answer to the question was somewhat more nuanced:  "I have no attitude.

Seventeen years later, in an interview with the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'', Buñuel expressed a somewhat different opinion about religion and atheism: "I’m not a Christian, but I’m not an atheist either, ... I'm weary of hearing that accidental old aphorism of mine, 'I'm not an atheist, thank God.' It’s outworn. Dead leaves. In 1951, I made a small film called 'Mexican Bus Ride', about a village too poor to support a church and a priest. The place was serene, because no one suffered from guilt.

[[File:SilviaPinalStatue.JPG|thumb|left|Silvia Pinal was one of Buñuel's "stock company" of actors and was his preferred choice for the lead in his film ''[[Tristana]]'', a part which finally went to [[Catherine Deneuve]]<ref name="faulkner literary adaptations">{{cite book|last1=Faulkner|first1=Sally|title=Literary Adaptations in Spanish Cinema|date=2004|publisher=Tamesis|location=London|isbn=1855660989|page=128|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yeMgJsea3-8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> ]]
Buñuel's style of directing was extremely economical; he shot films in a few weeks, rarely deviating from his script (the scene in ''[[Tristana]]'' where [[Catherine Deneuve]] exposes her breasts to Saturno – but not the audience – being a noted exception) and shooting in order as much as possible to minimize editing time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Sean|title="Luis Buñuel", in The Scarecrow Video Movie Guide|year=2004|publisher=Sasquatch Books|location=Seattle WA|isbn=1-57061-415-6|pages=31|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0qiQLs-6SocC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>   He remained true throughout his working life to an operating philosophy that he articulated at the beginning of his career in 1928:  "The guiding idea, the silent procession of images that are concrete, decisive, measured in space and time—in a word, the film—was first projected inside the brain of the filmmaker".<ref name="an unspeakable betrayal" />{{rp|p.135}}  In this, Buñuel has been compared with [[Alfred Hitchcock]], another director famous for precision, efficiency and preplanning, for whom actually shooting the film was an anticlimax, since each man would know, in Buñuel's words, "exactly how each scene will be shot and what the final montage will be".<ref>{{cite book|last=Stam|first=Robert|title="Hitchock and Buñuel: Authority, Desire and the Absurd", in Hitchcock's Rereleased Films: From Rope to Vertigo, ed. by Walter Raubicheck and Walter Srebnick|year=1991|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=0-8143-2326-X|pages=117|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CfVeQ5BaPVsC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>  According to actress [[Jeanne Moreau]]:  "He was the only director I know who never threw away a shot.

As much as possible, Buñuel preferred to work with actors and crew members with whom he had worked before and whom he trusted, leading some critics to refer to these people as a [[Stock company (acting)|"stock company"]], including such performers as: [[Fernando Rey]], [[Francisco Rabal]], [[Pierre Clementi]], [[Julien Bertheau]], [[Michel Piccoli]], [[Claudio Brook]], [[Silvia Pinal]], [[Paul Frankeur]] and [[Georges Marchal]].<ref name=Russell />  In his final film, ''That Obscure Object of Desire'', the central character was played by Rey, but voiced by the French-speaking Piccoli.<ref name=Russell /> He told actors as little as possible, and limited his directions mostly to physical movements ("move to the right", "walk down the hall and go through that door", etc.),<ref name="The Bunuel mystery">{{cite web|last=Carriere|first=Jean-Claude|title=The Bunuel mystery|url=http://www.maryellenmark.com/text/magazines/show/921W-000-002.html|publisher=maryellenmark.com|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref>  arguing that he had a better chance of capturing reality with inexperienced players who projected a desired sense of awkwardness.<ref name="zachary scott">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Ronald L.|title=Zachary Scott: Hollywood's Sophisticated Cad|year=2006|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson MS|isbn=978-1-57806-837-1|pages=184|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Yx-NGyX88O4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>  He often refused to answer actors' questions and was known to simply turn off his hearing aid on the set.<ref>{{cite book|last=Isaac|first=Claudio|title=Midday with Buñuel: memories and sketches, 1973–1983|year=2008|publisher=Swan Isle Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-9748881-3-2|pages=37}}</ref>  One of his stars, Catherine Deneuve, has stated: "I've always thought that he likes actors, up to a point. I think he likes very much the idea of the film, and to write it. But I had the impression that the film-making was not what he preferred to do. He had to go through actors, and he liked them if they were easy, simple, not too much fuss."<ref name="belle de jour tcm">{{cite web|last=Landazuri|first=Margarita|title=Belle de jour|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?id=628630%7C636738|website=TCM Classic Movies|publisher=Turner Entertainment Networks|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref> Though they found it difficult at the time, many actors who worked with him acknowledged later that his approach made for fresh and excellent performances.<ref name="zachary scott" />

Buñuel preferred scenes that could simply be pieced together end-to-end in the editing room, resulting in long, mobile, wide shots which followed the action of the scene.  Filmmaker Patricia Gruben has attributed this procedure to a long-standing strategy on Buñuel's part intended to thwart external interference:  "he would make the whole scene in long four-minute dolly shots so the producers couldn’t cut it".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoolboom|first=Mike|title=Inside the pleasure dome: fringe ﬁlm in Canada|year=2001|publisher=Coach House Books|location=Toronto|isbn=1-55245-099-6|pages=42|url=http://www.mikehoolboom.com/r2/docs/722.pdf}}</ref>  Examples are especially present in his French films. For example, at the ski resort's restaurant in ''[[Belle de jour (film)|Belle de jour]]'', Séverin, Pierre, and Henri converse at a table. Buñuel cuts away from their conversation to two young women, who walk down a few steps and proceed through the restaurant, passing behind Séverin, Pierre, and Henri, at which point the camera stops and the young women walk out of frame. Henri then comments on the women and the conversation at the table progresses from there.

===Mise-en-scène===
[[File:GabrielFigueroa.jpg|right|thumb|110p|Cinematogrpher Gabriel Figueroa was Buñuel's favorite cameraman, making seven films together and remaining close friends until the director's death.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tuckman|first1=Jo|title=The man who captured shadows|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/oct/26/2|accessdate=21 September 2014|work=The Guardian|agency=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=25 October 2007}}</ref>]]
Critics have remarked on Buñuel's predilection for developing a surrealist [[mise-en-scène]] through use of a deceptively sparse naturalism,<ref>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Thomas Allen|title=Kubrick, Inside a Film Artist's Maze|year=2000|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=0-253-33742-9|pages=64|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wabgZNgT9OgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> as Michael Atkinson has put it: "visually Spartan and yet spasming with bouts of the irrational."<ref>{{cite web|last=Atkinson|first=Michael|title=Diary of a Chambermaid|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/116-diary-of-a-chambermaid|publisher=Criterion Collection|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> Buñuel's visual style has been generally characterized as highly functional and uncluttered, with extraneous detail eliminated on sets to focus on character-defining elements.<ref>{{cite web|last=Axmaker|first=Sean|title=Catherine Deneuve in Luis Bunuel's Belle De Jour|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/movie-news.html?id=455358&name=Belle-De-Jour|work=TCM Archive|publisher=Turner Entertainment Network|accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref>

As an example, Buñuel has told about one of his experiences with cameraman [[Gabriel Figueroa]], a veteran who had become famous in cinematography circles by making a specialty of illuminating the beauty of the Mexican landscape using photographic [[chiaroscuro]] (stark contrast between illuminated space and dark shadows).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mexico of Emilio Fernández and Gabriel Figueroa|url=http://cinelasamericas.org/special-events/206-the-mexico-of-emilio-fernandez-and-gabriel-figueroa|publisher=Cine Las Americas|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref>  Figueroa had set up a shot for ''Nazarín'' near the valley of the [[Popocatépetl]]: "It was during this shoot that I scandalized Gabriel Figueroa, who had prepared for me an aesthetically irreproachable framing, with the Popocatépetl in the background and the inevitable white clouds. I simply turned the camera to frame a banal scene that seemed to me more real, more proximate. I have never liked refabricated cinematographic beauty, which very often makes one forget what the film wants to tell, and which personally, does not move me."<ref>{{cite book|last=Acevedo-Muñoz|first=Ernesto R.|title=Los olvidados: Luis Buñuel and the Crisis of Nationalism|year=1997|publisher=Latin American Studies Association|location=Guadalajara|pages=4|url=http://biblioteca.clacso.edu.ar/ar/libros/lasa97/acevedomunoz.pdf}}</ref>

Actress [[Catherine Deneuve]] has provided another anecdote illustrating this aspect of Buñuel's style: while shooting ''Tristana'', he had told her frequently of the distaste he felt for the "touristy" side of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], where the film was made, so she teased him about one [[crane shot]] that brought out the beauty of the surrounding landscape, to which Buñuel responded by re-shooting the entire scene from a dolly with no background whatsoever, all the while inveighing against the "obviously" beautiful.<ref>{{cite book|last=Deneuve|first=Catherine|title=The Private Diaries of Catherine Deneuve: Close Up and Personal|year=2007|publisher=Pegasus Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-933648-36-1|pages=95}}</ref>

===Sound===
Buñuel has been hailed as a pioneer of the sound film, with ''L'Age d'Or'' being cited as one of the first innovative uses of sound in French film.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Rashna Wadia|title=Unsynched: The Contrapuntal Sounds of Luis Bunuel's L'Age d'Or|journal=Film Criticism|date=Winter 2008|volume=33|issue=2|pages=23–43}}</ref>  Film scholar Linda Williams has pointed out that Buñuel used sounds, including music, as nonsynchronous counterpoint to the visual image, rather than redundant accompaniment,<ref name="linda williams">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Linda|title=Figures of Desire: A Theory and Analysis of Surrealist Film|year=1981|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=0-520-07896-9|pages=106–107|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MxxWYcKv488C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> in accordance with theories that had been advanced by Sergei Eisenstein and others in a 1928 manifesto on the sound film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eisenstein|first=Sergei|title=Film Form: Essays in Film Theory|year=1949|publisher=Harcourt Brace|location=New York|isbn=0-15-630920-3|pages=257–260}}</ref>  Critic Marsha Kinder has posited that Buñuel's years as a film dubber in Europe and Hollywood put him in the position of “mastering the conventions of film sound, to subvert them more effectively”.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kinder|first=Marsha|title=Blood Cinema: The Reconstruction of National Identity in Spain|year=1993|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-08157-4|pages=294}}</ref>  In his later years, Buñuel was almost completely deaf, but he continued to assert control over the sound effects in his films, such as ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'', in which seemingly important speech, especially political discourse, is often drowned out by the noise of urban life, in such a systematic manner that Kinder has identified Buñuel as one of the first professional [[sound design]]ers in cinema.<ref name="kinder discreet">{{cite book|last1=Kinder|first1=Marsha|title=Buñuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0521568315|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vgAWhasEncC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref> As further illustration of this, scholar Sally Faulkner has described the means by which, in his film ''Tristana'',  Buñuel "engineers a kind of figurative deafness, or disability, in the spectator" in scenes which involve deaf characters, by, for example, combining the sound of gushing water with an image of a stagnant pool, or exaggerating the volume level of chiming bells.<ref name="sally faulkner">{{cite book|last=Faulkner|first=Sally|title=Literary Adaptations in Spanish Cinema|year=2004|publisher=Tamesis|location=London|isbn=1-85566-098-9|pages=152–153|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fWOwfr0LWYoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>

===Music===
Music is an important part of Buñuel's early films, to such an extent that, for his one silent film ''Un Chien Andalou'', in his sixties, he took the trouble to create a sonorised version, based on the music ([[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], a South American tango) played at its original screening.<ref name="un chien senses of cinema">{{cite web|title=Un Chien Andalou|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2001/cteq/chien/|work=Cinémathèque Annotations on Film, Issue 12|publisher=Senses of Cinema|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref>  One critic has noted that, in ''L'Age d'Or'', Buñuel employed the music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and Wagner "as a kind of connective tissue for, and aural commentary on, the unnerving visuals."<ref name=higgins>{{cite book|last=Higgins|first=Steven|title=Still Moving: The Film and Media Collections of the Museum of Modern Art|year=2006|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|location=New York|isbn=0-87070-326-9|pages=151}}</ref>  As regards ''Las Hurdes'', critics have often remarked on the "nagging inappropriateness"<ref name=ruoff>{{cite journal|last=Ruoff|first=Jeffrey|title=An Ethnographic Surrealist Film: Luis Buñuel's Land Without Bread|journal=Visual Anthropology Review|date=Spring–Summer 1998|volume=14|issue=1|pages=52|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jruoff/Articles/EthnographicSurrealist.htm|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> of the score, the fourth movement of [[Johannes Brahms]]' [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 4 in E Minor]], a practice called by James Clifford "fortuitous or ironic collage."<ref name=clifford>{{cite book|last=Clifford|first=James|title=The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth Century Ethnography, Literature, and Art.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-69843-7|pages=132}}</ref>  Although Buñuel's use of this technique declined in frequency over the years, he still occasionally employed incongruous musical juxtaposition for ironic effect, notably during the opening and the climactic scenes of [[Viridiana]], which take place to the strains of [[Handel]]'s [[Hallelujah Chorus]],<ref name=coates>{{cite book|last=Coates|first=Paul|title=Cinema, Religion, and the Romantic Legacy|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate|location=Burlington, VT|isbn=978-0-7546-1585-9|pages=191–192|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qVLTl6GQ4CoC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=viridiana+hallelujah+bunuel+ironic&source=bl&ots=0I8ElM_YLC&sig=vZU0LYpWuNEQXHysHsxBYu3vFTQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BHQQULqVBYeI8QT65ICAAg&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=viridiana%20hallelujah%20bunuel%20ironic&f=false}}</ref> in pointed contrast to the jazz music played during the film's final scene of the card game.<ref name=Pavlovi>{{cite book|last=Pavlović|first=Tatjana et al.|title=100 Years of Spanish Cinema|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=1-4051-8419-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PtFXpxyWMi4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>{{rp|pp.100–101}}

Late in life, Buñuel claimed to dislike [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] music (music not intrinsic to the scene itself) and avoided its use, stating: “In my last films I rarely use music. If I do, it has to be justified, so the viewer can see its source: a gramophone or a piano."<ref name=kanaya>{{cite book|last=Kanaya|first=S.|title=Luis Buñuel|year=2007|publisher=Kinokuniya|location=Tokyo|pages=12–29}}</ref>  One consistent exception, however, is the use of the traditional drums from his birthplace Calanda, which are heard in most of his films, with such regularity that the repetition has been described as a “biofilmographic signature”.<ref name="d'lugo">{{cite book|last=D’Lugo|first=Marvin|title="Buñuel in the Cathedral of Culture" in Marsha Kinder (ed.), Luis Buñuel’s The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, New York|isbn=978-0-521-56831-9|pages=108}}</ref> Buñuel's explanation of his use of these drums was the statement:  "Nowhere are they beaten with such mysterious power as in Calanda...in recognition of the shadows that covered the earth at the moment Christ died."<ref name="my last sigh" /> {{rp|p.19}}

The films of his second French era were not scored and some (''Belle de jour'', ''[[Diary of a Chambermaid (1964 film)|Diary of a Chambermaid]]'') are without music entirely. ''Belle de jour'' does, however, feature non-diegetic [[sound effects]], "to unify spatially incongruous shots or symbolize [the protagonist's] dream world."<ref name=munjal>{{cite web|last=Munjal|first=Savi|title=I'm Tired of Symmetry: The Destructive Rhythms of Bunuel's Bourgeois Trilogy|url=http://www.cerebration.org/symmetry.html|work=Cerebration|publisher=Caspersen School of graduate studies, Drew University|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref>
