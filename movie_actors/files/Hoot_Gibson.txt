'''Hoot Gibson''' (August 6, 1892 – August 23, 1962) was an American [[rodeo]] champion and a pioneer [[cowboy]] [[film]] [[actor]], [[Film director|director]] and  [[Film producer|producer]].

==Early life and career==
[[File:Winged Horseman lobby card.jpg|thumb|Lobby card for Gibson's 1929 film, ''The Winged Horseman'']]
Born '''Edmund Richard Gibson''' in [[Tekamah, Nebraska]], he learned to ride a horse while still a very young boy. His family moved to [[California]] when he was seven years old.  As a teenager he worked with horses on a ranch, which led to competition on [[bareback bronc|bucking broncos]] at area rodeos. Given the nickname "Hoot Owl" by co-workers, the name evolved to just "Hoot".

In 1910, film director [[Francis Boggs]] was looking for experienced cowboys to appear in his [[silent film]] [[short film|short]], ''[[Pride of the Range]]''. Gibson and another future star of [[Western film]]s, [[Tom Mix]], were hired. Gibson made a second film for Boggs in 1911.  After a deranged employee killed Boggs, director [[Jack Conway (filmmaker)|Jack Conway]] hired Gibson to appear in his 1912 Western, ''[[His Only Son]]''. {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Acting for Gibson was then a minor sideline, and he continued competing in rodeos to make a living. In 1912, he won the all-around championship at the famous [[Pendleton Round-Up]] in [[Pendleton, Oregon]] and the [[steer roping]] World Championship at the [[Calgary Stampede]].

Gibson's career was temporarily interrupted with service in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War I]] as a Sergeant in the [[Tank Corps, National Army|Tank Corps]].<ref>http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/timeline/gibson_hoot.htm</ref>  When the war ended, he returned to the rodeo business and became good friends with [[Art Acord]], a fellow cowboy and movie actor. The two participated in summer rodeo then went back to [[Hollywood]] for the winter to do stunt work. For several years, Gibson had secondary film roles (primarily in Westerns) with stars such as [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]].  By 1921, the demand for cowboy pictures was so great that Gibson began receiving offers for leading roles.  Some of these offers came from  up-and-coming film director [[John Ford]], with whom Gibson developed a lasting friendship and working relationship.

==Financial difficulties and later life==
From the 1920s through the 1940s, Hoot Gibson was a major film attraction, ranking second only to [[Tom Mix]] as a western film [[box office]] draw. He successfully made the transition to [[talkies]] and as a result became a highly paid performer. He appeared in his own [[comic books]] and was wildly popular until singing cowboys such as [[Gene Autry]] and [[Roy Rogers]] displaced him.

In 1927, actor Gibson, and five other California businessman sponsored ''The Spirit of Los Angeles'', a modification of the [[Catron & Fisk CF-10|International CF-10]] for an attempt at winning the [[Dole Air Race|Dole Air Derby]]. Gibson had his name painted on the nose for publicity. The aircraft crashed in the [[San Francisco Bay]] before the start of the race.<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Skyways|date=January 1999}}</ref>

In 1933, Gibson injured himself when he crashed his plane while racing cowboy star [[Ken Maynard]] in the [[National Air Races]].  Later, the two friends teamed up to make a series of low budget movies in the twilight of their careers.

Gibson's years of substantial earnings did not see him through his retirement.  He had squandered much of his income on high living and poor investments. By the 1950s, Gibson faced financial ruin, aided in part by costly medical bills from serious health problems.  To get by and pay his bills, he earned money as a greeter at a [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] [[casino]].  For a time, he worked in a [[carnival]] and took virtually any job his dwindling name value could obtain. This included an episode of Groucho's ''You Bet Your Life'', filmed in December 1955. He made the final game with his contestant but didn't win the big money, though he earned himself a share of the $440 prize money for the show.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs1NMuOuUJo&index=41&list=PLiysj-EKbPPqnbL63xLO5G27jkP0_Cr3P</ref>

==Personal life==
Hoot Gibson married [[Helen Gibson|Rose August Wenger]], a rodeo performer he had met at the [[Pendleton Round-Up]] in [[Oregon]] sometime between 1911 and 1913.  Under the name Helen Gibson, she became a major film star in her own right for a time, notably in the lead role of ''[[The Hazards of Helen]]'' [[adventure film]] [[Serial (film)|serial]].  Census records for 1920 indicate they were living separately; Hoot Gibson listed himself as married; Helen listed herself as widowed.<ref>1920 United States Census for Los Angeles, California, Sheets No. 19A and 10B</ref>

Following their separation/divorce, Gibson met a young woman named Helen Johnson, whom he married in either 1920 or 1922 and with whom he had one child, Lois Charlotte Gibson.  They divorced in 1930.  The fact that Hoot Gibson was married to two consecutive women who used the name Helen Gibson in some fashion has led to a good deal of confusion.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

After his divorce from Helen Johnson Gibson, Gibson had a brief marriage to film actress [[Sally Eilers]], which ended in 1933. Gibson married a final time, to Dorothy Dunstan, on July 3, 1942.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Death==
Hoot Gibson died of cancer in 1962 in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California]] and was interred in the [[Inglewood Park Cemetery]] in [[Inglewood, California]].<ref>{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Hoot Gibson, Film Cowboy, Dies.
