'''Albert Dekker''' (December 20, 1905 – May 5, 1968) was an American [[character actor]] and [[politician]] best known for his roles in ''[[Dr. Cyclops]]'', ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'', ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'', and ''[[The Wild Bunch]]''. He is sometimes credited as '''Albert Van Dekker''' or '''Albert van Dekker'''.

==Early life and career==
He was born '''Thomas Albert Ecke Van Dekker''' in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the only child of Thomas and Grace Ecke Van Dekker. He attended [[Richmond Hill High School (Queens, New York)|Richmond Hill High School]] where he appeared in stage productions. He then attended [[Bowdoin College]] where he majored in [[pre-med]] with plans to become a doctor. On the advice of a friend, he decided to pursue acting as a career instead. He and made his professional acting debut with a [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] stock company in 1927. Within a few months, Dekker was featured in the [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] production of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s play ''Marco Millions''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burroughs Hannsberry|first=Karen |title=Bad Boys: The Actors of Film Noir|year=2003|publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=0-786-41484-7|page=192}}</ref>

[[File:Dekkercyclops.jpg|left|140px|thumb|Dekker as Dr. Alexander Thorkel in the [[1940 in film|1940]] film ''[[Dr. Cyclops]]'']]

After a decade of theatrical appearances, Dekker transferred to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] in 1937, and made his first film, 1937's ''[[The Great Garrick]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Monush|first=Barry |title=Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the Silent Era to 1965|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=2003|pages=187|isbn=1-55783-551-9}}</ref> He spent most of the rest of his acting career in the cinema, but also returned to the stage from time to time.

He replaced [[Lee J. Cobb]] as [[Willy Loman]] in the original production of [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', and during a five-year stint back on Broadway in the early 1960s, he played the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] in [[Robert Bolt]]'s ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]''.

Dekker appeared in some seventy films from the 1930s to 1960s, but his four most famous screen roles were as a mad scientist in the [[1940 in film|1940]] horror film ''[[Dr. Cyclops]]'', as a vicious hitman in ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'', as a dangerous dealer in atomic fuel in the 1955 [[film noir]] ''[[Kiss Me Deadly]]'', and as an unscrupulous railroad detective in [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s Western ''[[The Wild Bunch]]''. In 1959 he played a convincing Texas Ranger Captain Rucker in ''[[The Wonderful Country]]''. He was rarely cast in romantic roles, but in the film ''[[Seven Sinners (1940 film)|Seven Sinners]]'', featuring a romance between [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[John Wayne]], Dietrich sails off with Dekker's character at the end of the film. Dekker's role as Pat Harrigan in ''The Wild Bunch'' would be his last screen appearance.

==Personal life==
On April 4, 1929, Dekker married former actress Esther Guerini. The couple had two sons, John and Benjamin, and a daughter, Jan, before divorcing in 1964.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7horAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fZ0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=5984,972608&dq=esther+guerini+albert+dekker&hl=en|title=Actor Divorced|date=February 19, 1964|work=Reading Eagle|page=42|accessdate=January 13, 2013}}</ref><ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|title=Actor's Son Shot Dead; John Dekker, 16, Found Slain in Westchester Home|date=April 19, 1957|work=The New York Times|page=15}}</ref>

In April 1957, Dekker's 16-year old son, John, shot himself with a [[.22 Long Rifle|.22 rifle]] at the family's [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York]] home. He had reportedly been working on a [[suppressor|silencer]] for the rifle for a year. His death was ruled accidental.<ref name="nytimes" />

===Politics===
Dekker's off-screen interest in politics led to his winning a seat in the [[California State Assembly]] for the 57th Assembly District in 1944. Dekker served as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member for the Assembly until 1946.<ref>{{cite news|title=Autopsy Performed on Actor Albert Dekker |date=May 7, 1968|work=The Los Angeles Times|page=19}}</ref>

During the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]] he was an outspoken critic of U.S. Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s tactics. As a result, Dekker was blacklisted in Hollywood and spent most of the blacklist period working on Broadway rather than Hollywood.<ref name=hare>{{cite book|last=Hare|first=William |title=L.A. Noir: Nine Dark Visions of the City of Angels|year=2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-43740-5|page=143}}</ref>

==Death==
On May 5, 1968, Dekker was found dead in his Hollywood home by his fiancée, Geraldine Saunders.  He was naked, kneeling in the bathtub, with a noose tightly wrapped around his neck and looped around the shower curtain rod.  He was blindfolded, his wrists were handcuffed, there was a ball gag in his mouth, and two hypodermic needles were inserted in one arm. His body was covered in explicit words and drawings in red lipstick.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gay Fireside Companion|last=Rutledge |first=Leigh W. |authorlink=Leigh W. Rutledge |year=1989 |publisher=Alyson Publications, Inc.|page=110}}</ref> Money and camera equipment were found missing, but there was no sign of forced entry.  Though speculation ran rampant, the coroner found no evidence of foul play, and ruled his death accidental due to [[autoerotic asphyxiation]].<ref name=hare /><ref name="hollywood">{{cite book|last=Parish|first=James Robert|title=The Hollywood Book of Death: The Bizarre, Often Sordid, Passings of More Than 125 American Movie and TV Idols|publisher=Contemporary Books|year=2002|pages=260|isbn=0-8092-2227-2}}</ref> Dekker was cremated, and his remains interred at the [[Garden State Crematory]] in [[North Bergen, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dekker's Death Accidental, Tentative Ruling Declares|date=May 9, 1968|work=The New York Times}}</ref>
