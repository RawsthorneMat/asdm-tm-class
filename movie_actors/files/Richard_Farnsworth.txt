'''Richard W. Farnsworth''' (September 1, 1920&nbsp;– October 6, 2000) was an American actor and [[stunt double|stuntman]]. His film career began in 1937; however, he achieved his greatest success for his performances in ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Straight Story]]'' (1999), for which he received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].

== Early life ==
Farnsworth was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to a housewife mother and an [[engineer]] father.<ref>{{cite web|author=An L.M Montgomery Resource Page |url=http://www.tickledorange.com/LMM/RichardFarnsworth.html |title=Richard Farnsworth |publisher=Tickledorange.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> He was raised during the [[Great Depression]]. He lived with his aunt, mother, and two sisters in downtown Los Angeles after his father died when he was seven years old.

== Career ==
He was working as a stable hand at a polo field in Los Angeles for six dollars a week when he was offered a chance to make seven dollars a day plus a box lunch as a stuntman. In 1937, when he was sixteen, he started by riding horses in films such as ''[[The Adventures of Marco Polo]]'' with [[Gary Cooper]]. He performed several horse-riding stunts in such films as the [[Marx Brothers]]' ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'' (1937) and ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' (1939). 

What differentiated Farnsworth from other western actors was his gradual transition into acting from stunt work. He made uncredited appearances in numerous films, including ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948), ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953), and ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956). He was on the set of ''[[Spartacus (movie)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) for eleven months. He laughed when he said he did not look like a [[gladiator]] but drove a chariot. However, it was not until 1963 that he finally received his first acting credit.

Farnsworth's acting career was largely in [[western film]]s, although he did appear in the 1977 television [[miniseries]] ''[[Roots (mini-series)|Roots]]'' and the short-lived but critically acclaimed 1992 summer replacement ''The Boys of Twilight''. He also appeared in television commercials. Farnsworth became well known in the Pacific Northwest for portraying the groundskeeper who saw the mythical "Artesians" in the 1980s [[Olympia Brewing Company|Olympia Beer]] ad campaign. In 1979, Farnsworth was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for ''[[Comes a Horseman]]''. However, his breakthrough came when he played [[stagecoach]] robber [[Bill Miner]] in the 1982 Canadian film ''[[The Grey Fox (film)|The Grey Fox]]'', for which he won a [[Genie Award]]. 

He appeared as a baseball coach in ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' in 1984, and won a [[Gemini Award]] for his performance as Matthew Cuthbert in the 1985 Canadian miniseries ''[[Anne of Green Gables (1985 film)|Anne of Green Gables]]''. Another of his prominent roles was as a suspicious sheriff in the film version of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' (1990), a character that was created exclusively for the movie.

In 1999, Farnsworth was nominated for an Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for ''[[The Straight Story]]''. When director [[David Lynch]] offered him the role, Farnsworth had no idea who he was. Farnsworth did not like violence or swearing, and Lynch assured him that there would be none of that in the movie. The lead role was a rarity for a man his age.

Farnsworth has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1560 Vine Street. In 1997, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].

Farnsworth was the spokesman for the Lincoln County Cowboy Symposium, an annual event in [[Ruidoso, New Mexico]]. He made a video with cowboy poet Waddie Mitchell called ''Buckaroo Bard''. He also helped with the 'Last Great Cattle Drive of This Millennium' in 1999. Shortly before his death, he was presented with an award from the [[Governor of New Mexico|Governor]] of [[New Mexico]] for Excellence and Achievement in the Arts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

== Personal life and death ==
Farnsworth was married to Margaret "Maggie" Hill (who died in 1985) for 38 years. They had two children, Diamond and Missy. He moved to [[Lincoln, New Mexico]], where he owned a {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} ranch and was involved in the community and was well-liked.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} 

Toward the end of his life, he met Jewely Van Valin, a stewardess 35 years his junior. Farnsworth and Van Valin started riding horses together, and later became engaged.{{fact|date=June 2014}} Farnsworth was diagnosed and treated for [[prostate cancer]] in the early 1990s. He was eventually diagnosed with terminal [[bone cancer]], which left him partially paralyzed and unable to walk. On October 6, 2000, Farnsworth committed [[suicide]] by shooting himself at his ranch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,618509,00.html|title=Richard Farnsworth: Suicide|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=July 16, 1998}}</ref>
