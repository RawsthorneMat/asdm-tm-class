At the age of 12, Hooper read a book entitled ''How to Make Film and Television'' and decided he wanted to become a director.<ref name="Brown"/><ref name=Hulse/> For the next year Hooper researched filmmaking from publications such as ''On Camera'' by Harris Watts.<ref name=Hulse/> Aged 13, he made his first film, entitled ''Runaway Dog'', using a clockwork 16mm [[Bolex]] camera his uncle had given to him.<ref name="Brown"/> Hooper said: "The clockwork would run out after thirty seconds, so the maximum shot length was thirty seconds. I could only afford a hundred feet of Kodachrome reversal film, which cost about twenty-five [pounds], and you had to send off for two weeks to be processed.

Hooper finished school aged 16, then wrote the script for his first professional short film, entitled ''Painted Faces''. He spent the next two years raising capital for the short by courting advertisement directors, whose financial dominance during the late 1980s was noticed by Hooper. Director [[Paul Weiland]] invested in the short, which provided Hooper with the equipment he needed. After two years of financing and production, ''Painted Faces'' was completed. Hooper wrote, produced, directed and edited it.<ref name=Hulse/> It was sold to [[Channel 4]] and broadcast on the channel's ''First Frame'' strand in 1992, had a screening at the 35th [[London Film Festival]] and had a limited theatrical release.<ref name="Brown">Brown, Maggie (16 October 2006).

Hooper returned to Granada the next year to direct the revival of ''[[Prime Suspect]]'', entitled ''The Last Witness''. The two-part serial was the first ''Prime Suspect'' instalment to be made since 1995, when star [[Helen Mirren]] quit.

Hooper made his debut as a feature film director with the South African [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] drama ''[[Red Dust (2004 film)|Red Dust]]'' (2004), which stars [[Hilary Swank]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] and [[Jamie Bartlett]]. The film was not widely seen, which Hooper attributed to media coverage of torture during the [[Iraq War]]: "When I started making it you could watch the movie with a wonderful sense of 'we'd never do it in our own country…they're the horrible people but it's not us.' By the time the film came out (there were) these revelations that the Americans were torturing, the British were torturing. The film became a lot more uncomfortable for the very audiences it was designed to target. I have learned that sadly the theatrical audience does not run to see films that are openly issue led."<ref name=Halper/> The premiere of the film in the United Kingdom came on [[BBC Two]] in 2005, making it eligible for the BAFTA Television Awards; it was nominated in the Best Single Drama category at the 2006 ceremony.<ref>"[http://www.bafta.org/awards/television/nominations/?year=2005 Television nominations 2005]".

<blockquote>Director Tom Hooper lets his actors shine, as he did so marvelously in Helen Mirren's ''Elizabeth I'' and the child-killer drama ''Longford'', but he complements them, too, with this kind of immediate point of view. And when he does give us panoramic shots from afar – of the Adams farm in Braintree, for example – they're askew, to keep us out of the classroom mode. At the end of episode 2 [...] Hooper showcases all his directorial strength with one bold choice. When the long-fretting Congress finally decides to break with Britain, he refrains from using any visual or aural tweaks. Upon the announcement, "The resolution carries," the scene remains perfectly silent for one long moment. The terror of responsibility hangs heavily in the room, while a victorious soundtrack surely would have chased it away.<ref>Gilbert, Matthew (14 March 2008).

Work on Hooper's next film, ''[[The King's Speech]]'', began in the same year.

Hooper told the ''Los Angeles Times'' that he thought there was a "slightly strange falseness" when he saw musical films where the actors sang to recordings.

Hooper believed this method allowed the actors to have emotional control over their songs: "When Annie [Hathaway, who plays Fantine] is singing 'I Dreamed a Dream,' if she needs to take a tenth of a second to have a thought before she sings it, or to have an emotion before she sings a line, she can take it."<ref name="Gettell">Gettell, Oliver (4 November 2012).

== Directing style ==
[[File:Damned United Kings Speech framing.jpg|thumb|Hooper adopted a style of framing actors at the extreme edge of a scene in both ''The Damned United'' (top) and ''The King's Speech'' (bottom)]]

Hooper also uses uncommon framing techniques to emphasise story; in ''John Adams'', he wanted to imply American independence seemed unlikely during the Revolutionary War, so he used "a very rough camera style—almost all hand held, wide lenses close to the actors, lots of movement, many cameras shooting at once so there was often not a settled master "point of view", and lots of unmatching [[dutch tilt]]s so the horizon lines of the frame were often being thrown off."<ref name="webchat"/> The America-set scenes were contrasted by the scenes set in France, in which more traditional filming techniques were employed to evoke a feel of entrenched values.<ref name="webchat"/> Similarly, in ''The Damned United'', Hooper began to experiment with using wide-angle lenses and putting actors in the extreme edges of the frame. He was influenced by the unusual framing from social photography of the 1970s, and he and Ben Smithard decided to adopt the framing style while scouting locations.<ref name=Hope/> Hooper used the same style in ''The King's Speech'', particularly in the scene where Bertie and Logue meet in Logue's consulting room; Colin Firth is framed to the extreme left of the picture, leaving most of the shot dominated by the rough wall behind Firth.<ref name="webchat"/><ref name="Oconnell">O'Connell, Seann (22 December 2010). "[http://www.hollywoodnews.com/2010/12/22/tom-hooper-the-kings-speech-for-your-consideration/ Tom Hooper, The King's Speech – For Your Consideration]". HollywoodNews.com (Hollywood Movie News). URL retrieved on 6 July 2011 ([http://www.webcitation.org/5zyh9OEkD archived] by WebCite on 6 July 2011).</ref>

Another frequently used technique is Hooper's tendency to use a variety of focal length camera lenses to distort the resulting picture.<ref name=Oppenheimer>Oppenheimer, Jean (December 2010). "Production Slate: A Future King Finds His Voice". ''American Cinematographer'' (American Society of Cinematographers) '''91''' (12): pp.&nbsp;18–22.</ref> In ''The Damned United'' he used a 10mm lens, notably in the scene where Clough stays inside during the Derby–Leeds match. Hooper operated the camera in this scene himself.<ref name=Hope>Hope-Jones, Mark (November 2009). "Kicked Off the Pitch". ''American Cinematographer'' (American Society of Cinematographers) '''90''' (11): pp.&nbsp;58–65.</ref> In ''The King's Speech'', Hooper used "typically 14mm, 18mm, 21mm, 25mm and 27mm" lenses and put the camera close to the actors' faces.<ref name=Oppenheimer/> Hooper said the use of this method in the first consulting room scene served to "suggest the awkardness and tension of Logue and Bertie's first meeting".<ref name="webchat"/>
