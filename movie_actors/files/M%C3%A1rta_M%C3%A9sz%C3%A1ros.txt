'''Márta Mészáros''' (born September 19, 1931) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[screenwriter]] and [[film director]]. Daughter of [[László Mészáros (sculptor)|László Mészáros]], a [[sculptor]], Mészáros began her career working in [[documentary film]] and made 25 documentary shorts over the span of ten years, before making her first feature film ''[[Eltavozott nap]]'' (''[[The Girl (1968 film)|The Girl]]''), which was released in 1968.<ref name="The Films of Márta Mészáros">{{cite news |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1211850| title=''The Films of Márta Mészáros or the Importance of Being Banal''|accessdate=2012-04-30 |work=jstor.org.com | first=Barbara Halpern | last=Martineau}}</ref> The first feature film directed by a woman in the history of Hungarian cinema<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1212935| title=''Screen Memories The Hungarian Cinema of Márta Mészáros''|accessdate=2012-04-30 |work=jstor.org.com| first=Barbara Koenig| last=Quart}}</ref> and the winner of the [[Special Prize of the Jury]] of the [[International Film Festival]] in [[Valladolid]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.day.kiev.ua/305726| title=''Márta Mészáros: Happiness is Being Strong Enough to Fight for Yourself, and to be Cruel at Times''|accessdate=2012-04-30 |work=day.kiev.ua| first=Iryna | last=Hordiichuk}}</ref>

Her films often combine autobiographical details with documentary footage and deal with the denial of a biographical past, lying and its consequences, and the problematics of gender.  Mészáros heroines are often from fragmented families: young girls seeking their missing parents (''The Girl'') or middle aged single women hoping to adopt a child (''[[Adoption (film)|Adoption]]'').<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2499665| title=''Screen Memories: The Hungarian Cinema of Márta Mészáros. by Catherine Portuges''|accessdate=2012-04-30 |work=jstor.org.com| first=Kevin | last=Moss}}</ref>

Although Mészáros has made over fifteen feature films she is probably best known for her film ''[[Diary for My Children]]'' (1984), which won the [[Grand-Prix Award]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and is the first film in a trilogy of autobiographical films that also includes ''[[Diary for my Lovers]]'' (1987), and ''[[Diary for my Father and Mother]]'' (1990).

Mészáros is also the winner of the [[Golden Bear]] and [[Silver Bear]] awards at the [[Berlinale]], Golden medal at the [[Chicago International Film Festival]], [[Silver Shell]] at the [[San Sebastian International Film Festival]], and the [[FIPRESCI Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. In 1991 she was a member of the jury at the [[17th Moscow International Film Festival]].<ref name="Moscow1991">{{cite web |url=http://www.moscowfilmfestival.ru/miff34/eng/archives/?year=1991 |title=17th Moscow International Film Festival (1991) |accessdate=2013-03-02 |work=MIFF}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Born in Budapest, Mészáros spent the first two years of her life in the [[Soviet Union]], where her parents had emigrated as communist artists in 1936. There Mészáros's father, [[László Mészáros (sculptor)|László Mészáros]], was arrested and killed in 1938 under the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] regime, and her mother died. Orphaned, Mészáros was raised by her foster mother in the USSR where she attended school. After returning to Hungary in 1946, Mészáros went back to [[Moscow]] to study at [[VGIK]], returning again to Hungary only after her graduation in 1956.

==Career==
Mészáros began working at the [[Budapest Newsreel Studio]] in 1954 where she made four short films, and then for the [[Alexandru Sahia]] documentary studio in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], from 1957–59. She then returned to Budapest in 1958 to make science popularization shorts, and documentary shorts, where she worked until 1968. Mészáros joined the [[Mafilm Group 4]] in the mid-1960s, and directed her first feature in 1968.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.filmreference.com/Directors-Lu-Mi/M-sz-ros-M-rta.html| title=''Mészáros, Márta''|accessdate=2012-04-30 |work=filmreference.com| first=Tina | last=Gianoulis}}</ref> Since that time Mészáros has made over fifty films, won numerous awards, and has been a judge on various film panels; she also continues to make films to this day.

==Legacy==
Mészáros films are in many ways reflective of her experiences growing up and deal with issues that are relevant to her life. Having lost both of her parents early in life, and having spent much of her youth living in a post-Stalinist Hungary Mészáros life was rife with tragedy and oppression, and her films are often reflective of this.  Additionally, because Mészáros spent many of her first years as a filmmaker working in documentary films, many of her feature films also contain lots of documentary footage. In most Mészáros features the films are open-ended, lack a conventional plot, and dialogue is sparse. 

In terms of content, Mészáros films explore the wide and often tragic gaps between ideals and realities, and between parents and their children. Mészáros's films deal with realities usually ignored in [[Eastern European]] cinema: the subordination of women, conflicts of urban and rural cultures, antagonism between the [[bureaucracy]] and its employees, [[alcoholism]], the generation gap, dissolution of traditional family structures, and the plight of state-reared children.

Mészáros is one of few female filmmakers who consistently makes films both critically and commercially successful for an international audience. Her eight feature films made from 1968 to 1979 are concerned with the social oppression, economic constraints, and emotional challenges faced by Hungarian women. In her own words Mészáros explains: "I tell banal, commonplace stories, and then in them the leads are women—I portray things from a woman's angle."

==Personal life==
Mészáros was first married to [[László Karda]] (a filmmaker), in 1957, but they divorced in 1959, and in 1960 she married [[Miklós Jancsó]], a Hungarian [[film director]] and [[screenwriter]] whom she met during her time with the Mafilm Group 4.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/76/Marta-Meszaros.html| title=''Marta Meszaros Biography (1931-)''|accessdate=2012-04-30 |work=filmreference.com}}</ref> Although they later divorced in 1973, their two sons, [[Nyika Jancsó]] and [[Miklós Jancsó Jr.]], have each separately worked as [[director of photography]] on many of her films.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/135210/Olyan-mint-otthon/overview |title=NY Times.com: Just Like Home |accessdate=2010-01-31 |work=nytimes.com | first=Janet | last=Maslin}}</ref> She later married the [[Poland|Polish]] actor [[Jan Nowicki]], but they divorced in 2008. [[Nowicki]] starred in many of her films, including the principal role in ''[[The Unburied Dead]]''. His son from an earlier relationship, [[Łukasz Nowicki]], starred in Mészáros' film, ''[[Kisvilma]]''. Mészáros also has a daughter, [[Kasia Jancsó]], from her second marriage.
