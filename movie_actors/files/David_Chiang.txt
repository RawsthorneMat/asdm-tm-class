==Biography==
[[File:David Chiang, Avenue of Stars.jpg|thumb|left|David Chiang's hand prints and autograph on the [[Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong]]]]
David Chiang's mother Hung Wei (real name: Lo Chen) and father Yen Hua (real name: Chiang Ko-chi) were popular Chinese movie stars who arrived in Hong Kong in the late 1940s during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Chiang began his acting career at a very early age, appearing in black and white films when he was only four years old.

In 1966, while working as a stuntman and fight instructor for the [[Shaw Brothers Studio]], he was spotted by director Chang Cheh, who immediately saw his potential and screen presence and became his mentor. Chang gave him the [[stage name]] David Chiang, even though his real English name was John.

With [[Jimmy Wang Yu|Wang Yu]]'s sudden departure in 1969, [[Run Run Shaw]] and his senior executives were looking for a new leading man and made Chiang an offer. With the guidance of Chang Cheh, Chiang won the Best Actor award at the 16th Asian Film Festival in 1970 for his role in ''[[Vengeance (1970 film)|Vengeance]]''. In 1972, at the 18th Asian Film Festival, he won the [[Golden Horse Award]] for Best Actor for his role in ''[[Blood Brothers (1973 film)|Blood Brothers]]''. In 1973, at the 19th Asian Film Festival, he won the Most Contemporary award for his role in ''[[The Generation Gap]]''.

In 1973 Chiang left Hong Kong with his mentor Chang Cheh and set up an independent production company called Chang's Scope Company. With the backing and encouragement of Run Run Shaw, their films continued to be distributed through Shaw's channels. At Chang's Scope Company, Chiang was able to try his hand at directing, producing and script writing. As the 1970s came to an end and the 1980s approached, Chiang continued acting, working with directors [[Lee Han Chiang]], [[Hsueh Li Pao]], [[Ho Meng-hua]] and [[Chia-Liang Liu]]. 1980 was also the start of his first television series, ''[[The Green Dragon Conspiracy]]'', and this was followed by ''[[Princess Chang Ping]]'' and Dynasty. In the mid-1980s, Chiang worked with his two brothers, Paul Chun and [[Derek Yee]], directing, producing and acting in the comedy ''[[Legend of the Owl]]''. Chiang also acted in comedy movies ''The Challenger'' and ''[[The Loot]]'', directed by [[Eric Tseng]]. In late 1980s into the 1990s Chiang directed the movies ''[[Heaven Can Help]]'', ''[[Silent Love (1986 film)|Silent Love]]'', ''[[The Wrong Couples]]'', ''[[Mr. Handsome]]'', ''[[Double Fattiness]]'', ''[[My Dear Son]]'', ''[[Will of Iron]]'' and ''[[Mother of a Different Kind]]''. Since 2000 he has continued to work in movies and TV series, including ''[[Election (2005 film)|Election]]'', ''[[Daisy (2006 film)|Daisy]]'', ''[[Revolving Doors Of Vengeance]]'', ''[[Lethal Weapons of Love and Passion]]'', ''[[Land of Wealth]]'', ''[[The Family Link]]'' and the 2007 television series ''[[The Gem of Life]]''. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 2006 for his role in the [[TVB]] series ''Revolving Doors of Vengeance''.

In 2004 Chiang was inducted into [[The Avenue of Stars]], which honours celebrities of the [[Hong Kong film industry]]. It is located along the [[Victoria Harbour]] waterfront in [[Tsim Sha Tsui]], Hong Kong and modeled on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].
