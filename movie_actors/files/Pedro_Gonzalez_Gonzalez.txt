'''Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez''' (May 24, 1925 – February 6, 2006) was an [[United States|American]] [[character actor]] best known for his appearances in a number of [[John Wayne]] movies.

== Biography ==
Born '''Ramiro Gonzalez-Gonzalez''' in [[Aguilares, Texas|Aguilares]], [[Texas]] to a [[Mexican American]] father and a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] mother with identical surnames, Gonzalez-Gonzalez grew up in a talent-filled home. His father was a [[trumpet]] player, and his mother was a dancer. His brother was actor [[Jose Gonzales-Gonzales]] (1922-2000).<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0327601/ Jose Gonzales-Gonzales at IMDB]</ref>  He left school at the age of seven to join a family act called "Las Perlitas" that toured southwest Texas. As a result, he was functionally [[Literacy|illiterate]] for all of his life. As a result of his illiteracy, he memorized scripts by having his wife read them to him. Gonzalez-Gonzalez married at the age of seventeen and served in [[World War II]]. After the war he performed [[stand-up comedy]] for Spanish-speaking audiences.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0327602/bio Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez at IMDB] (Retrieved on 2008-01-25)</ref>

In 1953, he appeared on the [[Groucho Marx]] quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' under the name Ramiro G. Gonzalez, where his banter with Marx attracted notice. Marx asked him: "What does the 'G' stand for?" to which he replied "Gonzalez", and explained that both his parents had been surnamed "Gonzalez" before being married.  So Marx asked: "What does your wife call you: Ramiro or Gonzalez?" He replied "She calls me 'Pedro'", triggering audience laughter. After Gonzalez performed a 15-second comic dance to strong applause, Marx complimented his guest's comedic skill, saying: "Pedro, we could do a great act together. We could make a fortune in vaudeville, you and I. What -- what would we call our act, you know, if we went out together? 'The Two Hot Tamales'?" After Pedro deadpanned "Gonzalez-Gonzalez and Marx", Groucho made an aside: "That's a nice billing. Two people in the act, and I get third place in the place!" <ref>{{YouTube|C0mucg6nN_g|Episode aired February 12, 1953}}</ref>

John Wayne saw his appearance on the program and cast him as comic relief in a number of movies including ''[[Rio Bravo (movie)|Rio Bravo]],'' ''[[The High and the Mighty (film)|The High and the Mighty]]'' and ''[[Hellfighters (film)|Hellfighters]].'' He also made guest appearances in shows such as ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', as well as the [[Jerry Lewis]] film, ''[[Hook, Line & Sinker (1969 film)|Hook, Line & Sinker]]''.  Wayne also had [[Burt Kennedy]] write a TV series for Gonzalez-Gonzalez that was never made.<ref>[http://parallax-view.org/2008/11/06/burt-kennedy-writing-broadway-in-arizona/]</ref>

Gonzalez-Gonzalez played extra characters behind [[Mel Blanc]] in a number of [[Speedy Gonzales]] cartoons, including "[[A Taste of Catnip]]" and "[[Go Go Amigo]]," billed generally as Gonzalez Gonzalez.

As a result of playing comic relief roles, he was accused of perpetuating negative [[Ethnic stereotype|stereotypes]] about Hispanic men. However, [[Edward James Olmos]] said of Gonzalez-Gonzalez at the time of his death that he "inspired every Latino actor."<ref>[http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/states/california/northern_california/13878316.htm Obituary in the San Jose Mercury News]</ref>

He died at his home of natural causes, and was survived by his wife Leandra and three children.<ref>[Chicago Tribune obituary, February 19, 2006, page 7, section 4]</ref>

He is the grandfather of actor [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]
