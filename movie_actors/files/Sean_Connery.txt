== Early life ==
Thomas Sean Connery, named Thomas after his grandfather, was born in [[Fountainbridge]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. His mother, Euphemia McBain "Effie" (née McLean), was a cleaning woman, and his father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and [[lorry]] driver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/58/Sean-Connery.html|title=Sean Connery Biography|publisher=filmreference.com|accessdate=29 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=

His father was a [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Roman Catholic]], and his mother was a Protestant. He has a younger brother, [[Neil Connery|Neil]] (b. 1938). Connery claims he was called Sean, his middle name, long before becoming an actor, explaining that when he was young he had an Irish friend named Séamus and that those who knew them both had decided to call Connery by his middle name whenever both were present. He was generally referred to in his youth as "Tommy".{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=8}} Although he was small in primary school, he grew rapidly around the age of 12, reaching his full adult height of {{convert|6|ft|2|in|cm|abbr=on}} at 18. He was known during his teen years as "Big Tam", and has claimed to have lost his virginity to an adult woman in an [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]] uniform at the age of 14.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=18}} {{sfn|Yule|1992|p=21}}

Connery's first job was as a [[milkman]] in Edinburgh with [[St. Cuthbert's Co-operative Society]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/greatscots.cfm?id=2275262005|title=From the Co-op with love.. the days Sir Sean earned £1 a week|work=The Scotsman  |location=UK|accessdate=29 September 2007|date=21 November 2005}}</ref> He then joined the [[Royal Navy]], during which time he acquired two tattoos, of which his official website says "unlike many tattoos, his were not frivolous—his tattoos reflect two of his lifelong commitments: his family and Scotland. ... One tattoo is a tribute to his parents and reads 'Mum and Dad,' and the other is self-explanatory, 'Scotland Forever.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seanconnery.com/biography/ |title=The Official Website of Sir Sean Connery – Biography |publisher=Seanconnery.com |accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref>

Connery was later [[Military discharge|discharged]] from the navy on medical grounds because of a [[duodenal]] [[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]], a condition that affected most of the males in previous generations of his family.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=4}}  Afterwards, he returned to the co-op, then worked as, among other things, a lorry driver, a lifeguard at [[Portobello, Edinburgh|Portobello]] swimming baths, a labourer, an [[model (art)|artist's model]] for the [[Edinburgh College of Art]], and after a suggestion by former Mr. Scotland, Archie Brennan,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment.cfm?id=924382003|title=Even as an unknown, Sean was still a draw|work=The Scotsman  |location=UK|accessdate=29 September 2007|date=22 August 2003|first=Lynn|last=Davidson}}</ref>{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=28}} a coffin [[French polish|polisher]]. The modelling earned him 15 shillings an hour.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=28}}  Student artist [[Richard Demarco]] who painted several notable early pictures of Connery described him as "very straight, slightly shy, too, too beautiful for words, a virtual Adonis."{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=29}}

Connery began [[bodybuilding]] at the age of 18, and from 1951 trained heavily with Ellington, a former gym instructor in the British army.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=31}}  While his official website claims he was third in the 1950 [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] contest, most sources place him in the 1953 competition, either third in the Junior class<ref name=Tiscali>{{cite web |url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/sean-connery/biography/114?page=4 |title=Sean Connery – Biography |last=Wills |first=Dominic |publisher=[[Tiscali]] |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> or failing to place in the Tall Man classification.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://musclememory.com/show.php?c=Mr+Universe+-+NABBA&y=1953 |title=1953 Mr. Universe – NABBA |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> Connery stated that he was soon deterred from bodybuilding when he found that the Americans frequently beat him in competitions because of sheer muscle size and, unlike Connery, refused to participate in athletic activity which could make them lose muscle mass.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=35}}

Connery was a keen [[association football|footballer]], having played for [[Bonnyrigg Rose Athletic F.C.|Bonnyrigg Rose]] in his younger days. He was offered a trial with [[East Fife F.C.|East Fife]]. While on tour with ''South Pacific'', Connery played in a football match against a local team that [[Matt Busby]], manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], happened to be scouting. According to reports, Busby was impressed with his physical prowess and offered Connery a contract worth [[Pound sterling|£]]25 a week immediately after the game. Connery admits that he was tempted to accept, but he recalls, "I realised that a top-class footballer could be over the hill by the age of 30, and I was already 23. I decided to become an actor and it turned out to be one of my more intelligent moves."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/sjfa/scottish_football.cfm?page=1711 |title=Scottish Junior Football Association > Mud & Glory > Sean Connery |accessdate=21 October 2012 |date=April 2005 |publisher=Mud & Glory }}</ref>{{r|playboy196511}}

== Career ==

=== 1950s ===
Looking to pick up some extra money, Connery helped out backstage at the [[King's Theatre, Edinburgh|King's Theatre]] in late 1951.<ref name=Tiscali/> He became interested in the proceedings, and a career was launched. During a bodybuilding competition held in London in 1953, one of the competitors mentioned that auditions were being held for a production of ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'';<ref name=Tiscali/> and Connery landed a small part as one of the Seabees chorus boys. By the time the production reached Edinburgh, he had been given the part of Marine Cpl Hamilton Steeves and was understudying two of the juvenile leads, and his salary was raised from £12 to £14–10s a week.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=36}} The production returned the following year out of popular demand, and Connery was promoted to the featuring role of Lieutenant Buzz Adams, which [[Larry Hagman]] had portrayed in the West End.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=36}} While in Edinburgh, Connery was targeted by the notorious Valdor gang, one of the most ruthless gangs in the city. He was first approached by them in a billiard hall on Lothian Street where he prevented them from stealing from his jacket and was later followed by six gang members to a 15&nbsp;ft high balcony at the Palais.{{sfn|Sellers|1999|p=21}} There Connery launched an attack single-handedly against the gang members, grabbing one by the throat and another by a biceps and cracked their heads together. From then on he was treated with great respect by the gang and gained a reputation as a "hard man".{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=32-3}} Connery first met [[Michael Caine]] at a party during the production of ''South Pacific'' in 1954, and the two would later become close friends.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=36}} During the production of ''South Pacific'' at the [[Opera House, Manchester]] over the Christmas period of 1954, Connery developed a serious interest in the theatre through American director and actor [[Robert Henderson (actor)|Robert Henderson]] who loaned him copies of the [[Henrik Ibsen]] works ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'', ''[[The Wild Duck]]'', and ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'', and later listed works by the likes of [[Marcel Proust]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]],  [[James Joyce]], and [[William Shakespeare]] for him to digest.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=38-9}} Henderson urged him to take elocution lessons and got him parts at the [[Maida Vale Theatre]] in London, and he had already begun pursuing a film career, playing an extra in [[Herbert Wilcox]]'s 1954 musical ''[[Lilacs in the Spring]]'' alongside [[Anna Neagle]].{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=43}}

Although Connery had secured several roles as extras, he was struggling to make ends meet, and was forced to accept a part-time job as a babysitter for journalist Peter Noble and his actress wife [[Marianne Stone|Mary]], which earned him 10 shillings a night.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=43}}  He met Hollywood actress [[Shelley Winters]] one night at Noble's house who described Connery as "one of the tallest and most charming and masculine Scotsmen" she'd ever seen, and later spent many evenings with the Connery brothers drinking beer.
{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=43}} Around this time Connery was residing at TV presenter [[Llew Gardner]]'s house. Henderson got Connery a role in a £6 a week [[Q Theatre]] production of [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (play)|Witness for the Prosecution]]'', during which he met and became friends with fellow-Scot [[Ian Bannen]].{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=45}} This role was followed by ''Point of Departure'' and ''A Witch in Time'' at Kew, a role as Pentheus opposite [[Yvonne Mitchell]] in ''[[The Bacchae]]'' at the [[Oxford Playhouse]], and a role opposite [[Jill Bennett (British actress)|Jill Bennett]] in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s production of ''[[Anna Christie]]''.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=45}} During his time at the Oxford Theatre, Connery won a brief part as a boxer in the TV series ''The Square Ring'', before being spotted by Canadian director [[Alvin Rakoff]] who gave him multiple roles in ''The Condemned'', shot on location in Dover in Kent. In 1956, Connery appeared in the theatrical production of ''Epitaph'', and played a minor role as a hoodlum in the "Ladies of the Manor" episode of the ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]''.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=45}} This was followed by small television parts in ''[[Sailor of Fortune]]'' and ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]''.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=45}}

In the spring of 1957, Connery hired agent Richard Hatton who got him a role as Spike, a minor [[gangster]] with a speech impediment in [[Montgomery Tully]]'s ''[[No Road Back]]'' alongside [[Skip Homeier]], [[Paul Carpenter (actor)|Paul Carpenter]], [[Patricia Dainton]] and [[Norman Wooland]].{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=291}} In April 1957, the aforementioned Alvin Rakoff, after being disappointed by Jack Palance, decided to give the young actor his first chance in a leading role and cast Connery as Mountain McLintock in BBC TV's outstanding production of Requiem For A Heavyweight which also starred Warren Mitchell and Jacqueline Hill. He then played a rogue lorry driver Johnny Yates in  [[Cy Endfield]]'s ''[[Hell Drivers (film)|Hell Drivers]]'' (1957) alongside [[Stanley Baker]], [[Herbert Lom]], [[Peggy Cummins]] and [[Patrick McGoohan]].<ref name="Sellers1999">{{cite book|last=Sellers|first=Robert|title=Sean Connery: a celebration|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=360dAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=14 July 2011|date=December 1999|publisher=Robert Hale|isbn=978-0-7090-6125-0|page=42}}</ref> Later in 1957 Connery appeared in [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]]'s poorly received [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] action picture ''[[Action of the Tiger]]''  opposite [[Van Johnson]], [[Martine Carol]], Herbert Lom and [[Gustavo Rojo]]; the film was shot on location in southern Spain.<ref name="Baldwin1999">{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Louis|title=Turning Points: Pivotal Moments in the Careers of 83 Famous Figures|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ElUgVxFWBcoC&pg=PA53|accessdate=14 July 2011|date=September 1999|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-0626-5|page=53}}</ref><ref name="Callan2002">{{cite book|last=Callan|first=Michael Feeney|title=Sean Connery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Lq0dAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=14 July 2011|date=1 November 2002|publisher=Virgin|isbn=978-1-85227-992-9|page=75}}</ref> He also had a minor role in  [[Gerald Thomas]]'s thriller ''[[Time Lock]]'' (1957) as a welder, appearing alongside [[Robert Beatty]], [[Lee Patterson]], [[Betty McDowall]] and [[Vincent Winter]], which commenced filming on 1 December 1956 at [[Beaconsfield Studios]].<ref name="PfeifferLisa1997">{{cite book|last1=Pfeiffer|first1=Lee|last2=Lisa|first2=Philip|title=The films of Sean Connery|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L60dAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=14 July 2011|date=February 1997|publisher=Carol Pub.

In 1958, he had a major role in the [[melodrama]] ''[[Another Time, Another Place (1958 film)|Another Time, Another Place]]'' (1958) as a British reporter named Mark Trevor, caught in a love affair opposite [[Lana Turner]] and [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]]. During filming, star [[Lana Turner]]'s possessive gangster boyfriend, [[Johnny Stompanato]], who was visiting from Los Angeles, believed she was having an affair with Connery. He stormed onto the set and pointed a gun at Connery, only to have Connery disarm him and knock him flat on his back. Stompanato was banned from the set. Connery later recounted that he had to lie low for a while after receiving threats from men linked to Stompanato's boss, [[Mickey Cohen]].

In 1959, Connery landed a leading role in  [[Robert Stevenson (director)|Robert Stevenson]]'s [[Walt Disney Productions]] film ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]'' (1959) alongside [[Albert Sharpe]], [[Janet Munro]], and [[Jimmy O'Dea]]. The film is a tale about a wily Irishman and his battle of wits with [[leprechauns]]. Upon the film's initial release, A. H. Weiler of the ''[[New York Times]]'' praised the cast (save Connery whom he described as "merely tall, dark, and handsome") and thought the film an "overpoweringly charming concoction of standard Gaelic tall stories, fantasy and romance.".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E5DF1F3CE63BBC4953DFB1668382649EDE|author=Weiler, A.

He also had a prominent television role in [[Rudolph Cartier]]'s 1961 productions of ''[[Adventure story (television)|Adventure Story]]'' and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' for [[BBC Television]], in the latter of which he co-starred with [[Claire Bloom]].<ref name="karenina">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1181098/index.html|title=Cartier, Rudolph (1904–1994)|first=Oliver|last=Wake|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=25 February 2007}}</ref>

=== James Bond: 1962–71, 1983 ===
Connery's [[Breakthrough role|breakthrough]] came in the role of secret agent [[James Bond]]. He was reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the films succeeded his career would greatly benefit.{{r|playboy196511}} He played the character in the first five Bond films: ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963), ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964), ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965), and ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967) – then appeared again as Bond in ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971) and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983). All seven films were commercially successful. James Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|third-greatest hero in cinema history]] by the [[American Film Institute]].<ref>[http://www.afi.com/100Years/handv.aspx "AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains"]. AFI. Retrieved 20 December 2013</ref>

Connery's selection as James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of Cubby Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading Cubby that Sean Connery was the right man.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bray|first=Christopher|title=Sean Connery: The Measure Of A Man|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1455828/Dana-Broccoli.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=3 March 2004|location=London}}</ref>  James Bond's creator, [[Ian Fleming]], originally doubted Connery's casting, saying, "He's not what I envisioned of James Bond looks" and "I'm looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man," adding that Connery (muscular, 6' 2", and a Scot) was unrefined. Fleming's girlfriend told him Connery had the requisite sexual charisma. Fleming changed his mind after the successful ''Dr. No'' première; he was so impressed, he created a half-Scottish, half-Swiss heritage for Bond in the later novels.

Connery's portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], polishing the actor while using his physical grace and presence for the action. [[Lois Maxwell]], who played [[Miss Moneypenny]], related that, "Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat."{{sfn|Macintyre|2012|p=unknown}} The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week, and the actor became one of the great male [[sex symbol]]s of film.<ref name="playboy196511">{{cite news | url=http://seanconneryonline.com/art_playboy1165.htm | title=PLAYBOY INTERVIEW: SEAN CONNERY | work=Playboy | date=November 1965 | accessdate=25 October 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Sean Connery 1964.png|thumbnail|Connery in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'']]
During the filming of ''Thunderball'' in 1965, Connery's life was in danger in the sequence with the sharks in [[Emilio Largo]]'s pool. He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that [[Ken Adam]] build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool, but, despite this, it was not a fixed structure and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately.<ref name="TerenceYoung">{{cite video |people = [[Terence Young (director)|Young, Terence]] |title = Commentary 1: Thunderball Ultimate Edition DVD Region 4 |format = [[Audio commentary]] |medium = DVD |publisher = MGM/UA Home Entertainment |accessdate = 21 May 2013}}</ref>

Connery was forced to wear a [[Toupée|toupee]] during each of the Bond movies because he had started balding at the age of 21.<ref>{{IMDb name|125|section=bio}}</ref> This didn't prevent Connery from being cast in roles although it became more noticeable in his later years.

In 2005, ''From Russia with Love'' was adapted by [[Electronic Arts]] into a video game, titled ''[[James Bond 007: From Russia with Love]]'', which featured all-new voice work by Connery as well as his likeness, and those of several of the film's supporting cast.

=== Beyond Bond ===
Although Bond had made him a star, Connery eventually tired of the role and the pressure the franchise put on him, saying "[I am] fed up to here with the whole Bond bit"{{r|playboy196511}} and "I have always hated that damned James Bond. I'd like to kill him".<ref name="ferguson20041002">{{cite web | url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/oct/03/comment.news | title=Scotch myth | work=The Observer | date=2 October 2004 | accessdate=18 September 2013 | author=Ferguson, Euan}}</ref> Michael Caine said of the situation, "If you were his friend in these early days you didn't raise the subject of Bond. He was, and is, a much better actor than just playing James Bond, but he became synonymous with Bond. He'd be walking down the street and people would say, "Look, there's James Bond." That was particularly upsetting to him."{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=34}} While making the Bond films, Connery also starred in other acclaimed films such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Hill (film)|The Hill]]'' (1965). Apart from ''[[The Man Who Would Be King (film)|The Man Who Would Be King]]'' and ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'', both released in 1975, most of Connery's successes in the next decade were as part of ensemble casts in films such as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and [[John Gielgud]] and ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (1977) co-starring [[Dirk Bogarde]] and [[Laurence Olivier]]. Connery shared a [[Henrietta Award#Retired awards|Henrietta Award]] with [[Charles Bronson]] for "World Film Favorite – Male" in 1972.

In 1981, Connery appeared in the film ''[[Time Bandits]]'' as [[Agamemnon]]. The casting choice derives from a joke [[Michael Palin]] included in the script, in which he describes the character removing his mask as being "Sean Connery&nbsp;— or someone of equal but cheaper stature".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=109365&section=extras |title=Time Bandits Extras |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=7 March 2013| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090409212649/http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=109365&section=extras| archivedate= 9 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}}</ref>
When shown the script, Connery was happy to play the supporting role.

After his experience with ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' in 1983 and the following court case, Connery became unhappy with the major studios and for two years did not make any films. Following the successful European production ''[[The Name of the Rose (film)|The Name of the Rose]]'' (1986), for which he won a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award, Connery's interest in more commercial material was revived. That same year, a supporting role in ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' showcased his ability to play older mentors to younger leads, which would become a recurring role in many of his later films. The following year, his acclaimed performance as a hard-nosed Irish-American cop in ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987) earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], his sole nomination throughout his career. Fellow nominees included Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, both of whom would go on to win the award. His subsequent box-office hits included ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (1989), in which he played Henry Jones Sr., the title character's father, ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990) (where he was reportedly called in at two weeks' notice<ref>{{cite news|last=Harlow|first=Cas|title=The Hunt for Red October Review|url=http://www.avforums.com/movies/The-Hunt-for-Red-October-review_10729/movie.html|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=[[AV Club]]|date=10 November 2011}}</ref>), ''[[The Russia House (film)|The Russia House]]'' (1990), ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' (1996), and ''[[Entrapment (film)|Entrapment]]'' (1999). In 1996, he voiced the role of Draco the dragon in the film ''[[Dragonheart]]''. In 1998, Sean Connery received a [[BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award]].

Connery's later films have included several box office and critical disappointments such as ''[[First Knight]]'' (1995), ''[[The Avengers (1998 film)|The Avengers]]'' (1998), and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' (2003), but he also received positive reviews, including his performance in ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000). He also received a [[Crystal Globe]] for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema.

Connery stated in interviews that he was offered a role in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' series,<ref>{{cite news|title=Connery 'turning back on movies'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4736303.stm|work=BBC News|date=1 August 2005|accessdate=6 August 2012}}</ref> <!--Interviews for which film?

=== Retirement ===
When Connery received the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] on 8 June 2006, he confirmed his retirement from acting. On 7 June 2007, he denied rumours that he would appear in the [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|fourth ''Indiana Jones'']] film, stating that "retirement is just too much damned fun".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6733177.stm|title=Connery bows out of Indiana film|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 September 2007|date=8 June 2007}}</ref>

Connery returned to voice acting, playing the title character in the animated short ''[[Sir Billi|Sir Billi the Vet]]'', and in 2005 he recorded voiceovers for a [[From Russia with Love (video game)|new video game version]] of his Bond film ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lipsey|first=Sid|title=Review: Connery brings Bond back to the U.S.S.R.|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2005-11-10/tech/bond.rwl_1_bond-moves-aston-martin-db5-sean-connery?_s=PM:TECH|work=cnn|date=10 November 2005|accessdate=6 August 2012}}</ref> In an interview on the game disc, Connery stated that he was very happy that the producers of the game ([[EA Games]]) had approached him to voice Bond and that he hoped to do another one in the near future. In 2010, he reprised his role in an expanded 80-minute version of ''Sir Billi'', serving also as executive producer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/7053/Sir-Sean-makes-film-comeback.6218584.jp |title=Sir Sean makes film comeback as a retired vet |publisher= ''[[The Scotsman]]'' |first=Alan |last=Carson |date=12 April 2010 |location=Edinburgh |accessdate=7 March 2013| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101012033011/http://news.scotsman.com/7053/Sir-Sean-makes-film-comeback.6218584.jp| archivedate= 12 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}}</ref> In 2010, a bronze bust sculpture of Connery was placed in [[Tallinn|the capital city]] of Estonia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20110127/D9L0R9E01.html |title=Sean Connery immortalised with Estonian bust |publisher=Apnews.myway.com |date= |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>

His last public appearance was on 11 September 2012 at the [[2012 US Open (tennis)|2012 US Open]] tennis tournament, supporting tennis player and fellow Scotsman [[Andy Murray]]. Together with [[Alex Ferguson]] and Murray's mother [[Judy Murray|Judy]], he gatecrashed Murray's post-semi-final press conference.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Sean Connery celebrate with Andy Murray at US Open|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/09/alex-ferguson-andy-murray-us-open|publisher=The Guardian | location=London|first=Kevin|last=Mitchell|date=9 September 2012}}</ref>

In the film ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', the character [[Sentinel Prime]]'s features were mostly based on Connery. When [[Leonard Nimoy]] was to voice the role, however, the effects were altered to incorporate Nimoy's acting as well.<ref name=ILMpanel>{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/27178595|title=Transformers-3 ILM Panel-desktop|date=1 August 2011|accessdate=20 August 2011|publisher=Visual Effects Society}}{{Dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

Director [[Sam Mendes]] confirmed that Connery was considered being cast in the Kincaide role taken by [[Albert Finney]] in ''[[Skyfall]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemas-online.co.uk/latest-film-news/sam-mendes-talks-sean-connery-skyfall-cameo--a109850.html |title=Sam Mendes talks Sean Connery 'Skyfall' cameo &#124; Cinemas Online NEWS |publisher=Cinemas-online.co.uk |date= |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> but stated the idea was shelved as being distracting to the film.

During the production of ''South Pacific'' in the mid-1950s, Connery dated a "dark-haired beauty with a ballerina's figure", Carol Sopel, but was warned off by her Jewish family.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=40}} He then dated a blonde named Julie Hamilton; given his rugged appearance and rough charm she initially thought he was a most appalling person and was not attracted to him until she saw him in a [[kilt]], declaring him to be the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen in her life.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=41}}  He also shared a mutual attraction with black jazz singer [[Maxine Daniels]], whom he met at the Empire Theatre. He made a pass at her, but she informed him that she was already happily married with a baby daughter.{{sfn|Yule|1992|p=37}} Connery was married to actress [[Diane Cilento]] from 1962 to 1973.

Connery ignited controversy when he reaffirmed during an interview with [[Barbara Walters]] his belief that it was socially permissible to slap a woman. “It's not the worst thing to slap a woman now and then," he remarked during the interview.  This was a follow-up to an interview he gave ''Playboy'' magazine in 1965 in which he said "An open-handed slap is justified – if all other alternatives fail and there has been plenty of warning. If a woman is a bitch, or hysterical, or bloody-minded continually, then I'd do it."<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1043053/Sean-Connery-The-story-brilliant-deeply-flawed-man.html Sean Connery: The story of a brilliant but deeply flawed man | Daily Mail Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
