For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Widmark has a star on the  [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6800 [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. In 2002, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]].

In 1941 and 1942, he was heard daily on the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] in the title role of the daytime serial ''Front Page Farrell'', introduced each afternoon as "the exciting, unforgettable radio drama... the story of a crack newspaperman and his wife, the story of David and Sally Farrell." Farrell was a top reporter for the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]''. When the series moved to [[NBC]], Widmark turned the role over to [[Carleton G. Young]] and Staats Cotsworth.

During the 1940s, Widmark was also heard on such network radio programs as ''[[Gang Busters]]'', ''[[Inner Sanctum Mysteries]]'', ''Joyce Jordan, M.D.'', ''Molle Mystery Theater'', ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'' and ''[[Ethel and Albert]]''.

==Broadway and films==

Widmark appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1943 in [[F. Hugh Herbert]]'s ''Kiss and Tell''. He was unable to join the military during [[World War II]] because of a perforated [[eardrum]]. He was in Chicago appearing in a stage production of ''[[Dream Girl (play)|Dream Girl]]'' with [[June Havoc]] when [[20th Century Fox]] signed him to a seven-year contract.<ref name=kiss>[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2008/03/26/2008-03-26_actor_richard_widmark_dies.html "Actor Richard Widmark Dies," ''Daily News'', March 26, 2008.]</ref>

Widmark's first movie appearance was in [[1947 in film|1947]]'s ''[[Kiss of Death (1947 film)|Kiss of Death]]'', as the giggling, sociopathic [[villain]] Tommy Udo.<ref name=APobit>{{cite news  |title= Tough-guy actor Richard Widmark dies at 93 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/26/obit.widmark.ap/index.html |publisher=[[Associated Press]] at [[CNN]]|date= 2008-03-26 |accessdate=2008-03-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080328230755/http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/26/obit.widmark.ap/index.html |archivedate = March 28, 2008}}</ref> His most notorious scene found Udo pushing a wheelchair-bound woman (played by [[Mildred Dunnock]]) down a flight of stairs to her death.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |author=Aljean Harmetz |title=Actor Richard Widmark Dies at 93 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/arts/26cnd-widmark.html?hp=&pagewanted=all |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2008-03-26 |accessdate=2008-03-26 }}</ref> Widmark was almost not cast. He said, "The director, [[Henry Hathaway]], didn't want me. I have a high forehead; he thought I looked too intellectual." Hathaway was overruled by studio boss [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]. "Hathaway gave me kind of a bad time," recalled Widmark.<ref name=kiss/> ''Kiss of Death'' was a commercial and critical success: Widmark won the [[Golden Globe Award for New Star Of The Year - Actor]], and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance.<ref name=APobit/> Widmark played "Dude" in the [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[Yellow Sky]]'', with [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Anne Baxter]], the following year. His name was billed third, above the title.

In 1950, Widmark co-starred with [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Barbara Bel Geddes]], [[Jack Palance]] and [[Zero Mostel]] in [[Elia Kazan]]'s ''[[Panic in the Streets (film)|Panic in the Streets]]'', and appeared opposite [[Gene Tierney]] and [[Googie Withers]] in [[Jules Dassin]]'s ''[[Night and the City]]''. Both are considered classic examples of [[film noir]]. Also in 1950, Widmark starred with [[Sidney Poitier]] in the gripping racial melodrama ''[[No Way Out (1950 film)|No Way Out]]''.

In 1952, Widmark had his handprints cast in cement at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]]. During his stint at Fox, he appeared in ''[[The Street with No Name]]'' (1948), ''[[Don't Bother to Knock]]'' (1952) with [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Samuel Fuller]]'s ''[[Pickup on South Street]]'' (1953). Widmark appeared in two Fox westerns in 1954: [[Garden of Evil]] opposite [[Gary Cooper]], and [[Broken Lance]] with [[Spencer Tracy]]. He also appeared in [[Vincente Minnelli]]'s 1955 cult film ''[[The Cobweb (film)|The Cobweb]]'' with [[Lauren Bacall]].

Widmark starred in, and also produced, a naval drama set during the [[Cold War]], ''[[The Bedford Incident]]'' (1965), modelled loosely on the [[Herman Melville]] novel, "[[Moby Dick]]". He is also credited with producing his films ''[[Time Limit (film)|Time Limit]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Secret Ways]]'' (1961).  Other notable films in the 1960s were ''[[The Alamo (1960 film)|The Alamo]]'' (1960) with [[John Wayne]] as [[Davy Crockett]] and Widmark as [[Jim Bowie]], ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961), ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Two Rode Together]]'' (1961) and ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1964) and, in "[[Madigan]]" (1968), as a police detective in the title role, which he later reprised in a televion series of the same name. During the 1970s, Widmark's films included ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974), [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'' (1978), and ''[[The Swarm (film)|The Swarm]]'' (1978). In all, Widmark appeared in over 60 films before making his final movie appearance in the 1991 thriller ''[[True Colors (1991 film)|True Colors]]''.<ref name="Sunrise Township"/>

==Television==
[[File:Richard widmark broken lance2.jpg|thumb|240px|Widmark in ''[[Broken Lance]]'' ([[1954 in film|1954]])]]
Widmark was a guest on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' in 1954. The following year, he made a rare foray into comedy on ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', portraying himself when a starstruck Lucy trespasses onto his property to steal a souvenir. Widmark finds Lucy sprawled out on his living room floor underneath a bearskin rug.

Returning to television in the early 1970s, Widmark received an Emmy nomination for his performance as Paul Roudebush, the President of the United States, in the TV movie ''Vanished!'' (1971), a [[Fletcher Knebel]] political thriller. In 1972-73, he reprised his detective role from [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[Madigan]]'' (1968) with six 90-minute episodes on the ''NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie.'' The next year, he participated in a mini-series about [[Benjamin Franklin]], transmitted in 1974, which was a unique experiment of four 90-minute dramas, each with a different actor impersonating Franklin: Widmark, [[Beau Bridges]], [[Eddie Albert]], [[Melvyn Douglas]], and, portraying Franklin at age twelve, [[Willie Aames]]. The series won a Peabody Award and five Emmys. During the 1980s, Widmark returned to TV with a half-dozen TV movies.

==Personal life and death==
[[File:Richard Widmark13.JPG|thumb|240px|Widmark speaking in [[France]], 1991]]
Widmark was married to playwright [[Jean Hazlewood]] from 1942 until her death in 1997. They had a daughter, Anne Heath Widmark, an artist and author who was married to baseball player [[Sandy Koufax]] from 1969 to 1982. In 1999, Widmark married [[Susan Blanchard (socialite)|Susan Blanchard]], the daughter of [[Dorothy Hammerstein]] and stepdaughter of [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]; she had been [[Henry Fonda]]'s third wife.

[[Green City, Missouri|Green City]], [[Missouri]], is the site of Widmark Airport {{Airport codes|||MO83}} in northeastern Missouri. Towns the size of Green City, whose population numbered only 688 inhabitants in 2000, usually do not have airports, but Widmark owned a cattle ranch in the area during the 1950s and 1960s. Widmark contributed funds to the construction of an airport which led to its being named in his honor.

Despite having spent most of his career appearing countless times in gun-toting roles such as cowboys, policemen, gangsters and military men, Widmark actually loathed real-life gunplay, and he got involved in several gun-control initiatives and drives. In 1976, he famously stated:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-03-26/entertainment/17893302_1_tommy-udo-susan-blanchard-henry-hathaway |title=Actor Richard Widmark dies |author=David Hinckley |date=March 26, 2008 |work=New York Daily News |accessdate=April 12, 2011}}</ref>
{{quote|"I know I've made kind of a half-assed career out of violence, but I abhor violence. I am an ardent supporter of gun control. It seems incredible to me that the United States are the only civilized nation that does not put some effective control on guns."}}

Having retired in 2001, Widmark died, after a long illness, on March 24, 2008, at his home in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]] at the age of 93. Widmark's illness had been aggravated by a fall he had suffered during the previous year. At the 2009 Academy Awards, Richard Widmark was honored in the Memorial Tribute. His interment was at Roxbury's cemetery.
