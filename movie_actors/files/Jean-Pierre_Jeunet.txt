==Life and career==
Jean-Pierre Jeunet was born in [[Roanne]], Loire, France. He bought his first camera at the age of 17 and made short films while studying animation at [[Cinémation Studios]]. He befriended [[Marc Caro]], a designer and comic book artist who became his longtime collaborator and co-director.

Together, Jeunet and Caro directed award-winning animations. Their first live action film was ''[[The Bunker of the Last Gunshots]]'' (1981), a short film about soldiers in a bleak futuristic world. Jeunet also directed numerous advertisements and music videos, such as [[Jean Michel Jarre]]'s ''[[Zoolook]]'' (together with Caro).

Jeunet and Caro's first feature film was ''[[Delicatessen (film)|Delicatessen]]'' (1991), a melancholy [[black comedy|comedy]] set in a [[famine]]-plagued post-apocalyptic world, in which an apartment building above a delicatessen is ruled by a butcher who kills people in order to feed his tenants.<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0CEEDF1538F936A35753C1A967958260 The New York Times]</ref>

They next made ''[[The City of Lost Children]]'' (1995), a dark, multi-layered [[fantasy film]] about a mad scientist who steals children's dreams so that he can live indefinitely.<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B02E0DD1739F936A25751C1A963958260 The New York Times]</ref> The success of ''The City of Lost Children'' led to an invitation to direct the fourth movie in the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' series, ''[[Alien: Resurrection]]'' (1997).<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9400EED6163AF935A15752C1A961958260 The New York Times]</ref>

Jeunet directed ''[[Amélie]]'' (2001), starring [[Audrey Tautou]].<ref name=A/> ''Amélie'' continued the surrealist vibe of his earlier films, but was happier in tone and added romantic and comedic elements. This story, about a woman who takes pleasure in doing good deeds but has trouble finding love herself, was a huge critical and commercial success worldwide and was nominated for several [[Academy Awards]]. For this film, Jeunet also gained a [[European Film Awards|European Film Award]] for Best Director.

In 2004, Jeunet released ''[[A Very Long Engagement]]'', an adaptation of the novel by [[Sébastien Japrisot]].  The film, starring Audrey Tautou and [[Jodie Foster]], chronicled a woman's search for her missing lover after [[World War I]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/26/movies/26enga.html The New York Times]</ref>

In 2009, he released ''[[Micmacs (film)|Micmacs]]''.<ref name=MM/>

Jeunet has also directed numerous commercials including a 2'25" film for [[Chanel N° 5]] featuring his frequent collaborator Audrey Tautou.

In 2013, Jeunet released ''[[The Young and Prodigious T.S. Spivet]]'' an adaptation of [[Reif Larsen]]'s book: ''[[The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet]]'' that starred Kyle Catlett. The film was shot in English at various locations in Canada and in Washington, DC. It was released in 3D.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981107/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_1</ref>
