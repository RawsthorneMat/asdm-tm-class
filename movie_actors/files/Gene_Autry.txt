'''Orvon Grover Autry'''<ref>{{harvnb|George-Warren|2007|p=13}}</ref> (September 29, 1907 – October 2, 1998), better known as '''Gene Autry''', was an American performer who gained fame as a [[singing cowboy]] on the [[Radio in the United States|radio]], in [[Cinema of the United States|movies]], and on [[Television in the United States|television]] for more than three decades beginning in the early 1930s. Autry was also owner of a television station, several radio stations in Southern California, and the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles/California/Anaheim Angels]] Major League Baseball team from 1961 to 1997.

From 1934 to 1953, Autry appeared in 93 films and 91 episodes of ''[[The Gene Autry Show]]'' television series. During the 1930s and 1940s, he personified the straight-shooting hero—honest, brave, and true—and profoundly touched the lives of millions of Americans.<ref name="cusic">{{harvnb|Cusic|2010|page=1}}</ref> Autry was also one of the most important figures in the history of country music, considered the second major influential artist of the genre's development after [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].<ref name="cusic"/> His singing cowboy movies were the first vehicle to carry country music to a national audience.<ref name="cusic"/> In addition to his signature song, "[[Back in the Saddle Again]]", Autry is still remembered for his [[Christmas music|Christmas holiday songs]], "[[Here Comes Santa Claus]]", which he wrote, "[[Frosty the Snowman]]", and his biggest hit, "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]".

Autry is a member of both the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and is the only person to be awarded stars in all five categories on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], for film, television, music, radio, and live performance.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news|title=About Hollywood Star Walk |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date= |url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/#most-stars |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}</ref> The town of [[Gene Autry, Oklahoma]] was named in his honor.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19701015&id=XzIaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VSgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7216,2930074&hl=en | title=From Sleepy Eye to Chicken Bristle, USA | work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] | date=October 15, 1970 | accessdate=April 22, 2015 | author=Scriba, Jay}}</ref>

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Orvon Grover Autry was born September 29, 1907 near [[Tioga, Texas|Tioga]] in [[Grayson County, Texas|Grayson County]] in north [[Texas]], the grandson of a [[Methodism|Methodist]] preacher. His parents, Delbert Autry and Elnora Ozment, moved in the 1920s to [[Ravia, Oklahoma|Ravia]] in [[Johnston County, Oklahoma|Johnston County]] in southern [[Oklahoma]]. He worked on his father's ranch while at school. After leaving high school in 1925, Autry worked as a [[telegrapher]] for the [[St. Louis–San Francisco Railway]]. His talent at singing and playing guitar led to performing at local dances.

===Singing career===
[[File:Vlcsnap-2011-01-24-17h29m05s104.png|thumb|With [[Smiley Burnette]], 1934]]
While working as a telegrapher, Autry would sing and accompany himself on the guitar to pass the lonely hours, especially when he had the midnight shift. This later got him sacked. One night he was encouraged to sing professionally by a customer, the famous humorist [[Will Rogers]], who had heard Autry singing.<ref name="delong">{{cite book|last=DeLong |first=Thomas A. |title=The Mighty Music Box: The Golden Age of Musical Radio |publisher=Amber Crest Books |location=Los Angeles |year=1980 |isbn=978-0865330009}}</ref><ref name="smith">{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Ardis |title=Autry, First Cowboy of Land, Makes $300,000 Annually |newspaper=Buffalo New York News |date=November 13, 1940 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref name="encyclopedia-ok">{{cite web|last=Dabney |first=Eric |title=Orvon Gene Autry (1907–1998) |publisher=''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/A/AU004.html |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}</ref>

As soon as he could collect money to travel, he went to New York. He auditioned for [[Victor Records]], at just about the time (end of 1928) it became RCA Victor. According to [[Nathaniel Shilkret]],<ref>Shilkret, Nathaniel, ed. Niel Shell and Barbara Shilkret, Nathaniel Shilkret: Sixty Years in the Music Business, Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Md., 2005. ISBN 0-8108-5128-8.</ref> director of Light Music for Victor at the time, Autry asked to speak to Shilkret when Autry found that he had been turned down. Shilkret explained to Autry that he was turned down not because of his voice, but because Victor had just made contracts with two similar singers. Autry left with a letter of introduction from Shilkret and the advice to sing on radio to gain experience and to come back in a year or two. In 1928, Autry was singing on Tulsa's radio station KVOO as "Oklahoma's Yodeling Cowboy," and the Victor archives<ref>Victor Recording Book, p.&nbsp;7247. (This is a page from Victor's daily log of recordings.)</ref> show an October 9, 1929, entry stating that the vocal duet of Jimmie Long and Gene Autry with two Hawaiian guitars, directed by L. L. Watson, recorded "My Dreaming of You" (Matrix 56761) and "My Alabama" (Matrix 56762).

Autry signed a recording deal with [[Columbia Records]] in 1929. He worked in [[Chicago, Illinois]], on the [[WLS (AM)|WLS-AM]] radio show ''[[National Barn Dance]]'' for four years, and with his own show, where he met singer-songwriter [[Smiley Burnette]]. In his early recording career, Autry covered various genres, including a labor song, "The Death of [[Mary Harris Jones|Mother Jones]]" in 1931.

Autry also recorded many "[[hillbilly]]"-style records in 1930 and 1931 in New York City, which were certainly different in style and content from his later recordings. These were much closer in style to the Prairie Ramblers or [[Dick Justice (singer)|Dick Justice]], and included the "Do Right, Daddy Blues" and "Black Bottom Blues," both similar to "Deep Elem Blues." These late-Prohibition era songs deal with bootlegging, corrupt police, and women whose occupation was certainly vice. These recordings are generally not heard today but are available on European import labels, such as JSP Records.

His first hit was in 1932 with "[[That Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine]]," a duet with fellow railroad man, Jimmy Long, and which Autry and Long co-wrote.

Autry also sang the classic [[Raymond Otis Whitley|Ray Whitley]] hit "[[Back in the Saddle Again]]",<ref name=pc9>{{Gilliland |url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19757/m1/ |title=Show 9 – Tennessee Firebird: American country music before and after Elvis. [Part 1] }}</ref> as well as many Christmas holiday songs, including "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town," his own composition "Here Comes Santa Claus," "Frosty the Snowman," and his biggest hit, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." He wrote "Here Comes Santa Claus" after being the Grand Marshal of the 1946 Santa Claus Lane Parade (Now the Hollywood Christmas Parade). He heard all of the spectators watching the parade saying "Here comes Santa Claus!" virtually handing him the title for his song. He recorded his version of the song in 1947 and it became an instant classic.

Autry was the original owner of [[Challenge Records (1950s)|Challenge Records]]. The label's biggest hit was "Tequila" by [[The Champs]] in 1958, which started the rock-and-roll instrumental craze of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He sold the label soon after, but the maroon and later green label has the "GA" in a shield above the label name.

Autry made 640 recordings, including more than 300 songs written or co-written by himself. His records sold more than 100 million copies and he has more than a dozen gold and platinum records, including the first record ever certified gold.

===Film career===
[[File:Gene Autry in Oh, Susanna!.png|right|thumb|Gene Autry in ''[[Oh, Susanna! (1936 film)|Oh, Susanna!]]'', 1936]]
Discovered by film producer [[Nat Levine]] in 1934, Autry and Burnette made their film debut for [[Mascot Pictures]] Corp. in ''[[In Old Santa Fe]]'' as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part [[Serial (film)|serial]] ''[[The Phantom Empire]].'' Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the newly formed [[Republic Pictures|Republic Pictures Corp.]] and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all [[B-movie|B]] [[western (genre)|Westerns]] in which he played under his own name, rode his horse, Champion, had Burnette as his regular [[sidekick]], and had many opportunities to sing in each film. [[Pat Buttram]] was picked by Gene Autry, recently returned from his [[World War II]] service in the [[United States Army Air Forces]], to work with him. Buttram would co-star with Gene Autry in more than 40 films and in over 100 episodes of Autry's television show

[[File:GeneAutry.jpg|left|thumb|Gene Autry in ''[[The Gene Autry Show]]'' episode "The Black Rider," 1950]]
In the ''Motion Picture Herald'' Top Ten Money-Making Western Stars poll Autry was listed every year from 1936 to 1942 and 1946 to 1954 (he was serving in the AAF 1943–45), holding first place 1937 to 1942, and second place (after [[Roy Rogers]]) 1947 to 1954.<ref>Phil Hardy ''The Encyclopedia of Western Movies,'' [[Octopus|London]], Octopus, 1985, ISBN 0-8300-0405-X</ref> He appeared in the similar ''Box Office'' poll from 1936 to 1955, holding first place from 1936 to 1942 and second place (after Rogers) from 1943 to 1952.<ref name="bwesterns">{{cite web|title=Quigley Publishing Top Ten MoneyMakers Poll |publisher=''B Westerns'' |url=http://www.b-westerns.com/terms5.htm |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}</ref> While these two polls are really an indication only of the popularity of series stars, Autry also appeared in the ''Top Ten Money Makers Poll'' of all films from 1940 to 1942,<ref name="quigley">{{cite web|title=Top Ten Money Making Stars |publisher=''Quigley Publishing'' |url=http://www.quigleypublishing.com/MPalmanac/Top10/Top10_lists.html |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}</ref> His ''Gene Autry Flying "A" Ranch Rodeo'' show debuted in 1940.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|title=Gene Autry |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000810/ |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}</ref>

Gene Autry was the first of the singing cowboys in films, but was succeeded as the top star by [[Roy Rogers]] while Autry served in the AAF during World War II. He briefly returned to Republic to finish out his contract, which had been suspended for the duration of his military service and which he had tried to have declared void after his discharge. He appeared in 1951 in the film ''Texans Never Cry,'' with a role for newcomer [[Mary Castle]]. After 1951 Autry formed his own production company to make Westerns under his own control, which continued the 1947 distribution agreement with [[Columbia Pictures]].

====Melody Ranch====
Autry purchased the 110 acre [[Movie ranches#Monogram Ranch – Melody Ranch|Monogram Movie Ranch]] in 1953, located in [[Placerita Canyon State Park|Placerita Canyon]] near [[Newhall, California]] in the northern [[San Gabriel Mountains]] foothills. He renamed it the Melody Ranch after his movie ''[[Melody Ranch]].''<ref>http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sg032903.htm "Movie Magic in Placerita Canyon" www.scvhistory(society). Melody Ranch history. access date: May 15, 2010</ref> Autry then sold 98 acres of the property, most of the original ranch. The [[Western (genre)|Western]] town, [[adobe]]s, and ranch cabin [[Set construction|sets]] and open land for [[location shooting]] were retained as a movie ranch on 12 acres. A decade after he purchased Melody Ranch, a [[wildfire|brushfire]] swept through in August 1962, destroying most of the original standing sets. However, the devastated landscape did prove useful for productions such as ''[[Combat!]].'' A complete adobe ranch survived at the northeast section of the ranch.<ref>http://employees.oxy.edu/jerry//melody.htm oxy.edu.

In 1990, after his favorite horse Champion, who lived in retirement there, died, Autry put the remaining 12 acre ranch up for sale. It is now known as the Melody Ranch Motion Picture Studio and Melody Ranch Studios on 22 acres.<ref>http://www.melodyranchstudio.com/ www.melodyranchstudio. 'Melody Ranch Motion Picture Studio.' access date: May 15, 2010</ref> The ranch has Melody Ranch Museum open year-round; and one weekend a year the entire ranch is open to the public during the Cowboy Poetry & Music Festival, another legacy of Autry's multi-talents.<ref>http://www.melodyranchstudio.com/museum.html www.melodyranchstudio.

===Radio and television career===
[[File:Gene Autry Pinafores radio show 1948.JPG|right|thumb|Gene Autry with the Pinafores, who sang on his weekly radio show, 1948]]
From 1940 to 1956, Autry had a huge hit with a [[Gene Autry's Melody Ranch|weekly show]] on [[CBS Radio]], ''[[Gene Autry's Melody Ranch]].'' His horse, Champion, also had a CBS-TV and [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]] radio series, ''[[The Adventures of Champion]]''. In response to his many young radio listeners aspiring to emulate him, Autry created the Cowboy Code, or Ten Cowboy Commandments. These tenets promoting an ethical, moral, and patriotic lifestyle that appealed to youth organizations such as the Boy Scouts, which developed similar doctrines. The Cowboy Code consisted of rules that were "a natural progression of Gene's philosophies going back to his first ''[[Gene Autry's Melody Ranch|Melody Ranch]]'' programs—and early pictures."<ref name="george-256">{{harvnb|George-Warren|2007|p=256}}</ref> According to the code:
# The Cowboy must never shoot first, hit a smaller man, or take unfair advantage.
# He must never go back on his word, or a trust confided in him.
# He must always tell the truth.
# He must be gentle with children, the elderly, and animals.
# He must not advocate or possess racially or religiously intolerant ideas.
# He must help people in distress.
# He must be a good worker.
# He must keep himself clean in thought, speech, action, and personal habits.
# He must respect women, parents, and his nation's laws.
# The Cowboy is a patriot.

Beginning in 1950, he produced and starred in his own television show on [[CBS]] through his [[Flying A Productions]] studio and made several appearances on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Jubilee USA]]'' in the late 1950s. In 1995, Autry costarred with [[Charlton Heston]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Deborah Winters]] and [[Peter Graves]] in the [[Warren Chaney]] [[docudrama]], ''[[America: A Call to Greatness]]''.<ref name="imdb-america">{{cite web|title=America: A Call to Greatness |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1838449/ |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}</ref>

===Military career===
During [[World War II]] Autry enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in 1942 and became a [[technical sergeant|tech sergeant]] in the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. Holding a private pilot's license, he was determined to become an aviator and earned his [[Auxiliary Pilot Badge|service pilot rating]] in June 1944, serving as a [[Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express|C-109]] transport pilot with the rank of [[flight officer]]. Assigned to a unit of the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]], he flew as part of the dangerous airlift operation over the [[Himalayas]] between [[India]] and China, nicknamed [[the Hump]].<ref>[http://www.geneautry.com/geneautry/geneautry_flightofficer.html Gene Autry as flight officer]</ref><ref>{{cite journal|magazine=AOPA Pilot|date=May 2014|page=79|title=A Plane-Crazy America}}</ref>

===Rodeo===
[[File:Gene Autry and Gail Davis Toronto.jpg|right|thumb|Gene Autry and [[Gail Davis]] in Toronto, circa 1955.]]
Few are aware of Autry's longtime involvement in professional rodeo. In 1942 Autry, at the height of his screen popularity, had a string of rodeo stock based in Ardmore, Oklahoma. A year later he became a partner in the World Championship Rodeo Company, which furnished livestock for many of the country's major rodeos. In 1954 he acquired Montana's top bucking string from the estate of Leo J. Cremer, Sr. and put Canadian saddle bronc riding champion Harry Knight in charge of the operation. A merger with the World Championship Rodeo Company in 1956 made Autry the sole owner. He moved the entire company to a {{convert|24000|acre|km2|adj=on}} ranch near Fowler, Colorado, with Knight as the working partner in the operation. For the next 12 years, they provided livestock for most of the major rodeos in Texas, Colorado, Montana and Nebraska. When the company was sold in 1968, both men continued to be active in rodeo. For his work as a livestock contractor Autry was inducted into the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]]'s [[ProRodeo Hall of Fame]] in 1979.

===Retirement===
Autry retired from show business in 1964, having made almost 100 films up to 1955 and over 600 records. He was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1969 and to the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1970. After retiring, he invested widely and in real estate, radio, and television. He also invested in ownership of the KOOL-TV CBS-affiliate in Phoenix, Arizona which created local shows such as the weekly bilingual children's show "Ninos Contentos." He also purchased the rights from the dying Republic Pictures for films he had made for the company.

In 1952, Autry bought the old Monogram Ranch in Placerita Canyon (Newhall-[[Santa Clarita, California|Santa Clarita]], California,) and renamed it Melody Ranch. Numerous "B" Westerns and TV shows were shot there during Autry's ownership, including the initial years of ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' with [[James Arness]]. Melody Ranch burned down in 1962, dashing Autry's plans to turn it into a museum. According to a published story by Autry the fire caused him to turn his attention to [[Griffith Park]], where he would build his Museum of Western Heritage (now known as the [[Autry National Center]]). Melody Ranch came back to life after 1991, when it was purchased by the Veluzat family and rebuilt. It survives as a movie location today as well as the home of the City of Santa Clarita's annual Cowboy Festival, where Autry's legacy takes center stage.

===Baseball===
[[File:AngelsRetired26.png|right|thumb|150px|Gene Autry's number 26 was retired by the [[California Angels]] in 1992.]]
In the 1950s, Autry had been a minority owner of the minor-league [[Hollywood Stars]]. In 1960, when [[Major League Baseball]] announced plans to add an expansion team in Los Angeles, Autry—who had once declined an opportunity to play in the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]]—expressed an interest in acquiring the radio broadcast rights to the team's games. Baseball executives were so impressed by his approach that he was persuaded to become the owner of the franchise rather than simply its broadcast partner. The team, initially called the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels]] upon its 1961 debut, moved to suburban [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] in 1966, and was renamed the California Angels, then the Anaheim Angels from 1997 until 2005, when it became the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Autry served as vice president of the [[American League]] from 1983 until his death. In 1995 he sold a quarter share of the team to [[The Walt Disney Company]] and a controlling interest the following year, with the remaining share to be transferred after his death. Earlier, in 1982, he sold Los Angeles television station [[KTLA]] for $245&nbsp;million.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} He also sold several radio stations he owned, including [[KSFO]] in San Francisco, [[KMPC]] in Los Angeles, [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO]] in San Diego, and other stations in the [[Golden West radio network]].

The number 26 (as in 26th man) was retired by the Angels in Autry's honor. The chosen number reflected that baseball's rosters are 25-man strong, so Autry's unflagging support for his team made him the 26th member.

===Death===
[[File:Gene Autry Grave.JPG|thumb|Grave of Gene Autry, at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills.]]

Gene Autry died of [[lymphoma]] on October 2, 1998, aged 91 at his home in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City, California]]. He was buried at the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{Find a Grave|3739}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1932, Autry married Ina May Spivey, the niece of Jimmy Long. After she died in 1980, he married [[Jackie Autry|Jacqueline Ellam]], who had been his banker, in 1981. He had no children by either marriage.

Autry, was raised into Freemasonry in 1927 at Catoosa Lodge No.&nbsp;185, Catoosa Oklahoma. He later became a 33rd degree Master Mason, as recorded on his headstone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Autry|first=Gene|title=Grand Lodge of BC and the Yukon|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/autry_g/autry_g.html|work=Masonic Research|publisher=freemasonry.bcy.ca|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref>

==Legacy==
On November 16, 1941, the town of [[Gene Autry, Oklahoma|Berwyn, Oklahoma]], north of [[Ardmore, Oklahoma|Ardmore]], was renamed in honor of Gene Autry.<ref name="OHOF">[http://www.oklahomaheritage.com/Portals/0/docs/Gene%20Autry.pdf Oklahoma Heritage Association. "Oklahoma Hall of Fame: Gene Autry."]</ref>

In 1972, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. Autry was a life member of the [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks]], Burbank Lodge No.&nbsp;1497. His 1976 autobiography, co-written by Mickey Herskowitz, was titled ''Back in the Saddle Again'' after his 1939 hit and signature tune. He is also featured year after year, on radio and "shopping mall music" at the holiday season, by his recording of "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]." "Rudolph" became the first No.&nbsp;1 hit of the 1950s. [[Country Music Television|CMT]] in 2003 ranked him No.&nbsp;38 in ''[[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s [[40 Greatest Men of Country Music]].''

When the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] won their first [[2002 World Series|World Series]] in 2002, much of the championship was dedicated to him. The interchange of [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 134|State Route 134]], located near the [[Museum of the American West|Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, is signed as the "Gene Autry Memorial Interchange." In 2007, he became a charter member of the [[Gennett Records]] Walk of Fame in [[Richmond, Indiana]].

[[Johnny Cash]] recorded a song in 1978 about Autry called "Who is Gene Autry?" Cash also got Autry to sign his famous black [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] D-35 guitar, which he plays in the video of "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)#Johnny Cash's cover|Hurt]]."{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 1977, Autry was awarded the American Patriots Medal by [[Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge|Freedoms Foundation]] of [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania|Valley Forge]], Pennsylvania. Other winners of this medal were [[Helen Hayes]], [[John Wayne]], and [[Texas House of Representatives|Texas State Representative]] [[Clay Smothers]].<ref name=medal>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legeLeaders/members/memberDisplay.cfm?memberID=587&searchparams=chamber=~city=~countyID=0~RcountyID=~district=~first=~gender=~last=Smothers~leaderNote=~leg=~party=~roleDesc=~Committee=#bio|title=66th Legislature, Resolutions – Congratulatory and Honorary|publisher=lrl.state.tx.us|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref>

Autry was inducted into the [[Radio Hall of Fame]] in 2003. In 2004, the Starz Entertainment Corporation joined forces with the Autry estate to restore all of his films, which have been shown on Starz's Encore Western Channel on cable television on a regular basis to date since.

Autry was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Hall of Fame]] in 1991.<ref name="OHOF"/>

===The Museum of the American West===
The [[Museum of the American West]] in Los Angeles' [[Griffith Park]] was founded in 1988 as the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, featuring much of his collection of Western art and memorabilia. It is now called The Autry National Center and is divided into two locations, eight miles apart from each other. Its mission is to present the unique and diverse perspectives of the American West, including the romanticized West in pop culture and the "real" nuanced history, including native and minority voices.
