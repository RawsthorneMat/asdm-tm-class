'''Barton MacLane''' (December 25, 1902 &ndash; January 1, 1969) was an [[United States|American]] actor, playwright, and screenwriter. Although he appeared in many classic films from the 1930s through the 1960s, he was known for his role as Gen. Martin Peterson on the 1960s [[NBC]] television [[comedy series]] ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', with [[Barbara Eden]] and [[Larry Hagman]].

==Career==
MacLane was born in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], [[South Carolina]] on Christmas Day, 1902. He attended [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], [[Connecticut]], where he excelled at [[American football]]. His first movie role, in ''The Quarterback'' (1926), was a result of his athletic ability. He then attended the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]].

He made his [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] debut in 1927, playing the assistant district attorney in Bayard Veiller's ''[[The Trial of Mary Dugan]]''. He then performed in the 1928 Broadway production of ''[[Gods of the Lighting]]'' and was part of the original cast of ''[[Subway Express]]'' as Officer Mulvaney in 1929. He appeared in the [[Marx Brothers]]' 1929 film debut ''[[The Cocoanuts]]''. MacLane made his first credited film appearance in the 1931 romantic drama ''[[His Woman]]''. The following year, he wrote the play ''[[Rendezvous (play)|Rendezvous]]'', which he sold to [[Arthur Hopkins]]. The play was performed on Broadway, with MacLane in a featured role. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Film work: 1930s-1950s===

The success of ''Rendezvous'' landed MacLane a contract with [[Warner Bros.]] and brought him to the attention of several renowned film directors, including [[Fritz Lang]], [[Michael Curtiz]], and [[William Keighley]]. As a result, throughout the remainder of the 1930s, MacLane was highly active in film, with major supporting roles in such productions as ''[[The Case of the Curious Bride]]'', ''[[G Men]]'', ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1937 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'', and Lang's ''[[You Only Live Once (film)|You Only Live Once]]'' and ''[[You and Me (1938 film)|You and Me]]''. He also played the role of detective [[Torchy Blane|Steve McBride]] in the many films involving fictional news reporter [[Torchy Blane]].

During the 1930s and 1940s, MacLane worked alongside legendary movie star [[Humphrey Bogart]] in several films. Perhaps most notably, MacLane played Lieutenant Dundy opposite Bogart's [[Sam Spade]] in writer/director [[John Huston]]'s acclaimed, [[Academy Award]]-nominated film classic, ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. MacLane again collaborated with both Bogart and Huston on the Academy Award-winning 1948 adventure film ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]''.

MacLane's many other film credits during the 1940s include ''[[The Big Street]]'', [[Victor Fleming]]'s ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'', Fritz Lang's ''[[Western Union (film)|Western Union]]'', [[Reginald Le Borg]]'s ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'', and [[Frank Borzage]]'s ''[[The Spanish Main]]''. He also appeared in two ''[[Tarzan]]'' films starring [[Johnny Weismuller]], ''[[Tarzan and the Amazons]]'' and ''[[Tarzan and the Huntress]]''. Some of MacLane's films during the 1950s include ''[[Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (film)|Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye]]'', ''[[The Glenn Miller Story]]'', and ''[[Three Violent People]]''.

As he was the regular heavy and bad guy, juveniles started using the term "Don't give me that Barton MacLane", if they felt justly or unjustly being turned off by adults or authorities, e.g. cops, teachers and so on.

===Television and final films===
In the 1950s, MacLane began to appear regularly on television. Between 1953 and 1967, he guest starred on such programs as ''[[Conflict (TV series)|Conflict]]'', ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]'', ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]]'', ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'', ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.  In 1958 he played Sen. Harriman Baylor in the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode, "The Case of the Foot-Loose Doll." In 1960 he played Eugene Norris, Perry's friend and small-town sheriff, in "The Case of the Violent Village."

During the 1960-1961 [[television season]], MacLane was a series regular on twenty-seven episodes of NBC's  [[Western (genre)|western]], ''[[Outlaws (1960 TV series)|Outlaws]]'', in which he played Marshal Frank Caine. His costars were [[Don Collier]] and [[Jock Gaynor]]. He made his last film appearance in [[Frank Capra]]'s Academy Award-nominated 1961 comedy ''[[Pocketful of Miracles]]''.

MacLane was cast in 1965 in the recurring role of General Martin Peterson on ''I Dream of Jeannie''. He appeared in thirty-five episodes of the series between 1965 and 1969. Three of MacLane's episodes were aired after his death. His character was replaced on later episodes of that show by Gen. Winfield Schaeffer, played by [[Vinton Hayworth]], who died the following year. Hayworth also died before all episodes featuring his character had aired.

==Death==
MacLane died of [[double pneumonia]] on New Year's Day, 1969 in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[California]].<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fVVQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lFcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4378,287185&dq=barton+maclane+dead&hl=en Movie Bad Guy, Barton Maclane, Dead at 66]</ref>  He was buried in [[Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery]]. For his contribution to the television industry, Barton MacLane has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6719 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

==Personal==
Maclane played several musical instruments, including the violin, piano, and guitar. In 1939, MacLane married actress Charlotte Wynters. From the 1940s until his death, he maintained a cattle [[ranch]] in eastern [[Madera County, California|Madera County]], California, where he made his home when he was not acting.
