==Biography==
Gopalakrishnan was born on 3 July 1941 in the village of Pallickal [http://wikimapia.org/31200983/Medayil-Bungalow-Pallickal ( Medayil Bungalow )] near [[Adoor]], present day [[Kerala]], India as the son of Madhavan Unnithan and Mouttathu Gauri Kunjamma. He started his artistic life as an actor in amateur plays when he was 8. Later he shifted his base to writing and direction and wrote and directed a few plays. After securing a degree in Economics, Political Science and Public Administration in 1961 from the [[Gandhigram Rural Institute]],<ref>{{cite web | last = | first =| title = Page on Adoor Gopalakrishnan at Kerala tourism | url=http://www.keralatourism.org/index.php?zone=4&menu=59&id=21| accessdate = 8 February 2008 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> he worked as a Government officer near [[Dindigul]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] . In 1962, he left his job to study screenwriting and direction from the [[Pune Film Institute]]. He completed his course from there with a scholarship from the [[Government of India]]. With his classmates and friends, Adoor established ''Chithralekha Film Society and Chalachithra Sahakarana Sangham''; the organization was the first film society in Kerala and it aimed at production, distribution and exhibition of films in the co-operative sector.

Adoor has scripted and directed eleven feature films and about thirty short films and documentaries. Notable amongst the non-feature films are those on Kerala’s performing arts.
[[File:Adoor Gopalakrishnan 1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Malayalm cinema director Adoor Ghopalakrishnan while he attending Sharjah Book Fair 2013 programme]]
Adoor's debut film, the national award winning ''[[Swayamvaram]]'' (1972) was a milestone in [[Malayalam film]] history. The film was exhibited widely in various international film festivals including those held in Moscow, [[Melbourne]], London and Paris. The films that followed namely ''[[Kodiyettam]], [[Elippathayam]], [[Mukhamukham]], [[Anantaram]], ''[[Mathilukal (film)|Mathilukal]]'', [[Vidheyan]]'' and ''[[Kathapurushan]]'' lived up to the reputation of his first film and were well received by critics at various film festivals and fetched him many awards. However, ''Mukhamukham'' was criticized in Kerala while ''Vidheyan'' was at the centre of a debate due to the differences in opinion between the writer of story of the film Sakhariya and Adoor.

Adoor's later films are ''[[Nizhalkuthu]]'', narrating the experiences of an executioner who comes to know that one of his subjects was innocent, and ''[[Naalu Penungal]]'', a film adaptation of four short stories by [[Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai]].

All his films have won national and international awards (National award for best film twice, best director five times, and best script two times. His films have also won his actors and technicians several national awards). Adoor’s third feature, ''[[Elippathayam]]'' won him the coveted British Film Institute Award for 'the most original and imaginative film' of 1982. The International Film Critics Prize (FIPRESCI) has gone to him six times successively for ''Mukhamukham, Anantharam, Mathilukal, Vidheyan, Kathapurushan'' and ''Nizhalkkuthu''. Winner of several international awards like the UNICEF film prize (Venice), [[OCIC]] film prize (Amiens), INTERFILM Prize (Mannheim) etc., his films have been shown in [[Cannes]], [[Venice]], [[Berlin]], [[Toronto]], [[London]], [[Rotterdam]] and every important festival around the world.

In consideration of his contribution to Indian cinema, the nation honoured him with the title of [[Padma Shri]](India's fourth highest civilian award) in 1984 and [[Padma Vibhushan]](India's second highest civilian award) in 2006.

Adoor is settled in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] (Trivandrum) in Kerala. His daughter [[Aswathi Dorje]] is an [[Indian Police Service|IPS]] officer (part of the Assam cadre, 2000 batch), currently acting as Deputy Commissioners of Police in [[Mumbai]] since June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author=A correspondent Date:  2010-06-02 Place: Mumbai |url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2010/jun/020610-mumbai-dcp-husband-wife-chhering-dorje-aswati.htm |title=Husband-wife set to take charge as Mumbai's DCPs |publisher=Mid-day.com |date=2 June 2010 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1050123/asp/look/story_4279220.asp | location=Calcutta, India | work=The Telegraph | title=Crimebusters | date=23 January 2005}}</ref>

==Documentaries and 'New Cinema' movement==
[[File:Adoor gopalakrishnan.jpg|thumb|right|Adoor standing next to his portrait]]
Apart from nine feature films, he has over 30 short films and documentaries to his credit. The [[Helsinki Film Festival]] was the first film festival to have a retrospective of his films. He has headed the jury at the National Film Awards and many international film festivals.

Apart from his films, Adoor's major contribution towards introducing a new cinema culture in Kerala was the constitution of the first Film Society in Kerala, "Chitralekha Film Society". He also took active part in the constitution of "Chitralekha," Kerala's first Film Co-operative Society for film production. These movements triggered a fresh wave of films, called "art films," by directors like G Aravindan, PA Becker, KG George, Pavithran, and Raveendran. At a time this movement was so strong that even popular cinema synthesised with art cinema to create a new genre of films.Bharat Gopi starred as hero 4 times in his ventures.

==Style and trademarks==

Adoor has been known as a director who completely dictates every fine detail of his films. On the performance of actors in his movies, he stated that - "It is not the artist's job to do the detailing. I do not want different interpretations of roles that may clash with each other. It has to be absolutely unified." He normally does not encourage his crew to read the script or even the stories. The actors are told at the time of shooting about the role and the scenes before conducting several rehearsals. According to Adoor "[i]n movies, the actor is not performing to the audience like the stage actor. Here they are acting for me. I am the audience and I will decide whether it is correct or not, enough or not." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adoorgopalakrishnan.com/profile.htm|title='Naalu Pennungal' not complex like my other films: Adoor|accessdate=28 May 2009|publisher= [[Yahoo]] India Movies}}</ref>
