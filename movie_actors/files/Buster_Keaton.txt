'''Joseph Frank "Buster" Keaton''' (October 4, 1895 – February 1, 1966) was an American actor, [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]], comedian, filmmaker, stunt performer, and writer.<ref>Obituary ''[[Variety Obituaries|Variety]]'', February 2, 1966, page 63.</ref> He was best known for his [[silent film]]s, in which his trademark was [[physical comedy]] with a consistently [[stoicism|stoic]], [[deadpan]] expression, earning him the nickname "The Great Stone Face".<ref name="re">[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021110/REVIEWS08/40802001/1023 Roger Ebert: The Films of Buster Keaton].</ref>

Buster Keaton (his lifelong stage name) was recognized as the seventh-greatest director by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/directors2.html Greatest Film Directors and Their Best Films].</ref> In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Keaton the 21st-[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest male star]].<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.afi.com/100Years/stars.aspx | title = AFI Recognizes the 50 Greatest American Screen Legends | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | date = June 16, 1999  | accessdate = August 31, 2013 | archivedate = January 13, 2013 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20130113043532/http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx | deadurl =no}}</ref> Critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote of Keaton's "extraordinary period from 1920 to 1929, [when] he worked without interruption on a series of films that make him, arguably, the greatest actor-director in the history of the movies."<ref name="re"/> His career declined afterward with a dispiriting loss of his artistic independence when he was hired by [[MGM]], which resulted in a crippling alcoholism that ruined his family life. However, he recovered in the 1940s, remarried and revived his career to a degree as an honored comic performer for the rest of his life, earning an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1958.

[[Orson Welles]] stated that Keaton's ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]'' is "the greatest comedy ever made, the greatest Civil War film ever made, and perhaps the greatest film ever made."<ref>Orson Welles interview, from the Kino Nov 10, 2009 Blu-Ray edition of The General</ref> A 2002 worldwide poll by ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' ranked Keaton's ''The General'' as the 15th [[List of films considered the best|best film of all time]].

==Career==

===Early life in vaudeville===
Keaton was born '''Joseph Frank Keaton''' on October 4, 1895<ref name=Meade16>{{cite book |title=Buster Keaton: Cut to the Chase|last=Meade |first=Marion|year=1997|publisher=Da Capo |isbn=0-306-80802-1|page=16}}</ref> into a [[vaudeville]] family. He was named "Joseph" to continue a tradition on his father's side—he was sixth in a line bearing the name Joseph Keaton<ref name="Meade16" />—and "Frank" for his maternal grandfather, who disapproved of the parents' union. Later, Keaton changed his middle name to "Francis".<ref name=Meade16/> His father was [[Joe Keaton|Joseph Hallie "Joe" Keaton]], a native of [[Vigo County, Indiana]]. Joe Keaton owned a traveling show with [[Harry Houdini]] called the "Mohawk Indian Medicine Company", which performed on stage and sold [[patent medicine]] on the side. Buster Keaton was born in [[Piqua, Kansas]], the small town where his mother, [[Myra Keaton]] (née Myra Edith Cutler), happened to go into labor.<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Stokes |url=http://www.kansastravel.org/busterkeatonmuseum.htm |title=Buster Keaton Museum – Piqua, Kansas |publisher=Kansastravel.org |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}</ref>
[[File:Threekeatons.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Six-year-old Buster Keaton with his parents Myra and Joe Keaton during a vaudeville act]]

According to a frequently repeated story, which may be apocryphal,<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=161352 Turner Classic Movies website].</ref> Keaton acquired the nickname "Buster" at about eighteen months of age. Keaton told interviewer [[Fletcher Markle]] that  Houdini happened to be present one day when the young Keaton took a tumble down a long flight of stairs without injury. After the infant sat up and shook off his experience, Houdini remarked, "That was a real buster!" According to Keaton, in those days, the word "buster" was used to refer to a spill or a fall that had the potential to produce injury. After this, it was Keaton's father who began to use the nickname to refer to the youngster. Keaton retold the anecdote over the years, including a 1964 interview with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s ''[[Telescope (TV series)|Telescope]]''.<ref>''Telescope: Deadpan an interview with Buster Keaton'', 1964 interview of Buster and Eleanor Keaton by [[Fletcher Markle]] for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]].</ref>

At the age of three, Keaton began performing with his parents in ''The Three Keatons''. He first appeared on stage in 1899 in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. The act was mainly a comedy sketch. Myra played the saxophone to one side, while Joe and Buster performed on center stage. The young Keaton would goad his father by disobeying him, and the elder Keaton would respond by throwing him against the scenery, into the orchestra pit, or even into the audience. A suitcase handle was sewn into Keaton's clothing to aid with the constant tossing. The act evolved as Keaton learned to take trick falls safely; he was rarely injured or bruised on stage. This knockabout style of comedy led to accusations of [[child abuse]], and occasionally, arrest. However, Buster Keaton was always able to show the authorities that he had no bruises or broken bones. He was eventually billed as "The Little Boy Who Can't Be Damaged," with the overall act being advertised as "'The Roughest Act That Was Ever in the History of the Stage."<ref name="bk">{{cite web|url=http://www.busterkeaton.com/bio1.htm |title=PART I: A Vaudeville Childhood |publisher=Busterkeaton.com |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}</ref> Decades later, Keaton said that he was never hurt by his father and that the falls and physical comedy were a matter of proper technical execution. In 1914, Keaton told the ''[[Detroit News]]'':

<blockquote>The secret is in landing limp and breaking the fall with a foot or a hand. It's a knack. I started so young that landing right is second nature with me. Several times I'd have been killed if I hadn't been able to land like a cat. Imitators of our act don't last long, because they can't stand the treatment.<ref name="bk"/></blockquote>

Keaton claimed he was having so much fun that he would sometimes begin laughing as his father threw him across the stage. Noticing that this drew fewer laughs from the audience, he adopted his famous deadpan expression whenever he was working.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/02/keaton.html |title=Buster Keaton |publisher=Archive.sensesofcinema.com |date=February 1, 1966 |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}</ref>

The act ran up against laws banning child performers in vaudeville. According to one biographer, Keaton was made to go to school while performing in New York, but only attended for part of one day. Despite tangles with the law and a disastrous tour of [[music hall]]s in the United Kingdom, Keaton was a rising star in the theater. Keaton stated that he learned to read and write late, and was taught by his mother. By the time he was 21, his father's alcoholism threatened the reputation of the family act,<ref name="bk"/> so Keaton and his mother, Myra, left for New York, where Buster Keaton's career swiftly moved from vaudeville to film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.busterkeaton.com/partii.htm |title=PART II:The Flickers |publisher=Busterkeaton.com |date=October 13, 1924 |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}</ref> <!--Information taken from "Buster, A Legend In Laughter", by Larry Edwards-->

Keaton served in the [[United States Army]] in [[France]] with the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]] during [[World War I]].  His unit remained intact and was not broken up to provide replacements, as happened to some other late-arriving divisions.  During his time in uniform, he suffered an ear infection that permanently impaired his hearing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwar1.com/dbc/buster.htm |title=My Career at the Rear / Buster Keaton in World War I |author=Martha R. Jett |publisher=worldwar1.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/Keaton.html |title=Buster Keaton: Comedian, Soldier |author=Master Sergeant Jim Ober |publisher=[[California State Military Museum]]}}</ref>

===Silent film era===
In February 1917, Keaton met [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]] at the Talmadge Studios in New York City, where Arbuckle was under contract to [[Joseph Schenck|Joseph M. Schenck]]. Joe Keaton disapproved of films, and Buster also had reservations about the medium. During his first meeting with Arbuckle, he asked to borrow one of the cameras to get a feel for how it worked. He took the camera back to his hotel room, dismantled and reassembled it. With this rough understanding of the mechanics of the moving pictures, he returned the next day, camera in hand, asking for work. He was hired as a co-star and gag man, making his first appearance in ''[[The Butcher Boy (1917 film)|The Butcher Boy]]''. Keaton later claimed that he was soon Arbuckle's second director and his entire gag department. He appeared in a total of 14 Arbuckle shorts, running into 1920. They were popular and, contrary to Keaton's later reputation as "The Great Stone Face", he often smiled and even laughed in them. Keaton and Arbuckle became close friends, and Keaton was one of few people to defend Arbuckle's character during accusations that he was responsible for the death of actress [[Virginia Rappe]].<!-- Edwards says Arbuckle and Keaton met at Talmadge; the IMDB says "Butcher Boy" was made at Colony Studios in NYC -->

In 1920, ''[[The Saphead]]'' was released, in which Keaton had his first starring role in a full-length feature. It was based on a successful play, ''The New Henrietta'', which had already been filmed once, under the title ''The Lamb'', with [[Douglas Fairbanks]] playing the lead. Fairbanks recommended Keaton to take the role for the remake five years later, since the film was to have a comic slant.
[[File:Keaton Cops pt1.ogg|thumb|A clip from the beginning of ''Cops'']]
After Keaton's successful work with Arbuckle, Schenck gave him his own production unit, Buster Keaton Comedies. He made a series of two-reel comedies, including ''[[One Week (1920 film)|One Week]]'' (1920), ''[[The Playhouse (film)|The Playhouse]]'' (1921), ''[[Cops (1922)|Cops]]'' (1922), and ''[[The Electric House]]'' (1922). Keaton then moved to full-length features.

[[File:Keaton Convict 13 1920.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Movie poster for the 1920 film [[Convict 13]].]]

Keaton's writers included [[Clyde Bruckman]], Joseph Mitchell and Jean Havez, but the most ingenious gags were generally conceived by Keaton himself. Comedy director [[Leo McCarey]], recalling the freewheeling days of making [[slapstick]] comedies, said, "All of us tried to steal each other's gagmen. But we had no luck with Keaton, because he thought up his best gags himself and we couldn't steal ''him!''"<ref>Maltin, Leonard, The Great Movie Comedians, Bell Publishing, 1978</ref> The more adventurous ideas called for dangerous stunts, performed by Keaton at great physical risk. During the railroad water-tank scene in ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'', Keaton broke his neck when a torrent of water fell on him from a water tower, but he did not realize it until years afterward. A scene from ''[[Steamboat Bill Jr.]]'' required Keaton to run into the shot and stand still on a particular spot. Then, the facade of a two-story building toppled forward on top of Keaton. Keaton's character emerged unscathed, thanks to a single open window. The stunt required precision, because the prop house weighed two tons, and the window only offered a few inches of clearance around Keaton's body. The sequence furnished one of the most memorable images of his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/reviews/b/busterkeatondf.shtml |title=Reviews : The General/Steamboat Bill Jr |publisher=The DVD Journal |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}</ref>

Film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] later described Keaton's style of comedy: "Buster plainly is a man inclined towards a belief in nothing but mathematics and absurdity ... like a number that has always been searching for the right equation. Look at his face—as beautiful but as inhuman as a butterfly—and you see that utter failure to identify sentiment."<ref>Thomson, David, ''Have you Seen...?'', Alfred A. Knopf Publishing, 2008, p. 767.</ref> Gilberto Perez commented on "Keaton's genius as an actor to keep a face so nearly deadpan and yet render it, by subtle inflections, so vividly expressive of inner life. His large deep eyes are the most eloquent feature; with merely a stare he can convey a wide range of emotions, from longing to mistrust, from puzzlement to sorrow."<ref>Perez Gilberto 'The Material Ghost—On Keaton and Chaplin' 1998</ref> Critic [[Anthony Lane]] also noted Keaton's body language: "The traditional Buster stance requires that he remain upstanding, full of backbone, looking ahead... [in ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]''] he clambers onto the roof of his locomotive and leans gently forward to scan the terrain, with the breeze in his hair and adventure zipping toward him around the next bend.  it is the ''angle'' that you remember: the figure perfectly straight but tilted forward, like the Spirit of Ecstasy on the hood of a Rolls-Royce... [in ''[[The Three Ages]]''], he drives a low-grade automobile over a bump in the road, and the car just ''crumbles'' beneath him.  Rerun it on video, and you can see Buster riding the collapse like a surfer, hanging onto the steering wheel, coming beautifully to rest as the wave of wreckage breaks."<ref>Lane, Anthony, ''Nobody's Perfect'', Knopf Publishing, 2002, pgs. 560-561</ref>  Film historian [[Jeffrey Vance]] writes, “Buster Keaton’s comedy endures not just because he had a face that belongs on Mount Rushmore, at once hauntingly immovable and classically American, but because that face was attached to one of the most gifted actors and directors who ever graced the screen. Evolved from the knockabout upbringing of the vaudeville stage, Keaton’s comedy is a whirlwind of hilarious, technically precise, adroitly executes, and surprising gags, very often set against a backdrop of visually stunning set pieces and locations—all this masked behind his unflinching, stoic veneer.”<ref>Vance, Jeffrey. "Introduction." Keaton, Eleanor and Jeffrey Vance.  Buster Keaton Remembered. Harry N. Abrams, 2001, pg. 33. ISBN 0-8109-4227-5</ref> Keaton has inspired full academic study.<ref>Trahair, Lisa.

Aside from ''Steamboat Bill Jr.'' (1928), Keaton's most enduring feature-length films include ''[[Our Hospitality]]'' (1923), ''[[The Navigator (1924 film)|The Navigator]]'' (1924), ''[[Sherlock Jr.]]'' (1924), ''[[Seven Chances]]'' (1925), ''[[The Cameraman (1928 film)|The Cameraman]]'' (1928), and ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]'' (1927). ''The General'', set during the [[American Civil War]], combined physical comedy with Keaton's love of trains, including an epic locomotive chase. Employing picturesque locations, the film's storyline reenacted an [[Great Locomotive Chase|actual wartime incident]]. Though it would come to be regarded as Keaton's greatest achievement, the film received mixed reviews at the time. It was too dramatic for some filmgoers expecting a lightweight comedy, and reviewers questioned Keaton's judgment in making a comedic film about the Civil War, even while noting it had a "few laughs".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2006-11-10/article/25592?headline=Moving-Pictures-Buster-Keaton-s-General-Pulls-In-To-PFA |title=Moving Pictures: Buster Keaton’s ‘General’ Pulls In To PFA.

It was an expensive misfire, and Keaton was never entrusted with total control over his films again. His distributor, [[United Artists]], insisted on a production manager who monitored expenses and interfered with certain story elements. Keaton endured this treatment for two more feature films, and then exchanged his independent setup for employment at Hollywood's biggest studio, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM). Keaton's loss of independence as a filmmaker coincided with the coming of sound films (although he was interested in making the transition) and mounting personal problems, and his career in the early sound era was hurt as a result.<ref name="b-k">{{cite web|url=http://www.buster-keaton.com/ |title=Buster-Keaton.com |publisher=Buster-Keaton.com |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}</ref>

===Use of parody===
[[File:OutWest1918-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Roscoe Arbuckle]], Keaton and [[Al St. John]] in 1918]]
Keaton started experimenting with [[parody]] during his vaudeville years, where most frequently his performances involved impressions and burlesques of other performers' acts. Most of these parodies targeted acts with which Keaton had shared the bill.<ref name="p27">Knopf, Robert ''The Theater and Cinema of Buster Keaton'' By [http://books.google.com/books?id=fU5qDx7tawIC&pg=PA27 p.27]</ref> When Keaton transposed his experience in vaudeville to film, in many works he parodied melodramas.<ref name="p27"/> Other favorite targets were cinematic plots, structures and devices.<ref>Mast, Gerald (1979) ''The Comic Mind: Comedy and the Movies''[http://books.google.com/books?id=qVN2q13uHt0C&pg=PA135 p.135]</ref>

One of his most biting parodies is ''[[The Frozen North]]'' (1922), a satirical take on [[William S. Hart]]'s Western melodramas, like ''[[Hell's Hinges]]'' (1916) and ''The Narrow Trail'' (1917). Keaton parodied the tired formula of the melodramatic transformation from bad guy to good guy, through which went Hart's character, known as "the good badman".<ref name="Bal"/> He wears a small version of Hart's campaign hat from the Spanish–American War and a six-shooter on each thigh, and during the scene in which he shoots the neighbor and her husband, he reacts with thick glycerin tears, a trademark of Hart's.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VcVohkED9e4C&pg=PA23|title=Laurel & Hardy|work=google.com}}</ref> Audiences of the 1920s recognized the parody and thought the film hysterically funny. However, Hart himself was not amused by Keaton's antics, particularly the crying scene, and did not speak to Buster for two years after he had seen the film.<ref name="pp95">Keaton, Eleanor, and Vance, Jeffrey. Buster Keaton Remembered, H.N. Abrams, 2001, pp. 95</ref> The film's opening intertitles give it its mock-serious tone, and are taken from "[[The Shooting of Dan McGrew]]" by [[Robert W. Service]].<ref name="pp95"/>

In ''[[The Playhouse (film)|The Playhouse]]'' (1921), he parodied his contemporary [[Thomas H. Ince]], Hart's producer, who indulged in over-crediting himself in his film productions. The short also featured the impression of a performing monkey which was likely derived from a co-biller's act (called ''[[Peter the Great#Popular culture|Peter the Great]]'').<ref name="p27"/> ''[[Three Ages]]'' (1923), his first feature-length film, is a parody of [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), from which it replicates the three inter-cut shorts structure.<ref name="p27"/> ''Three Ages'' also featured parodies of Bible stories, like those of [[Samson]] and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]].<ref name="Bal">Balducci, Anthony (2011) ''The Funny Parts: A History of Film Comedy Routines and Gags'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=pSa-fqnL7iIC&pg=PA231 p.231]</ref> Keaton directed the film, along with [[Edward F. Cline]].

===Sound era and television===
[[File:Buster Keaton and a Spanish journalist.png|thumb|Keaton (right) and [[Gilbert Roland]] in [[San Sebastián, Spain|San Sebastián]], [[Spain]], in August 1930]]
[[File:Parlor, Bedroom and Bath (1).jpg|thumb|With [[Charlotte Greenwood]] in one of his first "talkies", 1931's ''[[Parlor, Bedroom and Bath]]'']]
Keaton signed with MGM in 1928, a business decision that he would later call the worst of his life. He realized too late that the [[studio system]] MGM represented would severely limit his creative input. For instance, the studio refused his request to make his early project, ''[[Spite Marriage]]'', as a sound film and after the studio converted, he was obliged to adhere to dialogue-laden scripts. However, MGM did allow Keaton some creative participation on his last originally developed/written silent film ''[[The Cameraman]]'', 1928, which was his first project under contract with them, but hired [[Edward Sedgwick]] as the official director.

[[File:Speak Easily (1932) 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Buster Keaton, [[Thelma Todd]] & [[Jimmy Durante]] in ''[[Speak Easily]]'']]
Keaton was forced to use a stunt double during some of the more dangerous scenes, something he had never done in his heyday, as MGM wanted badly to protect its investment. "Stuntmen don't get laughs," Keaton had said. Some of his most financially successful films for the studio were during this period. MGM tried teaming the laconic Keaton with the rambunctious [[Jimmy Durante]] in a series of films, ''[[The Passionate Plumber]]'', ''[[Speak Easily]]'', and ''[[What! No Beer?]]'' The latter would be Keaton's last starring feature in his home country. The films proved popular. (Thirty years later, both Keaton and Durante had cameo roles in ''[[It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World]]'', albeit not in the same scenes.)

In the first Keaton pictures with sound, he and his fellow actors would shoot each scene three times: one in English, one in Spanish, and one in either French or German. The actors would phonetically memorize the foreign-language scripts a few lines at a time and shoot immediately after. This is discussed in the TCM documentary ''Buster Keaton: So Funny it Hurt'', with Keaton complaining about having to shoot lousy films not just once, but three times.

Keaton was so demoralized during the production of 1933's ''What! No Beer?'' that MGM fired him after the filming was complete, despite the film being a resounding hit. In 1934, Keaton accepted an offer to make an independent film in Paris, ''[[Le Roi des Champs-Élysées]]''. During this period, he made another film, in England, ''[[The Invader (1935 film)|The Invader]]'' (released in America as ''An Old Spanish Custom'' in 1936).

====Educational Pictures====
Upon Keaton's return to Hollywood, he made a screen comeback in a series of 16 two-reel comedies for [[Educational Pictures]]. Most of these are simple visual comedies, with many of the gags supplied by Keaton himself, often recycling ideas from his family vaudeville act and his earlier films.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gill, David|first=Brownlow, Kevin|title=Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow|year=1987|publisher=Thames Television|pages=Episode three}}</ref> The high point in the Educational series is ''Grand Slam Opera'', featuring Buster in his own screenplay as an amateur-hour contestant. When the series lapsed in 1937, Keaton returned to MGM as a gag writer, including the [[Marx Brothers]] films ''[[At the Circus]]'' (1939) and ''[[Go West (1940 film)|Go West]]'' (1940), and providing material for [[Red Skelton]].<ref name="p34">Knopf, Robert ''The Theater and Cinema of Buster Keaton'' By [http://books.google.com/books?id=fU5qDx7tawIC&pg=PA34 p.34]</ref> He also helped and advised [[Lucille Ball]] in her comedic work in films and television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kathleenbrady.net/lucille_the_life_of_lucille_ball_18269.htm|title=Lucille The Life of Lucille Ball - Kathleen Brady|author=Kathleen Brady|date=May 31, 2014|work=kathleenbrady.net}}</ref>

====Columbia Pictures====
In 1939, [[Columbia Pictures]] hired Keaton to star in ten two-reel comedies, running for two years. The director was usually [[Jules White]], whose emphasis on [[slapstick]] and [[farce]] made most of these films resemble White's [[Three Stooges]] comedies. Keaton's personal favorite was the series' debut entry, ''[[Pest from the West]]'', a shorter, tighter remake of Keaton's little-viewed 1935 feature ''The Invader''; it was directed not by White but by [[Del Lord]], a veteran director for [[Mack Sennett]]. Moviegoers and exhibitors welcomed Keaton's Columbia comedies, proving that the comedian had not lost his appeal. However, taken as a whole, Keaton's Columbia shorts rank as the worst comedies he made, an assessment he concurred with in his autobiography.<ref name="Okuda">{{cite book |last= Okuda |first= Ted |authorlink= Ted Okuda |author2=Watz, Edward |title= ''The Columbia Comedy Shorts'' |publisher= McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers |year= 1986 |page= 139 |isbn= 0-89950-181-8}}</ref> The final entry was ''[[She's Oil Mine]]'', and Keaton swore he would never again "make another crummy two-reeler."<ref name="Okuda"/>

====1940s and feature films====
Keaton's personal life had stabilized with his 1940 marriage, and now he was taking life a little easier, abandoning Columbia for the less strenuous field of feature films. Throughout the 1940s, Keaton played character roles in both "A" and "B" features. He made his last starring feature ''El Moderno Barba Azul'' (1946) in Mexico; the film was a low budget production, and it may not have been seen in the United States until its release on VHS in the 1980s, under the title ''Boom In The Moon''. Critics rediscovered Keaton in 1949 and producers occasionally hired him for bigger "prestige" pictures. He had cameos in such films as ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' (1949), ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950), and ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956). In ''In The Good Old Summertime'', Keaton personally directed the stars [[Judy Garland]] and [[Van Johnson]] in their first scene together where they bump into each other on the street. Keaton invented comedy bits where Johnson keeps trying to apologize to a seething Garland, but winds up messing up her hairdo and tearing her dress.

Keaton also had a cameo as Jimmy, appearing near the end of the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963). Jimmy assists [[Spencer Tracy]]'s character, Captain C. G. Culpepper, by readying Culpepper's ultimately-unused boat for his abortive escape. (The restored version of that film, released in 2013, contains a restored scene where Jimmy and Culpeper talk on the telephone. Lost after the comedy epic's "roadshow" exhibition, the audio of that scene was discovered, and combined with still pictures to recreate the scene.) Keaton was given more screen time in ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1966). The appearance, since it was released after his death, was his posthumous swansong.

Keaton also appeared in a comedy routine about two inept stage musicians in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' (1952), recalling the vaudeville of ''[[The Playhouse (film)|The Playhouse]]''. With the exception of ''Seeing Stars'', a minor publicity film produced in 1922, ''Limelight'' was the only time in which the two would ever appear together on film.

In 1949, comedian [[Ed Wynn]] invited Keaton to appear on his [[CBS Television]] comedy-variety show, ''The Ed Wynn Show'', which was televised live on the West Coast. [[Kinescope]]s were made for distribution of the programs to other parts of the country since there was no transcontinental [[coaxial cable]] until September 1951.

====1950s-1960s and television====
[[File:BusterKeatonKBF1956.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Keaton pretending to have his foot stuck in the railroad tracks of a train ride at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in 1956]]
He had an essentially non-speaking role in ''[[Sunset Blvd. (film)|Sunset Blvd.]]'' (1950), in the bridge playing scene where he utters the word "pass" twice, providing additional weight to the silent era echoes of the movie.

In 1950, Keaton had a successful television series, ''[[The Buster Keaton Show]]'', which was broadcast live on a local Los Angeles station. An attempt to recreate the first series on film as ''Life with Buster Keaton'' (1951), which allowed the program to be broadcast nationwide, was less well received. He also appeared in the early television series ''[[Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town]]''. A theatrical feature film, ''The Misadventures of Buster Keaton'', was fashioned from the series. Keaton said he canceled the filmed series himself because he was unable to create enough fresh material to produce a new show each week. Keaton also appeared on Ed Wynn's variety show. At the age of 55, he successfully recreated one of the stunts of his youth, in which he propped one foot onto a table, then swung the second foot up next to it, and held the awkward position in midair for a moment before crashing to the stage floor. ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' host [[Garry Moore]] recalled, "I asked (Keaton) how he did all those falls, and he said, 'I'll show you'. He opened his jacket and he was all bruised. So that's how he did it—it ''hurt''—but you had to care enough not to care." In 1952 Keaton appeared with [[Charles Chaplin]] in [[Limelight (1952 film)]].

Unlike his contemporary [[Harold Lloyd]], who kept his films from being televised, Keaton's periodic television appearances helped to revive interest in his silent films in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1954, Keaton played his first television dramatic role in "The Awakening", an episode of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[anthology series]] ''[[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents]]''. About this time, he also appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]''.

Also in 1954, Keaton and his wife Eleanor met film programmer [[Raymond Rohauer]], with whom the couple would develop a business partnership to re-release Keaton's films. Around the same time, after buying the comedian's house, the actor [[James Mason]] found numerous cans of Keaton's films. Among the re-discovered films was Keaton's long-lost classic ''[[The Boat (film)|The Boat]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2009/24/5-for-the-day-james-mason |title=The House Next Door: 5 for the Day: James Mason |publisher=www.slantmagazine.com |date=August 24, 2009 |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref> The [[Coronet Theatre]] art house in Los Angeles, with which Rohauer was involved, was showing ''The General'' which "Buster hadn't seen ... in years and he wanted me to see it," Eleanor Keaton said in 1987.

I go down and there he is with Eleanor. The next day I met with him at his home. I didn't realize we were going to join forces. But I realized he had this I-don't-care attitude about his stuff. He said, 'It's valueless. I don't own the rights.'"<ref name=videomagazine1987 /> Keaton had prints of the features '' Three Ages'', ''Sherlock, Jr.'', ''Steamboat Bill, Jr.'', ''College'' (missing one reel) and the shorts "The Boat" and "My Wife's Relations", which Keaton and Rohauer had transferred to [[Cellulose acetate film|safety stock]] from deteriorating [[Nitrate film|nitrate film stock]]. Unknown to them at the time, [[MGM]] also had saved some of Keaton's work: all his 1920-1926 features and his first eight two-reel shorts.<ref name=videomagazine1987 />

[[File:Buster Keaton Twilight Zone 1961.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Keaton as a time traveler in ''The Twilight Zone'' episode, "[[Once Upon a Time (The Twilight Zone)|Once Upon a Time]]", November 1961.]]

On April 3, 1957, Keaton was surprised by [[Ralph Edwards]] for the weekly [[NBC]] program ''[[This Is Your Life]]''. The half hour program, which also promoted the release of the biographical film ''The Buster Keaton Story'' with [[Donald O'Connor]], summarized Keaton's life and career up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/calendar/calendardetails.aspx?details_type=2&id=373 |title=Series Details |publisher=Cinema.ucla.edu |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}</ref>

In December 1958, Keaton was a guest star as Charlie, a hospital janitor who provides gifts to sick children, in a special Christmas episode of ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The program was titled "A Very Merry Christmas". He returned to the program in 1965 in the episode "Now You See It, Now You Don't". The 1958 episode has been included in the DVD release of [[Donna Reed]]'s television programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0564206/ |title="The Donna Reed Show" A Very Merry Christmas (1958) |publisher=Us.imdb.com |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}</ref> Actor Paul Peterson, a regular on "The Donna Reed Show," recalls in the book "The Fall of Buster Keaton" (2010, Scarecrow Press) that Keaton "put together an incredible physical skit. His skills were amazing. I never saw anything like it before or since."

In August 1960, Keaton accepted the role of mute King Sextimus the Silent in the national touring company of ''[[Once Upon A Mattress]]'', a successful Broadway musical. Eleanor Keaton was cast in the chorus, and during rehearsals, she fielded questions directed at her husband, creating difficulties in communication. After a few days, Keaton warmed up to the rest of the cast with his "utterly delicious sense of humor", according to [[Fritzi Burr]], who played opposite him as his wife Queen Aggravaine. When the tour landed in Los Angeles, Keaton invited the entire cast and crew to a spaghetti party at his [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills]] home, and entertained them by singing vaudeville songs.<ref>{{cite book |title=Buster Keaton: Cut to the Chase|last=Meade |first=Marion|year=1997|publisher=Da Capo |isbn=0-306-80802-1|page=284}}</ref>

In 1960, Keaton returned to MGM for the final time, playing a lion tamer in a [[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1960 film)|1960 adaptation]] of [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''. Much of the film was shot on location on the [[Sacramento River]], which doubled for the [[Mississippi River]] setting of Twain's original book.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1960) |first=Bosley | last=Crowther |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 4, 1960 |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E04E6D7163CEF3ABC4C53DFBE66838B679EDE |authorlink=Bosley Crowther}}</ref>

In 1961, he starred in ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Once Upon a Time (The Twilight Zone)|Once Upon a Time]]", which included both silent and sound sequences. Keaton played time-traveler Mulligan, who traveled from 1890 to 1960, then back, by means of a special helmet.

In January 1962, he worked with comedian Ernie Kovacs on a television pilot tentatively titled "Medicine Man," shooting scenes for it on January 12, 1962—the day before Kovacs died in a car crash. "Medicine Man" was completed but not aired.<ref name="Last">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=szoaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4CYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4585,4182020&dq=ernie+kovacs&hl=en|date=February 8, 1962|last=Spiro | first = J.

Keaton also found steady work as an actor in TV commercials, including a series of silent ads for Simon Pure Beer made in 1962 by [[Jim Mohr]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] in which he revisited some of the gags from his silent film days.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In 1964, Keaton appeared with [[Joan Blondell]] and [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]] in the final episode of ABC's circus drama, ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', starring [[Jack Palance]]. In November, 1965, he appeared on the CBS television special ''A Salute To Stan Laurel'' which was a tribute to the late comedian (and friend of Keaton's) who had died earlier that year. The program was produced as a benefit for the Motion Picture Relief Fund and featured a plethora of celebrities, including [[Dick Van Dyke]], [[Danny Kaye]], [[Phil Silvers]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Cesar Romero]], and  Lucille Ball. In one segment, Ball and Keaton do a silent sketch on a park bench with the two clowns wrestling over an oversized newspaper, until a policeman (played by [[Harvey Korman]]) breaks up the fun. The skit called "A Day in the Park" was filmed and broadcast in color. It marked the only time Ball and Keaton worked together in front of a camera.<ref>This is mentioned on p. 202 in The Lucy Book by Geoffrey Mark Fidelman (Renaissance Books).</ref>

Keaton starred in four films for American International Pictures: 1964's ''[[Pajama Party (film)|Pajama Party]]'' and 1965's ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'', ''[[How to Stuff a Wild Bikini]]'' and ''[[Sergeant Deadhead]]''. As he had done in the past, Keaton also provided gags for the four AIP films in which he appeared. Those films' director, [[William Asher]], who cast Keaton, recalled,
{{quote|I always loved Buster Keaton. I thought, what a wonderful person to look on and react to these young kids and to view them as the audience might, to shake his head at their crazy antics. ... He loved it. He would bring me bits and routines. He'd say,'How about this?' and it would just be this wonderful, inventive stuff. A lot of the audience seemed to be seeing Buster for the first time. Once the kids in the cast became aware of who he was, they all respected him and were crazy about him. And the other comics who came in—[[Paul Lynde]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Buddy Hackett]]—they hit it off with him great.<ref>{{cite news | title = Beach Blanket Buster | url = http://www.scribd.com/doc/149371262/Interview-Beach-movie-director-William-Asher-on-Buster-Keaton | authorlink = Frank Lovece | first=Frank | last= Lovece | work = Video | date = February 1987 | accessdate = August 31, 2013 | archivedate = August 31, 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6JHr6IMiw | deadurl=no}}</ref>}}

In 1965, Keaton starred in the short film ''[[The Railrodder]]''<!--this is ''not'' a spelling error!--> for the [[National Film Board of Canada]]. Wearing his traditional pork pie hat, he travelled from one end of Canada to the other on a motorized handcar, performing gags similar to those in films he made 50 years before. The film is also notable for being Keaton's last silent screen performance. ''The Railrodder'' was made in tandem with a behind-the-scenes documentary about Keaton's life and times, called ''[[Buster Keaton Rides Again]]'', also made for the National Film Board, which is twice the length of the short film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/buster_keaton_rides_again_return_of_the_great_stone_face|title=Buster Keaton Rides Again: Return of ‘The Great Stone Face’|work=DangerousMinds}}</ref>  He played the central role in [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Film (film)|Film]]'' (1965), directed by [[Alan Schneider]]. Also in 1965, he traveled to Italy to play a role in ''[[Due Marines e un Generale]]'', co-starring alongside with the famous Italian comedian duo of [[Franco Franchi]] and [[Ciccio Ingrassia]]. In 1987 Italian singer-songwriters [[Claudio Lolli]] and [[Francesco Guccini]] wrote a song, "Keaton", about his work on that film.

Keaton's last commercial film appearance was in ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1966) which was filmed in Spain in September-November 1965. He amazed the cast and crew by doing many of his own stunts, although [[Thames Television]] said his increasingly ill health did force the use of a stunt double for some scenes. His final appearance on film was a 1965 safety film produced in Toronto, Canada by the Construction Safety Associations of Ontario in collaboration with Perini, Ltd.(now Tutor Perini Corporation), "The Scribe."  Keaton, plays a lowly janitor at a newspaper. He intercepts a request from the editor to visit a construction site adjacent to the newspaper headquarters to investigate possible safety violations. Chaos ensues! Keaton died shortly after completing the film. .<ref>Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow, Chap. 3, Thames Television, 1987</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:Buster Keaton with Family 1922.jpg|thumb|left|Keaton with family in 1922]]
In 1921, Keaton married [[Natalie Talmadge]], sister-in-law of his boss, [[Joseph Schenck]], and sister of actresses [[Norma Talmadge]] and [[Constance Talmadge]]. She co-starred with Keaton in ''[[Our Hospitality]]''. The couple had two sons, James (June 2, 1922– February 14, 2007) and Robert (February 3, 1924– July 19, 2009), but after the birth of Robert, the relationship began to suffer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=161352 |title=Buster Keaton Profile |publisher=Tcm.com |accessdate=February 17, 2010}}</ref>

Influenced by her family, Talmadge decided not to have any more children and this led to the couple staying in separate bedrooms. Her financial extravagance (she would spend up to a third of his salary on clothes) was another factor in the breakdown of the marriage.  Keaton dated actresses Dorothy Sebastian beginning in the 1920s and [[Kathleen Key]].<ref>McPherson, Edward, Buster Keaton: Tempest in a Flat Hat, 2005</ref> in the early 1930s. After attempts at reconciliation, Talmadge divorced Keaton in 1932, taking his entire fortune and refusing to allow any contact between Keaton and his sons, whose last name she had changed to Talmadge. Keaton was reunited with them about a decade later when his older son turned 18. With the failure of his marriage, and the loss of his independence as a filmmaker, Keaton lapsed into a period of alcoholism.<ref name="b-k"/>

In 1926, Keaton spent $300,000 to build a {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} home in Beverly Hills designed by architect [[Gene Verge, Sr.]], which was later owned by [[James Mason]] and [[Cary Grant]].<ref name="historic">[http://www.beverlyhills.org/cbhfiles/storage/files/6333100111590038901/HistoricResourcesInventory%281985-1986%29.pdf The City of Beverly Hills: Historic Resources Inventory (1985-1986)]</ref> Keaton's "Italian Villa" can be seen in Keaton's film ''[[Parlor, Bedroom and Bath]]''. Keaton later said, "I took a lot of [[pratfall]]s to build that dump."

The house suffered approximately $10,000 worth of damage from a fire in the nursery and dining room in 1931. Keaton was not at home at the time, and his wife and children escaped unharmed, staying at the home of [[Tom Mix]] until the following morning.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mrs. Keaton, Children Rescued from Blaze |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gCkbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=C0sEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4219%2C13081 |newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press |date=January 11, 1930 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}</ref>

Keaton was at one point briefly institutionalized; however, according to the [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] documentary ''So Funny it Hurt'', Keaton escaped a [[straitjacket]] with tricks learned during his vaudeville days. In 1933, he married his nurse, Mae Scriven, during an alcoholic binge about which he afterwards claimed to remember nothing (Keaton himself later called that period an "alcoholic blackout"). Scriven herself would later claim that she didn't know Keaton's real first name until after the marriage. The singular event that triggered Scriven filing for divorce in 1935 was her finding Keaton with Leah Clampitt Sewell (libertine wife of millionaire [[Braden Copper Company|Barton Sewell]]) on July 4 the same year in a hotel in Santa Barbara.<ref>{{cite news |title=Buster Keaton's Second Wife Sues Him for Divorce |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19350718&id=RwoxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=teEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2071,3248409 |newspaper=Reading Eagle |date=July 18, 1935 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref> When they divorced in 1936, it was again at great financial cost to Keaton.<ref>Dardis, Tom, Buster Keaton: The Man Who Wouldn't Lie Down, 1996</ref>

In 1940, Keaton married Eleanor Norris (July 29, 1918– October 19, 1998), who was 23 years his junior. She has been credited by [[Jeffrey Vance]] with saving his life by stopping his heavy drinking, and helped to salvage his career.<ref>Vance, Jeffrey. "Introduction." Keaton, Eleanor and Jeffrey Vance.  Buster Keaton Remembered. Harry N. Abrams, 2001, pg. 29. ISBN 0-8109-4227-5</ref> The marriage lasted until his death. Between 1947 and 1954, they appeared regularly in the [[Cirque Medrano]] in Paris as a double act. She came to know his routines so well that she often participated in them on TV revivals.

The [[International Buster Keaton Society]] was founded on October 4, 1992 – Buster’s birthday. Dedicated to bringing greater public attention to Keaton’s life and work, the membership includes many individuals from the television and film industry: actors, producers, authors, artists, graphic novelists, musicians, and designers, as well as those who simply admire the magic of Buster Keaton. The Society’s nickname, the “Damfinos,” draws its name from a boat in Buster’s 1921 comedy, “The Boat.”

[[File:KeatonPorkpie.jpg|thumb|Keaton seated, in costume, wearing his signature pork pie hat, circa 1939.]]

In 1994, caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]] penned a series of silent film stars for the [[United States Post Office]], including [[Rudolph Valentino]] and Keaton.<ref>[[Associated Press]], Polly Anderson, January 20, 2003. "Famed Caricaturist Al Hirschfeld Dies".</ref> Hirschfeld said that modern film stars were more difficult to depict, that silent film comedians such as [[Laurel and Hardy]] and Keaton "looked like their caricatures".<ref>Leopold, David. [http://books.google.com/books?id=L-D7ZvwQUIAC ''Hirschfeld's Hollywood''], Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, p. 20.</ref>

Keaton's physical comedy is cited by [[Jackie Chan]] in his autobiography documentary ''Jackie Chan: My Story'' as being the primary source of inspiration for his own brand of self-deprecating physical comedy.

Comedian [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] stated that Keaton was his prime inspiration, and spoke of having a close friendship with Keaton's widow Eleanor. Lewis was particularly moved by the fact that Eleanor said Lewis's eyes looked like Keaton's.<ref>TCM voice-over, October 2011, "Buster Keaton Month".</ref>

In 2012, ''The Ultimate Buster Keaton Collection'', a 14-disc [[Blu-ray]] box set of Keaton's best work, including eleven of his feature films and much more, was produced by Kino Lorber.<ref name=DGA>{{cite journal|last=Rafferty|first=Terrence|title=DVD Classics: Laugh Out Loud|journal=DGA Quarterly|date=January 2013|volume=Winter|url=http://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/Categories/DVD-Classics.aspx?IID={F5122F4A-5C20-48DA-9A46-D9C8C04A26A1}|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref>

===Pork pie hats===
Keaton designed and modified his own [[pork pie hat]]s during his career. In 1964, he told an interviewer that in making "this particular pork pie", he "started with a good [[Stetson]] and cut it down", stiffening the brim with sugar water.<ref name=howto/> The hats were often destroyed during Keaton's wild film antics; some were given away as gifts and some were snatched by souvenir hunters. Keaton said he was lucky if he used only six hats in making a film. Keaton estimated that he and his wife Eleanor made thousands of the hats during his career. Keaton observed that during his silent period, such a hat cost him around two dollars; at the time of his interview, he said, they cost almost $13.<ref name=howto>{{cite web|url=http://www.busterkeaton.com/howto.htm |title=''How To Make A Porkpie Hat''.
