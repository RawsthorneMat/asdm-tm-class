'''Jan Tomáš Forman''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈjan ˈtomaːʃ ˈforman|lang}}; born February 18, 1932), known as '''Miloš Forman''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈmɪloʃ ˈforman|}}, {{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|m|iː|l|oʊ|ʃ|_|ˈ|f|ɔər|m|ən}}), is a [[Czechs|Czech]] film director, screenwriter, actor, and professor, who until 1968 lived and worked primarily in the former [[Czechoslovakia]].

Forman was one of the most important directors of the [[Czechoslovak New Wave]]. His 1967 film ''[[The Fireman's Ball]]'', on the surface a naturalistic representation of an ill-fated social event in a provincial town, was seen by both movie scholars and authorities in Czechoslovakia as a biting satire on Eastern European Communism, resulting in it being banned for many years in Forman's home country.

Since Forman left Czechoslovakia, two of his films, ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' and ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', have acquired particular renown, both gaining him an [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' was the second to win all five major Academy Awards (Best Picture, Actor in Leading Role, Actress in Leading Role, Director, and Screenplay) following ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' in 1934, an accomplishment not repeated until 1991 by ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''. Forman was also nominated for a Best Director Oscar for ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]''. He has also won [[Golden Globe]], [[Cannes]], [[Berlinale]], [[BAFTA]], [[César Award|Cesar]], [[David di Donatello]], [[European Film Academy]], and [[Czech Lion]] awards.<ref name=academy>[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1293969838681 List of Milos Forman nominations].

After the war, Forman attended the elite King George boarding school in the spa town [[Podebrady|Poděbrady]], where his fellow students included [[Václav Havel]], the [[Masin|Mašín brothers]] and future film-makers [[Ivan Passer]] and [[Jerzy Skolimowski]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/mar/11/1?INTCMP=SRCH I Had a Wild Life].

He was assistant of [[Alfréd Radok|Alfred Radok]], creator of [[Laterna Magika]]. During the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in summer 1968, he left Europe for the United States.

Forman's first wife was Czech movie star [[Jana Brejchová]]. They met during the making of the movie ''Štěňata'' (1957). They divorced in 1962. Forman has twin sons with his second wife, Czech actress Věra Křesadlová-Formanová. Both sons, Petr Forman and Matěj Forman, born 1964, are involved in the theatre. That marriage lasted for thirty-five years, spanning 1964 to 1999. Then Forman married Martina Zbořilová on November 28, 1999. They also have twin sons, Jim and Andy (born 1999, named for comics [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Andy Kaufman]]), and reside in Connecticut, USA.

In 2006, he received the [[Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award]] presented by the Prague Society for International Cooperation.

He is a professor emeritus at [[Columbia University]].<ref name=coluniv>[https://directory.columbia.edu/people/uni;jsessionid=5E073DC2A9EB9EA2EBF2F98E9AC40E90?code=mf20 Milos Forman page at Columbia University]. Directory.columbia.edu. Retrieved on June 23, 2011.</ref>

The asteroid [[11333 Forman]] was named after Forman.

In 2009 a documentary film about Forman directed by Miloš Šmídmajer was produced – ''Miloš Forman: Co te nezabije...''.

Forman has written poems and published an autobiography called ''My Two Worlds''.

==Career==
Along with future favorite [[cinematographer]] [[Miroslav Ondříček]] and longtime schoolfriend [[Ivan Passer]], Forman filmed the silent documentary ''Semafor'' about [[Semafor]] theater. Forman's first important production was the documentary ''Audition'' whose subject was competing singers. He directed several [[Czech language|Czech]] comedies in [[Czechoslovakia]]. However, during the [[Prague Spring]] and the ensuing 1968 invasion, he was in Paris negotiating the production of his first American film. His employer, a Czech studio, fired him, claiming that he had been out of the country illegally. He moved to New York, where he later became a professor of film at [[Columbia University]] and co-chair (with his former teacher [[František Daniel]]) of Columbia's film department. One of his [[protégé]]s was future director [[James Mangold]], whom Forman had advised about [[scriptwriting]].

In 1977, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

In 1985 he headed the [[Cannes]] film festival and in 2000 did the same for the [[Venice]] festival. He presided over a ceremony of [[César Award|Caesar]] in 1988.

In 1997, he received the [[Crystal Globe]] award for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]]. Forman performed alongside actor [[Edward Norton]] in Norton's directorial debut, ''[[Keeping the Faith]]'' (2000), as the wise friend to Norton's conflicted priest.

In April 2007 the [[jazz]] opera ''[[Dobře placená procházka]]'' premiered at the [[National Theatre (Prague)|Prague National Theatre]], directed by Forman's son, Petr Forman.

Forman received an honorary degree in 2009 from [[Emerson College]] in Boston, USA.<ref>[http://www.emerson.edu/news-events/emerson-college-today/archives/2009?postingID=11144 Emerson.edu]</ref>

He regularly collaborates with [[cinematographer]] [[Miroslav Ondříček]].

====''Hair''====
[[File:Woodstock redmond hair.JPG|right|250px|thumb|''Hair'' (1979).]]
The success of ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' allowed Forman to direct the long-planned film ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]'' (a [[rock musical]]) in 1979, based on the [[Broadway musical]] by [[James Rado]], [[Gerome Ragni]], and [[Galt MacDermot]]. The film starred [[Treat Williams]], [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]].

====''Amadeus''====

===Influence on the Czech language===
Forman's early films are popular among Czechs. Many situations and phrases from his movies have passed into common use. For example, the Czech term ''zhasnout'' (''to switch lights off'') from ''[[The Fireman's Ball]]'', associated with petty theft in the film, has been used to describe the large-scale [[asset stripping]] that occurred in the country during the 1990s.
