He also participated in a documentary produced by [[Television Broadcasts Limited]]''[[On the Road (Hong Kong TV series)|On the Road II]] '' ({{lang|zh|向世界出發II}}), made in [[Cambodia]] in 2007.

==Personal life==
Tse once had a relationship with musician [[Faye Wong]], who is 11 years his senior but they broke up in 2002.<ref>[http://www.millennial-fair.com/entertain/music/faye.html "Millennial Fair: Faye Wong''] Retrieved on 22 April 2008</ref> On 31 July 2006, Tse officially admitted dating [[Cecilia Cheung]] in an interview with Hong Kong commercial radio station 881/903.

However, their deemed romantic relationship ended on 14 June 2011 when Tse reportedly filed for divorce with Cheung.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tay |first=Vanessa Valerie |title=Nicholas Tse divorces Cecilia Cheung |url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20110614-284059.html |accessdate=15 June 2011 |newspaper=AsiaOne |date=14 June 2011}}</ref> On 21 September 2014 it was reported that Tse is back in a relationship with Faye Wong, who had divorced her latest spouse in 2013.<ref>[http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/music/story/faye-wong-and-nicholas-tse-history-plus-how-vicki-zhao-helped-reunite-them-201] Retrieved on 21 September 2014</ref>

==Incidents==

===2002 motoring incident===
In the early morning of 23 March 2002, Tse crashed his [[Ferrari 360|Ferrari 360 Modena]] in [[Central, Hong Kong|Hong Kong Central]].<ref>Sina.China. "[http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/2002-04-13/79528.html Sina.China]." ''Nicholas Tse incident.'' Retrieved on 23 April 2008.</ref> Initially it was claimed that his driver was responsible for the crash, but further investigation by the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|ICAC]] revealed the story was fabricated, involving three other men and a police officer. Tse spent two weeks in prison<ref>Kate Drake, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501030317-430922,00.html 10 questions for Nicholas Tse], Time Asia</ref> and was sentenced to 240 hours of [[community service]] for obstruction of justice.<ref name="Kungfu1" /> Officer Lau Chi-Wai was sentenced to six months in prison. Although some viewed this charge as lenient, the 240 hours was the maximum punishment for this offence, given that Tse was a young offender at the time (21 years and 7 months). Nonetheless, some claimed that the sentence would send out a wrong message to Hong Kong youths, but it could be argued handing out a harsher sentence because he was a celebrity is just as inappropriate as handing out a lighter one. This incident had caused him to have a downfall in popularity.<ref name="Kungfu1" />  Tse has said that money he was getting increased by 40% since the accident.<ref name="Time1">Time.com. "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501030317-430922,00.html Time.com]." ''10 questions for Nicholas Tse.'' Retrieved on 4 July 2008.</ref> The car was originally a gift from the company EEG, as Tse himself accounted for 56% of its revenue.<ref name="Time1" />

After the police charge, Tse spent several months to "discover himself", and released the album ''Reborn'' in about half an year, following with a tour around the East and Southeast Asia. He has stated that he would be taking a break from singing and be focusing on his acting for a year.

===2002 assault allegations===
Tse has had his share of brush-ups with 'paparazzi'. A photographer of ''[[Sudden Weekly]]'' magazine accused Tse of hitting him outside a restaurant in Taiwan, bruising his nose and elbow. Although Tse denied the assault charge, he settled in July 2002.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2163351.stm "HK star settles assault charge"], [[BBC News]], 31 July 2002</ref>

==Discography==
{{main|Nicholas Tse discography}}
Most of Nicholas Tse's songs were based on the [[cantopop]] [[Chinese rock|rock]] genre such as some of his top hits "''front, back, left, right''" (前前後後左左右右), "''Exposure''" (曝光) and "''Lonely Base''" (寂寞堂口). Some of his songs were produced in Tse's own 'Nic Production' which was revealed in TVB interviews several times. "''Live Viva''" (活著 Viva),  one of Tse's most classical pop rock song, in whose MV Tse was featured with his flame guitar and a flamethrower, is widely known in Hong Kong.
<!-- removed laundry list of songs - some of these can be written out in prose form, like for the duets, but let's not try to be exhaustive -->

Tse has sung a number of [[duet]]s with fellow cantopop singers, namely "''Love''" (愛) with [[Charlene Choi]], "''Second Life''" (第二世), "''Amen''" (阿門) both with [[Joey Yung]], "''Kid''" (細路) with [[Eason Chan]],  "''You Can't Stop Me''" with [[Sam Lee (actor)|Sam Lee]] and [[Stephen Fung]] as well as "''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/meilingray#p/u/28/AeMEwQejQP8 |title=Meilin 梅琳 and Nicholas Tse 謝霆鋒 – Beauty and The Beast MV |work=youtube |accessdate=2011-06-04}}</ref> with [[Meilin Gray|Meilin]].

Besides being a singer, Tse also showed his interest and talent in song-writing. Plenty of his songs were produced by himself, either of the lyrics or the melody or both. Take his most renowned Mandarin songs "''I love you because I love you''"(因為愛所以愛） and "''Huang Zhong Ren''"(黃種人） for example, Tse composed and arranged both of these songs' melodies and also participated in the creation of lyrics in "''Huang Zhong Ren''".
