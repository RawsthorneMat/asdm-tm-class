Hawke's next film, 1991's ''[[White Fang (1991 film)|White Fang]]'', brought his first leading role. The film, an adaptation of [[Jack London]]'s [[White Fang|novel of the same name]], featured Hawke as Jack Conroy, a [[Yukon]] gold hunter who befriends a [[wolfdog]].

Hawke's next role was in the Generation X drama [[Reality Bites]] (1994), in which he played Troy, a slacker who mocks the ambitions of his love interest (played by [[Winona Ryder]]). Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] called Hawke's performance convincing and noteworthy: "Hawke captures all the right notes as the boorish Troy."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/reality-bites-1994|title=Reality Bites|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=February 18, 1994|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' noted, "Mr. Hawke's subtle and strong performance makes it clear that Troy feels things too deeply to risk failure and admit he's feeling anything at all."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/18/movies/review-film-coming-of-age-in-snippets-life-as-a-twentysomething.html?pagewanted=all|title=Coming of Age in Snippets: Life as a Twentysomething|last=James|first=Caryn|date=February 18, 1994|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 19, 2012}}</ref> Nonetheless, the film was a box-office disappointment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1994-04-03/entertainment/25862687_1_reality-bites-generation-x-movies-david-ansen|last=Rickey|first=Carrie|title=Generation X Turns Its Back|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|page=L01|date=April 3, 1994|accessdate=May 23, 2011}}</ref>

The following year Hawke again received critical acclaim, this time for his performance in [[Richard Linklater]]'s 1995 drama [[Before Sunrise]].

Hawke said of the novel, "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did. And it was just one of the best things I ever did."<ref name="sunrise"/> The book met with a mixed reception.

Hawke's next film role was in [[Michael Almereyda]]'s 2000 film ''Hamlet'', in which he played the [[Prince Hamlet|title character]].

<blockquote>
... when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum. And he loved horror movies and he went on to create his own little subgenre with "Paranormal Activity." And he kept trying to talk to me about how I should love this whole genre.

In an October 2012 interview, Hawke said that he prefers great art over politics, explaining that his preference shows "how little" he cares about the latter:

<blockquote>
... I think about the first people of our generation to do great art. I see [[Michael Chabon]] write a great book; when I see [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] do ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' last year -- I see people of my generation being fully realized in their work, and I find that really kind of exciting. But politics? I don't know. [[Paul Ryan]] is certainly not my man.<ref name="Mike" /></blockquote>
