'''Victor Lonzo Fleming''' (February 23, 1889 – January 6, 1949) was an American film director, [[cinematographer]], and producer. His most popular films were ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939), and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), for which he won an [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. Fleming holds the achievement of being the only film director to have two films listed in the top 10 of the [[American Film Institute]]'s prestigious 2007 [[100 Years...100 Movies|AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] list.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Victor Fleming was born in [[La Canada, California]], the son of Elizabeth Evaleen (née Hartman) and William Alonzo "Lon" Fleming, who worked in the water industry in Pasadena.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=KZDydTs8_nkC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=Victor+Fleming+eva+1889&source=bl&ots=FKiMXRFDn2&sig=Fl9bWi3MHHAcEpu1B6sisrtpL_4&hl=en#v=onepage&q=lon&f=false]</ref> His mother was of part German descent.

===Career===
He served in the photographic section during [[World War I]], and acted as chief photographer for President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]], France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Victor-Fleming-9297044|publisher=biography.com|title=Victor Fleming Biography|accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref> He showed a mechanical aptitude early in life; while working as a car mechanic he met the director [[Allan Dwan]], who took him on as a camera assistant. He soon rose to the rank of cinematographer, working with both Dwan and [[D. W. Griffith]], and directed his first film in 1919.<ref>Glen O. Gabbard, Krin Gabbard, ''Psychiatry and the Cinema'', page 37 (American Psychiatric Press, Inc., 1999, second edition). ISBN 0-88048-826-3</ref>

Many of his [[silent films]] were action movies, often starring [[Douglas Fairbanks]], or Westerns. Because of his robust attitude and love of outdoor sports, he become known as a "man's director"; however, he also proved an effective director of women. Under his direction, [[Vivien Leigh]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Oscar]], [[Hattie McDaniel]] won for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], and [[Olivia De Havilland]] was nominated.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
In 1932, Fleming joined [[MGM]] and directed some of the studio's most prestigious films. ''[[Red Dust]]'' (1932), ''[[Bombshell (film)|Bombshell]]'' (1933), and ''[[Reckless (1935 film)|Reckless]]'' (1935) showcased [[Jean Harlow]], while ''[[Treasure Island (1934 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1934) and ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'' (1937) brought a touch of literary distinction to [[Boy's Own Paper|boy's-own]] adventure stories. His two most famous films came in 1939, when ''The Wizard of Oz'' was closely followed by ''Gone with the Wind''.

Fleming's version of ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1941), with [[Spencer Tracy]], was generally rated below [[Rouben Mamoulian]]'s 1931 [[Pre-Code]] version, which had starred [[Fredric March]]. Fleming's 1942 film version of [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Tortilla Flat (film)|Tortilla Flat]]'' starred Tracy, [[John Garfield]], [[Hedy Lamarr]], and [[Frank Morgan]]. Other films that Fleming made with Tracy include ''Captains Courageous'' (for which Tracy won his first Oscar), ''A Guy Named Joe'', and ''Test Pilot''. He directed [[Clark Gable]] in a total of five films – ''Red Dust'', ''The White Sister'', ''Test Pilot'', ''Gone with the Wind'', and ''Adventure''.

===Personal life===
He owned the [[Moraga Estate]] in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]], California, then a horse ranch.<ref name="officialhistory">[http://www.moragavineyards.com/history.php Official website: History]</ref><ref name="megjames">Meg James, [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-rupert-murdoch-buys-bel-airs-moraga-vineyard-20130510,0,114629.story Rupert Murdoch buys Moraga Vineyards estate in Bel Air], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', May 10, 2013</ref><ref name="irene">S.

He died suddenly, while en route to a hospital in [[Cottonwood, Arizona]]<ref name="google2">{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=MNNNGtAgD4EC&dat=19490107&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Prescott Evening Courier - Google News Archive Search|publisher=news.google.com|accessdate=November 30, 2014}}</ref> after suffering a [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) on January 6, 1949. His death occurred shortly after completing ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'' (1948) with Ingrid Bergman, one of the few films that he did not make for MGM. Despite mixed reviews, Fleming's film version of the life of [[Joan of Arc|Joan]] received seven [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning two.

===Comment by Anne Revere===
It was reported in [[James Curtis (biographer)|James Curtis]]' book ''Spencer Tracy: A Biography''<ref>Curtis, James ''Spencer Tracy: A Biography'' p. 417</ref> that [[Anne Revere]] once said Fleming was "violently pro-Nazi" and strongly opposed to the United States entering [[World War II]]. According to the Fleming biography ''Victor Fleming: An American Movie Master'',<ref>Michael Sragow, ''Victor Fleming: An American Movie Master'', (Pantheon, 2008). ISBN 978-0375407482</ref> by author [[Michael Sragow]], Fleming had once mocked the UK at the outset of [[World War II]] by taking a bet as to how long the country could withstand an attack by Germany. Furthermore, Revere had made her comment because she felt she had been cast in the film ''[[The Yearling (film)|The Yearling]]'' over [[Flora Robson]] because Robson was British. However, at the time of the casting, Fleming was working on the film ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', which featured a British producer and a cast largely-composed of British or British Commonwealth actors. Furthermore, Revere did not know Fleming beyond their professional relationship. According to the cited biography, there is no other supporting evidence for Revere's claim.
