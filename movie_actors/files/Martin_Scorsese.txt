Part of the [[New Hollywood]] wave of filmmaking, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and influential filmmakers in cinema history. In 1990, he founded [[The Film Foundation]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to [[film preservation]], and in 2007 he founded the [[World Cinema Foundation]]. He is a recipient of the [[AFI Life Achievement Award]] for his contributions to the cinema, and has won an [[Academy Award]], a [[Palme d'Or]], [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Cannes Film Festival Best Director Award]], [[Silver Lion]], [[Grammy Award]], [[Emmy Award|Emmys]], [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]], [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTAs]], and [[Directors Guild of America Award|DGA Awards]].

Scorsese's body of work addresses such themes as Italian-American identity, [[Roman Catholic]] concepts of guilt and [[Salvation|redemption]],<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/people/ps/Martin_Scorsese.html The Religious Affiliation of Director Martin Scorsese] Webpage created May 27, 2005.

Many of his films are also notable for their depiction of violence and liberal use of [[profanity]]. He has directed landmark films such as the crime film ''[[Mean Streets]]'' (1973), the comedy-drama ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), the vigilante-drama ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), the biographical sports drama ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), the black comedy ''[[The King of Comedy (1983 film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983), and the crime film ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), all of which he [[Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro|collaborated on]] with actor and close friend [[Robert De Niro]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800014966|title=Yahoo!

With eight Best Director nominations to date, he is the most nominated living director, and is tied with [[Billy Wilder]] for the second most nominations overall. Since the epic historical drama ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' in 2002, Scorsese has also been noted for his collaborations with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], having had directed him in five films.

==Early life==
[[File:Cuccia-Scorsese-Deseta.jpg|thumb|From left: [[Salvo Cuccia]], Martin Scorsese and [[Vittorio De Seta]] at the [[Tribeca Film Festival|2005 Tribeca Film Festival]]]]
Scorsese was born in [[Queens]], [[New York]]. His family moved to the [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]] section of [[Manhattan]] before he started school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture/martin-scorsese-biography |title=Martin Scorsese Biography |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}</ref> His father, Charles Scorsese (1913–93), and mother, [[Catherine Scorsese]] (born Cappa; 1912–97), both worked in New York's [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]]. His father was a clothes presser and an actor, and his mother was a seamstress and an actress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/26/Martin-Scorsese.html|title=Martin Scorsese Biography (1942–2011)|publisher=Filmreference.com|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> His father's parents emigrated from [[Polizzi Generosa]], in the province of [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], and his maternal grandparents were also from Palermo, precisely from [[Ciminna]]. Scorsese was raised in a devoutly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] environment.<ref name="NYTbio"/> As a boy he had [[asthma]] and could not play sports or do any activities with other children and so his parents and his older brother would often take him to movie theaters; it was at this stage in his life that he developed a passion for cinema.

Scorsese has cited [[Sabu Dastagir|Sabu]] and [[Victor Mature]] as his favorite actors during his youth and has spoken of the influence of the 1947 Powell-Pressburger film ''[[Black Narcissus]]'', whose innovative techniques later impacted his filmmaking.<ref name="DVD">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Black-Narcissus-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00004XQN4|title=Black Narcissus (The Criterion Collection) (2001) DVD commentary|publisher=Criterion|accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref> Enamored of historical epics in his adolescence, at least two films of the genre, ''[[Land of the Pharaohs]]'' and ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'', appear to have had a deep and lasting impact on his cinematic psyche. Scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on [[Italian neorealism]], and commented on how ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' alongside ''[[Paisà]]'', ''[[Rome, Open City]]'' inspired him and how this influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian roots. In his documentary, ''[[Il Mio Viaggio in Italia]]'', Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''Paisà'', which he first saw on television alongside his relatives, who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, made a significant impact on his life.<ref name="hatchet"/> He acknowledges owing a great debt to the French New Wave and has stated that "the French New Wave has influenced all filmmakers who have worked since, whether they saw the films or not."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newwavefilm.com/new-wave-cinema-guide/nouvelle-vague-where-to-start.shtml|title=New Wave Film Guide: Nouvelle Vague & International New Wave Cinema - Where to Start|publisher=Newwavefilm.com|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref> He has also cited filmmakers including [[Satyajit Ray]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], and [[Federico Fellini]] as a major influence on his career.<ref name="hatchet">{{cite web|author=Chris Ingui|publisher=Hatchet|url=http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2002/03/04/Arts/Martin.Scorsese.Hits.Dc.Hangs.With.The.Hachet-195598.shtml|title=Martin Scorsese hits DC, hangs with the Hachet|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Raging Bull: A film review|author=Jay Antani|year=2004|publisher=[[Filmcritic.com]]|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/Raging-Bull|accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Andre Soares|url=http://www.altfg.com/blog/directors/martin-scorsese-on-michelangelo-antonioni/|title=Martin Scorsese on Michelangelo Antonioni|publisher=Altfg.com|date=March 19, 2009|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Ingmar Bergman Foundation|url=http://193.10.144.136/page.asp?guid=65BFD29C-045F-4C51-88B1-1A50F6173D26|title=Ingmar Bergman|publisher=193.10.144.136|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=uysS8EHrpB4|title=Martin Scorsese praises Federico Fellini and 'La Dolce Vita'|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref> His initial desire to become a priest<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/reviews/article-1257300/Shutter-Island-Scorseses-Psycho-stylish-scary-masterpiece.html|title=Scorsese's Psycho is a stylish, scary masterpiece|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=March 11, 2010|accessdate=January 7, 2011|location=London|first=Chris|last=Tookey}}</ref> while attending [[Cardinal Hayes High School]] in the Bronx gave way to cinema and consequently, Scorsese enrolled in NYU's University College of Arts and Science, (now known as the [[NYU College of Arts and Science|College of Arts and Science]]), where he earned a B.A. in English in 1964.

==Career==

===Early career===
Scorsese attended [[New York University]]'s film school (B.A., English, 1964; [[master of fine arts|M.F.A.]], film, 1966)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Martin Scorsese|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/great-directors/scorsese/|work=sensesofcinema.com|first=Marc|last=Raymond|date=May 2002|publisher=[[Senses of Cinema]]|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> making the short films ''[[What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This?]]'' (1963) and ''[[It's Not Just You, Murray!]]'' (1964). His most famous short of the period is the darkly comic ''[[The Big Shave]]'' (1967), which features Peter Bernuth. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], suggested by its alternative title ''Viet '67''.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Finding the boy again|url=http://living.scotsman.com/features/Finding-the-boy-again.2317392.jp|newspaper=The Scotsman|author=Alistair Harkness|date=April 11, 2002}}</ref> Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by his Armenian American film professor [[Haig P. Manoogian]].

In 1967, Scorsese made his first feature-length film, the black and white ''I Call First'', which was later retitled ''[[Who's That Knocking at My Door]]'' with his fellow students actor [[Harvey Keitel]] and editor [[Thelma Schoonmaker]], both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese's semiautobiographical J. R. Trilogy, which also would have included a later film, ''[[Mean Streets]]''.

===1970s===
Scorsese became friends with the influential "movie brats" of the 1970s: [[Brian De Palma]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref name=Adams1 /> It was Brian De Palma who introduced Scorsese to [[Robert De Niro]]. During this period he worked as the assistant director and one of the editors on the documentary ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' (1970) and met actor–director [[John Cassavetes]], who would also go on to become a close friend and mentor.

====''Mean Streets''====
{{Main|Mean Streets}}
In 1972, Scorsese made the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era exploiter ''[[Boxcar Bertha]]'' for [[B-movie]] producer [[Roger Corman]], who also helped directors such as [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[James Cameron]], and [[John Sayles]] launch their careers. It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with very little money or time, preparing the young director well for the challenges to come with ''[[Mean Streets]]''. Following the film's release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make rather than someone else's projects.

Championed by influential film critic [[Pauline Kael]], ''Mean Streets'' was a breakthrough for Scorsese, De Niro, and Keitel. By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority of ''Mean Streets'' was actually shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing and a soundtrack with contemporary music. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, [[Samuel Fuller]] and early [[Jean-Luc Godard]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99967-1991Nov24.html|title=Scorsese, Master Of The Rage|work=The Washington Post|date=November 24, 1991|first=Hal|last=Hinson}}</ref>

In 1974, actress [[Ellen Burstyn]] chose Scorsese to direct her in ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'', for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in the director's early career as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese next came up with ''[[Italianamerican]]'', a documentary featuring his parents Charles and Catherine Scorsese.

====''Taxi Driver''====
{{Main|Taxi Driver}}
''Taxi Driver'' followed in 1976—Scorsese's dark, urban nightmare of one lonely man's slow descent into insanity.

The film established Scorsese as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographer [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors, and complex camera movements. The film starred [[Robert De Niro]] as the troubled and psychotic Travis Bickle. The film co-starred [[Jodie Foster]] in a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute, and [[Harvey Keitel]] as her pimp, Matthew, called "Sport".

''Taxi Driver'' also marked the start of a series of collaborations between Scorsese and writer [[Paul Schrader]], whose influences included the diary of would-be assassin [[Arthur Bremer]] and ''[[Pickpocket (film)|Pickpocket]]'', a film by the French director [[Robert Bresson]]. Writer–director Schrader often returns to Bresson's work in films such as ''[[American Gigolo]]'', ''[[Light Sleeper]]'', and Scorsese's later ''[[Bringing Out the Dead]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thurman|first=John|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/37/taxi_driver/|title=Citizen Bickle, or the Allusive Taxi Driver: Uses of Intertextuality|publisher=Sensesofcinema.com|date=April 5, 1976|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref>

Already controversial upon its release, ''Taxi Driver'' hit the headlines again five years later, when [[John Hinckley, Jr.]] made an assassination attempt on then-president [[Ronald Reagan]]. He subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with Jodie Foster's ''Taxi Driver'' character (in the film, De Niro's character, [[Travis Bickle]], makes an assassination attempt on a senator).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1813797,00.html|title='I was in a bad place'|publisher=Guardian|date=July 6, 2006|location=London|first=Geoffrey|last=MacNab|accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>

''Taxi Driver'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival,<ref>{{cite web|title=Festival Archives: Taxi Driver|url=http://www.festival-cannes.fr/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2123.html|publisher=Festival de Cannes|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}</ref> also receiving four [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], although all were unsuccessful.

Scorsese was subsequently offered the role of [[Charles Manson]] in the film ''[[Helter Skelter (1976 film)|Helter Skelter]]'' and a part in [[Sam Fuller]]'s war film ''[[The Big Red One]]'', but he turned both down. However, he did accept the role of a gangster in the exploitation film ''[[Cannonball (film)|Cannonball]]'', directed by [[Paul Bartel]]. In this period there were also several directorial projects that never got off the ground including ''Haunted Summer'', about [[Mary Shelley]] and a film with [[Marlon Brando]] about the Indian massacre at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]].

====''New York, New York'' and ''The Last Waltz''====
{{Main|New York, New York (film)|The Last Waltz}}
The critical success of ''Taxi Driver'' encouraged Scorsese to move ahead with his first big-budget project: the highly stylized musical ''New York, New York''. This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure.

''New York, New York'' was the director's third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with [[Liza Minnelli]]. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work.

Despite its weak reception, the film is positively regarded by some critics. Richard Brody in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote: "For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies. Remarkably, his backward-looking tribute to the golden age of musicals and noirish romantic melodramas turned out to be one of his most freewheeling and personal films."<ref>{{cite news |last=Brody |first=Richard |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/events/revivals/2008/01/28/080128gomo_GOAT_movies_brody |title=Top of the Heap |work=[[The New Yorker]] |agency=DVD Notes (column) |date=January 28, 2008 |accessdate=July 25, 2013}}</ref>

The disappointing reception that ''New York, New York'' received drove Scorsese into depression. By this stage the director had also developed a serious cocaine addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', documenting the final concert by [[The Band]]. It was held at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Ronnie Wood]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978.

Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titled ''[[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|American Boy]]'', also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in ''Taxi Driver''. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director's already fragile health.

Scorsese also helped provide footage for the documentary ''[[Elvis on Tour]]''.

===1980s===

====''Raging Bull''====
{{Main|Raging Bull}}
By several accounts (Scorsese's included), Robert De Niro practically saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded Scorsese to kick his [[cocaine]] addiction to make his highly regarded film ''Raging Bull''. Convinced that he would never make another movie, he poured his energies into making this violent biopic of middleweight boxing champion [[Jake LaMotta]], calling it a [[Kamikaze]] method of film-making.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,867652,00.html|title='Are we ever going to make this picture?'|publisher=Guardian|date=January 3, 2003|first=Alex|last=Williams|location=London}}</ref> The film is widely viewed as a masterpiece and was voted the greatest film of the 1980s by Britain's ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Century_Of_Films/Story/0,,112416,00.html|title=Martin Scorsese: Raging Bull|publisher=Guardian|date=December 9, 1999|first=Derek|last=Malcolm|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-02-07-dvd-raging-bull_x.htm|title='Raging Bull' returns to the ring|work=USA Today|date=February 7, 2005|first=Mike|last=Snider}}</ref> It received eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Robert De Niro, and Scorsese's first for [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]]. De Niro won, as did [[Thelma Schoonmaker]] for editing, but Best Director went to [[Robert Redford]] for ''[[Ordinary People]]''.

''Raging Bull'', filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith: ''Taxi Driver'' and ''New York, New York'' had used elements of [[expressionism]] to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html|title=Raging Bull|publisher=Eufs.org.uk|date=March 5, 2001|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> Thematically too, the concerns carried on from ''Mean Streets'' and ''Taxi Driver'': insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.

Although the screenplay for ''Raging Bull'' was credited to Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin (who earlier co-wrote ''Mean Streets''), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft. It was rewritten several times by various writers including [[Jay Cocks]] (who went on to co-script later Scorsese films ''[[The Age of Innocence (1993 film)|The Age of Innocence]]'' and ''[[Gangs of New York]]''). The final draft was largely written by Scorsese and Robert De Niro.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Ageing bulls return|publisher=Observer|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,,98151,00.html|date=October 31, 1999|first=Mark|last=Morris|location=London}}</ref>

The [[American Film Institute]] chose ''Raging Bull'' as the No. 1 American sports film on [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Sports|their list of the top 10 sports films]]. In 1997, the Institute ranked ''Raging Bull'' as the 24th greatest film of all time on their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]] list. In 2007, they ranked ''Raging Bull'' as the 4th greatest film of all time on their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]] list.

====''The King of Comedy''====
{{Main|The King of Comedy (1983 film)}}
Scorsese's next project was his fifth collaboration with Robert De Niro, ''[[The King of Comedy (1983 film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983). A [[satire]] on the world of media and celebrity, it was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had developed up until this point, often using a static camera and long takes.<ref>{{cite web|author=evil jimi|url=http://www.ehrensteinland.com/htmls/library/koc.html|title=The King of Comedy|publisher=Ehrensteinland.com|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> The expressionism of his recent work here gave way to moments of almost total [[surrealism]]. It still bore many of Scorsese's trademarks, however, such as its focus on a troubled loner who ironically becomes famous through a criminal act (murder and [[kidnapping]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/78730.html|title=The King of Comedy Film Review|publisher=Timeout.com|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref>

''The King of Comedy'' failed at the box office, but has become increasingly well regarded by critics in the years since its release. German director [[Wim Wenders]] numbered it among his 15 favorite films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wim-wenders.com/news_reel/2002/apr02-directorsonfilm.htm|title=The Official Site|publisher=Wim Wenders|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref>

====''After Hours''====
{{Main|After Hours (film)}}
After the collapse of this project Scorsese again saw his career at a critical point, as he described in the documentary ''Filming for Your Life: Making 'After Hours{{'-}}'' (2004). He saw that in the increasingly commercial world of 1980s Hollywood, the highly stylized and personal 1970s films he and others had built their careers on would not continue to enjoy the same status. Scorsese decided then on an almost totally new approach to his work. With ''After Hours'' (1985) he made an aesthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost "underground" film-making style—his way of staying viable. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor ([[Griffin Dunne]]) and featured cameos by such disparate actors as [[Teri Garr]] and [[Cheech and Chong]]. A bit of a stylistic anomaly for Scorsese, ''After Hours'' fits in well with popular low-budget cult films of the 1980s, e.g. [[Jonathan Demme]]'s ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]'' and [[Alex Cox]]'s ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]''.

====''The Color of Money''====
{{Main|The Color of Money}}
Along with the 1987 [[Michael Jackson]] music video "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)#Music video|Bad]]," in 1986 Scorsese made ''The Color of Money'', a sequel to the much admired [[Robert Rossen]] film ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'' (1961) with [[Paul Newman]], which co-starred [[Tom Cruise]]. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style, ''The Color of Money'' was the director's first official foray into [[mainstream]] film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: ''The Last Temptation of Christ''.

====''The Last Temptation of Christ''====
{{Main|The Last Temptation of Christ (film)}}

In 1983, Scorsese began work on a long-cherished personal project, ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'', based on the 1951 (English translation 1960) novel written by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], who was introduced to the director by actress [[Barbara Hershey]] when they were both attending [[New York University]] in the late 1960s. The film was slated to shoot under the [[Paramount Pictures]] banner, but shortly before principal photography was to commence, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, [[Aidan Quinn]] was cast as Jesus, and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was cast as [[Pontius Pilate]]. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played respectively by [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[David Bowie]].)

After his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal film-making with the [[Paul Schrader]]–scripted ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' in 1988. Based on [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]'s controversial 1960 book, it retold the life of [[Christ]] in human rather than divine terms. Even prior to its release the film caused a massive furor, worldwide protests against its [[blasphemy]] effectively turning a low budget independent movie into a media sensation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html|title=Martin Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ|publisher=Pbs.org|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> Most controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with [[Mary Magdalene]] in a [[Satan]]-induced [[hallucination]] while on the cross.

Looking past the controversy, ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to Barry Levinson for ''[[Rain Man]]'').

====Other works in 1980s====

Scorsese made a brief [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Anna Pavlova (film)|Anna Pavlova]]'' (also known as ''A Woman for All Time''), originally intended to be directed by one of his heroes, [[Michael Powell]]. This led to a more significant role in [[Bertrand Tavernier]]'s [[jazz]] film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''.

He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.

Along with directors [[Woody Allen]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]], in 1989 Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film ''[[New York Stories]]'', called "Life Lessons".

===1990s===

====''Goodfellas''====
{{Main|Goodfellas}}
After a decade of mostly mixed results, gangster epic ''Goodfellas'' (1990) was a return to form for Scorsese and his most confident and fully realized film since ''Raging Bull''. De Niro and [[Joe Pesci]] offered a virtuoso display of the director's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released [[Roger Ebert]], a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named ''Goodfellas'' "the best mob movie ever" and is ranked No. 1 on Roger's movie list for 1990, along with [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Peter Travers]], the film is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900902/REVIEWS/9020301/1023|title=:: rogerebert.com :: Reviews :: GoodFellas (xhtml)|publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089|title=GoodFellas|publisher=Hollywoodreporter.com|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071011152454rn_2/www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html|title=GoodFellas (1990)|publisher=Filmsite.org|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref>

The film was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], Scorsese earned his third [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] nomination for ''Goodfellas'' but again lost to a first-time director, [[Kevin Costner]] (''[[Dances with Wolves]]''). Joe Pesci earned the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in ''Goodfellas''. Scorsese and the film won numerous awards, including five [[BAFTA]] Awards, a [[Silver Lion]] and more.

The [[American Film Institute]] put ''Goodfellas'' at No. 94 on the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list]]. On the 2007 updated version they moved ''Goodfellas'' up to No. 92 on the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition)]] and they put ''Goodfellas'' at No. 2 on [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Gangster|their list of the top 10 gangster films]] (after ''[[The Godfather]]'').

====''Cape Fear''====
{{Main|Cape Fear (1991 film)}}
1991 brought ''Cape Fear'', a remake of a cult [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|1962 movie]] of the same name, and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Charles Laughton]]'s ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955). ''Cape Fear'' received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting [[misogynistic]] violence. However, the lurid subject matter did give Scorsese a chance to experiment with a dazzling array of visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it would stand as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until ''The Aviator'' (2004), and then ''The Departed'' (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.

====''The Age of Innocence''====
{{Main|The Age of Innocence (1993 film)}}
''The Age of Innocence'' (1993) was a huge departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of [[The Age of Innocence|Edith Wharton's novel]] about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon original release, but was a [[box office bomb]], making an overall loss. As noted in ''Scorsese on Scorsese'' by editor–interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.

Scorsese was interested in doing a "romantic piece". His friend [[Jay Cocks]] gave him the Wharton novel in 1980, suggesting that this should be the romantic piece Scorsese should film as Cocks felt it best represented his sensibility. In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'' he noted that

::Although the film deals with New York aristocracy and a period of New York history that has been neglected, and although it deals with code and ritual, and with love that's not unrequited but unconsummated—which pretty much covers all the themes I usually deal with—when I read the book, I didn't say, "Oh good, all those themes are here."

Scorsese, who was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text, wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this aim, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that made an emotional impact on him. In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', he documents influences from films such as [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'' and his ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' as well as [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' and also [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[La prise de pouvoir par Louis XIV]]''. Although ''The Age of Innocence'' was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films.

It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including for Scorsese for Best Adapted Screenplay), winning the Costume Design Oscar.

This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award–winning actor [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], with whom he would work again in ''Gangs of New York''.

====''Casino''====
{{Main|Casino (film)}}
1995's expansive ''Casino'', like ''The Age of Innocence'' before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. ''Casino'' was a box office success,<ref name="variety-gross">http://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/</ref> but the film received mixed notices from critics. In large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier ''Goodfellas'', and its excessive violence that garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film ever made. Indeed many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Pesci once again being an unbridled psychopath. [[Sharon Stone]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Academy Award]] for her performance.

During the filming Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.

====''A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies''====
{{Main|A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies}}
Scorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995 offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career, stating, "I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries." In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D.W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler—filmmakers such as Douglas Sirk, Samuel Fuller, and Vincente Minnelli, who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast.

====''Kundun''====
{{Main|Kundun}}
If ''The Age of Innocence'' alienated and confused some fans, then ''Kundun'' (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]], the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s entering of [[Tibet]], and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not least a departure in subject matter, ''Kundun'' also saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate [[tableau vivant|tableau]] of colorful visual images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html|title=Kundun|publisher=Time Out|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref>

The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]], which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting ''Kundun''<nowiki>’</nowiki>s commercial profile.

In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it generally appears ''Kundun'' has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. ''Kundun'' was the director's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following ''The Last Temptation of Christ''.

====''Bringing Out the Dead''====
{{Main|Bringing Out the Dead}}
<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Botd full.jpg|thumb|Scorsese back to neo-noir in ''Bringing Out the Dead'' (1999).]] -->
''Bringing Out the Dead'' (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier ''Taxi Driver''.<ref>{{cite web|title=New York Stories: A Complete Ranking of Martin Scorsese’s Films   Read More: Ranking Martin Scorsese's Movies From Best to Worst|url=http://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/|publisher=Screen Crush|accessdate=18 April 2014}}</ref> Like previous Scorsese–Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalled the films of Robert Bresson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert|title=Reinert on Bringing Out the Dead|publisher=Film-philosophy.com|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> (It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of ''After Hours''.) It received generally positive reviews,<ref>rottentomatoes.com, [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bringing_out_the_dead/ Bringing Out the Dead Entry]. Retrieved January 29, 2007.</ref> although not the universal critical acclaim of some of his other films. It stars [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Ving Rhames]], [[John Goodman]], [[Tom Sizemore]], and [[Patricia Arquette]].

====Other works in 1990s====

In 1990, Scorsese acted in a cameo role as [[Vincent van Gogh]] in the film ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' by Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]].

Since the 1990s, Scorsese has increased his role as a film producer.  Scorsese produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]'', ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]''), low-budget independent films (''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'' , ''[[Naked in New York]]'',  ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'', ''[[Search and Destroy]]'', ''[[The Hi-Lo Country]]''), and even foreign film (''[[Con gli occhi chiusi]]'').

===2000s===

====''Gangs of New York''====
{{Main|Gangs of New York}}
[[File:Leo Scor Diaz(GangsofNY)-.jpg|thumb|Scorsese at the ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' screening at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Cameron Diaz]]]]
In 1999 Scorsese also produced a documentary on Italian filmmakers titled ''Il Mio Viaggio in Italia'', also known as ''[[My Voyage to Italy]]''. The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as [[Luchino Visconti]] and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous [[Cinecittà]] film studios.

With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, ''Gangs of New York'' was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like ''The Age of Innocence'', it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]). The film also marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who since then has become a fixture in later Scorsese films.

The production was highly troubled, with many rumors referring to the director's conflict with [[Miramax]] boss [[Harvey Weinstein]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,860378,00.html|title=Gangs of Los Angeles &#124; News &#124; Guardian Unlimited Film|publisher=Film.guardian.co.uk|date=December 15, 2002|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=London}}</ref> Despite denials of artistic compromise, ''Gangs of New York'' revealed itself to be the director's most conventional film: standard film tropes that the director had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely for [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] purposes and explanatory [[flashback (literary technique)|flashbacks]], here surfaced in abundance.<ref name="guardian_film_of_the_week">{{Cite news|author=Peter Bradshaw|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,871400,00.html|title=Gangs of New York &#124; Reviews &#124; Guardian Unlimited Film|publisher=Film.guardian.co.uk|date=January 10, 2003|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epinions.com/content_136317079172|title=Compare Prices and Read Reviews on Gangs of New York at|publisher=Epinions.com|date=July 1, 2003|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author=Xan Brooks|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,871715,00.html|title=Past master &#124; Features &#124; Guardian Unlimited Film|publisher=Film.guardian.co.uk|date=January 9, 2003|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=London}}</ref> The original score composed by regular Scorsese collaborator [[Elmer Bernstein]] was rejected at a late stage for a score by [[Howard Shore]] and mainstream rock artists [[U2]] and [[Peter Gabriel]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Listening to the Academy Awards: Oscar-Nominated Film Scores|url=http://www.npr.org/news/specials/oscars2002/scores.html|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=18 April 2014|year=2002}}</ref> The final cut of the movie ran to 168 minutes, while the director's original cut was over 180 minutes in length.<ref name="guardian_film_of_the_week" /> The film still received generally positive reviews with the review tallying website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reporting that 75 percent of the reviews they tallied for the film were positive and summarizing the critics by saying, "Though flawed, the sprawling, messy Gangs of New York is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gangs_of_new_york/|title=Gangs of New York|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref>

Nonetheless, the themes central to the film were consistent with the director's established concerns: New York, violence as culturally endemic, and subcultural divisions down ethnic lines.

Originally filmed for a release in the winter of 2001 (to qualify for Academy Award nominations), Scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of 2002; the studio consequently delayed the film for nearly a year until its release in the [[Oscar season]] of late 2002.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,680795,00.html|title=In briefs: Gangs of New York release delayed again|publisher=Film.guardian.co.uk|date=April 8, 2002|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=London}}</ref>

''Gangs of New York'' earned Scorsese his first Golden Globe for Best Director. In February 2003, ''Gangs of New York'' received 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]; however, it did not win in any category.

====''The Blues''====
{{Main|The Blues (film)}}
The following year Scorsese completed production of ''[[The Blues (film)|The Blues]]'', an expansive seven-part documentary tracing the history of blues music from its African roots to the Mississippi Delta and beyond. Seven film-makers including [[Wim Wenders]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Mike Figgis]], and Scorsese himself each contributed a 90-minute film (Scorsese's entry was titled "Feel Like Going Home").

====''The Aviator''====
{{Main|The Aviator (2004 film)}}
Scorsese's film ''The Aviator'' (2004) is a lavish, large-scale [[biopic]] of eccentric aviation pioneer and film mogul [[Howard Hughes]] and reunited Scorsese with actor Leonardo DiCaprio. The film received highly positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/aviator/ |title=The Aviator |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author=Brian Libby|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/salon/0,,1404293,00.html|title=Are you talking to me – again?|publisher=Film.guardian.co.uk|date=February 2, 2005|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Right-guy-wrong-film/2005/02/25/1109180100911.html|title=Right guy, wrong film|publisher=Theage.com.au|date=February 27, 2005|accessdate=March 3, 2010|location=Melbourne}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=10596|title=Empire Reviews Central – Review of The Aviator|publisher=Empireonline.com|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=(Posted: December 15, 2004)|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/6143001/review/6769078/the_aviator|title=Aviator : Review|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=December 15, 2004|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> The film also met with widespread box office success and gained Academy recognition.

''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' was nominated for six [[Golden Globe awards]], including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture—Drama]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]], and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor—Motion Picture Drama]] for [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. It won three, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture—Drama]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor—Motion Picture Drama]]. In January 2005 ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' became the most-nominated film of the [[77th Academy Awards]] nominations, nominated in 11 categories including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. The film also garnered nominations in nearly all of the other major categories, including a fifth [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]] nomination for Scorsese, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] (Leonardo DiCaprio), [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] ([[Cate Blanchett]]), and [[Alan Alda]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]]. Despite having a leading tally, the film ended up with only five Oscars: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]], [[Academy Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]]. Scorsese lost again, this time to director [[Clint Eastwood]] for ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (which also won Best Picture).

====''No Direction Home''====
{{Main|No Direction Home}}
''No Direction Home'' is a documentary film by Martin Scorsese that tells of the life of [[Bob Dylan]], and his impact on American popular music and culture of the 20th century. The film does not cover Dylan's entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then-[[Electric Dylan controversy|controversial transformation]] from an acoustic guitar–based musician and performer to an electric guitar–influenced sound and his "retirement" from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident.
The film was first presented on television in both the United States (as part of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[American Masters]]'' series) and the United Kingdom (as part of the [[BBC Two]] ''[[Arena (TV series)|Arena]]'' series) on September 26–27, 2005. A DVD version of the film was released that same month.
The film won a Peabody Award and the [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]]. In addition, Scorsese received an [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy]] nomination for it.

====''The Departed''====
{{Main|The Departed}}
Scorsese returned to the crime genre with the Boston-set thriller ''The Departed'', based on the Hong Kong police drama ''[[Infernal Affairs]]'' (which is co-directed by [[Andrew Lau]] and [[Alan Mak (director)|Alan Mak]]) . The film continued Scorsese's collaboration streak with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], and was his first collaboration with [[Matt Damon]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Mark Wahlberg]], and [[Martin Sheen]].

''The Departed'' opened to widespread critical acclaim, with some proclaiming it as one of the best efforts Scorsese had brought to the screen since 1990s ''[[Goodfellas]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chud.com/index.php?type=reviews&id=7778|title=Review: Departed, The|publisher=Chud.com|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=15256&reviewer=198|title=Movie Review – Departed, The|publisher=eFilmCritic|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> and still others putting it at the same level as Scorsese's most celebrated classics ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Raging Bull''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/d/departed.html|title=Reel Views|publisher=Reel Views|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/the-departed-310756/review|title=All Movie – The Departed|publisher=Allmovie.com|date=October 6, 2006|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref>
With domestic box office receipts surpassing $129,402,536, ''The Departed'' was Scorsese's highest grossing film (not accounting for inflation) until 2010s ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]''.

Martin Scorsese's direction of ''The Departed'' earned him his second Golden Globe for Best Director, as well as a Critics' Choice Award, his first [[Directors Guild of America]] Award, and the [[Academy Award]] for Best Director. While being presented with the award, Scorsese said, "Could you double-check the envelope?" It was presented to him by his longtime friends and colleagues [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[George Lucas]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]. ''The Departed'' also received the Academy Award for the Best Motion Picture of 2006, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing by longtime Scorsese editor [[Thelma Schoonmaker]], her third win for a Scorsese film.

====''Shine a Light''====
{{Main|Shine a Light (film)}}
[[File:Martin Scorsese by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|upright|Martin Scorsese at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in 2007]]

''Shine a Light'' is a concert film of [[rock and roll]] band [[The Rolling Stones]]' performances at New York City's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theater]] on October 29 and November 1, 2006, intercut with brief news and interview footage from throughout the band's career.

The film was initially scheduled for release on September 21, 2007, but [[Paramount Classics]] postponed its general release until April 2008. Its world premiere was at the opening of the 58th [[Berlinale]] Film Festival on February 7, 2008.

====Other works in 2000s====

In 2000s, Scorsese produced several films for upcoming directors, such as ''[[You Can Count on Me]]'' (directed by [[Kenneth Lonergan]]),  ''Rain'' (directed by Katherine Lindberg), ''[[Lymelife]]'' (directed by [[Derick Martini]]) and ''[[The Young Victoria]]'' (directed by [[Jean-Marc Vallée]]).

Scorsese also produced several documentaries, such as ''[[The Soul of a Man]]'' (directed by [[Wim Wenders]]) and ''[[Lightning in a Bottle (film)|Lightning in a Bottle]]'' (directed by [[Antoine Fuqua]])..

==Director trademarks==
* Frequent use of slow motion, e.g. ''Who's That Knocking at My Door'' (1967), ''Mean Streets'' (1973), ''Taxi Driver'' (1976), ''Raging Bull'' (1980), ''Goodfellas'' (1990), and ''The Wolf of Wall Street'' (2013).<ref>[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2002/great-directors/scorsese/ Martin Scorsese] by Marc Raymond, ''Senses of Cinema'' (online), May 2002</ref> Also known for using [[freeze frame shot|freeze frame]], such as the opening credits of ''The King of Comedy'' (1983), and throughout ''Goodfellas'' (1990). Such a shot is also used in ''Casino'' (1995) and ''The Departed'' (2006).
* His blonde leading ladies are usually seen through the eyes of the protagonist as angelic and ethereal; they wear white in their first scene and are photographed in slow motion ([[Cybill Shepherd]] in ''Taxi Driver''; [[Cathy Moriarty]]'s white bikini in ''Raging Bull''; [[Sharon Stone]]'s white minidress in ''Casino'').<ref>[http://www.frankiesfilms.com/html/martin_scorsese.html Martin Scorsese], ''Frankie's Films'' (online), January 2007</ref> This may possibly be a nod to director Alfred Hitchcock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tours/hitch/tour8.html|title=Hitchcock and Women|publisher=Screenonline.org.uk|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref>
* Often uses long tracking shots.<ref name="bostonglobe">{{Cite news|first=Jake|last=Coyle|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2007/12/29/atonement_brings_the_long_tracking_shot_back_into_focus/?page=1|title="Atonement" brings the long tracking shot back into focus|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=December 29, 2007}}</ref> Example: ''Taxi Driver'', ''Goodfellas'', ''Casino'', ''Gangs of New York'', ''Hugo''.
* Use of [[MOS (film)|MOS]] sequences set to popular music or voice-over, often involving aggressive camera movement and/or rapid editing.<ref>[https://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/martin_scorseses_comfortable_state_of_anxiety_3290/ Martin Scorsese’s Comfortable State of Anxiety]{{dead link|date=January 2014}} by Timothy Rhys, ''[[MovieMaker Magazine]]'' (online), October 16, 2002</ref>
* Often has a quick cameo in his films (''Who's That Knocking at My Door'', ''Mean Streets'', ''Taxi Driver'', ''The King of Comedy'', ''After Hours'', ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' (albeit hidden under a hood), ''The Age of Innocence'', ''Gangs of New York'', ''Hugo''). Also, often contributes his voice to a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as in ''The Wolf of Wall Street''). He provides the opening voice-over narration in ''Mean Streets'' and ''The Color of Money''; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene of ''Raging Bull''; provides the voice of the unseen ambulance dispatcher in ''Bringing Out the Dead''.<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/directorcameos1.html Most Famous Film Director Cameos] by Tim Dirks, [[Filmsite.org]] (online), 2008</ref>
* Sometimes highlights characters in a scene with an iris, an homage to 1920s [[silent film]] cinema (as scenes at the time sometimes used this transition). This effect can be seen in ''Casino'' (it is used on [[Sharon Stone]] and [[Joe Pesci]]), ''Life Lessons'', ''The Departed'' (on [[Matt Damon]]), and ''Hugo''.
* Some of his films include references/allusions to westerns, particularly ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'', ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', and ''[[The Oklahoma Kid]]''.
* More recently, his films have featured corrupt authority figures, such as policemen in ''The Departed''<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/10/11/revisiting_southies_culture_of_death/ "Revisiting Southie's culture of death"], Michael Patrick MacDonald, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' (online), October 11, 2006</ref> and politicians in ''Gangs of New York''<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021220/REVIEWS/212200304/1023 "Gangs of New York Review"], [[Roger Ebert]], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' (online), December 20, 2002</ref> and ''The Aviator''.<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/12/20/041220crci_cinema "High Rollers"], David Denby, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (online), December 20, 2004</ref>
* Guilt is a prominent theme in many of his films, as is the role of Catholicism in creating and dealing with guilt (''Raging Bull'', ''Goodfellas'', ''Bringing Out the Dead'', ''Mean Streets'', ''Who's That Knocking at My Door'', ''The Departed'', ''Shutter Island'').
* Slow motion flashbulbs and accented camera/flash/shutter sounds.
* The song "[[Gimme Shelter]]" by [[The Rolling Stones]] is heard in several of Scorsese's films: ''Goodfellas'', ''Casino'', and ''The Departed''.

==Frequent collaborators==
Scorsese often casts the same actors in his films, particularly [[Robert De Niro]], who collaborated with Scorsese for eight films. Included are the three films (''Taxi Driver'', ''Raging Bull'', and ''Goodfellas'') that made [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies]] list. Scorsese has often said he thinks De Niro's best work under his direction was Rupert Pupkin in ''[[The King of Comedy (1983 film)|The King of Comedy]]''. After the turn of the century, Scorsese found a new muse with younger actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], collaborating for five films to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.go.com/moviesproxy/tipster?id=922715|title=Leo & Marty: Yes, Again!|publisher=Movies.go.com|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> Several critics have compared Scorsese's new partnership with DiCaprio with his previous one with De Niro.<ref>{{wayback|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/entertainment-blog/2007/01/29/scorsese-likens-dicaprio-to-de-niro/|date=20080414160748|title=Scorsese Likens DiCaprio To De Niro}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20164049,00.html|title=Successful Hollywood Duos|publisher=Ew.com|date=November 30, 2007|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> Other frequent collaborators include [[Victor Argo]] (6), [[Harry Northup]] (6), [[Harvey Keitel]] (5), Murray Moston (5), [[J. C. Mackenzie]] (3), [[Joe Pesci]] (3), [[Frank Vincent]] (3) and [[Verna Bloom]] (3). [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], who had become very reclusive to the Hollywood scene, [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Jude Law]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Frank Sivero]], and [[Ray Winstone]] have also appeared in multiple Scorsese films. Before their deaths, Scorsese's parents, Charles Scorsese and [[Catherine Scorsese]], appeared in bit parts, walk-ons or supporting roles, most notably in ''Goodfellas''.

For his crew, Scorsese frequently worked with editor [[Thelma Schoonmaker]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Labrecque|first=Jeff|title='Wolf of Wall Street's Thelma Schoonmaker on her historic partnership with Martin Scorsese|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/02/11/wolf-of-wall-street-dicaprio-scorsese-thelma-schoonmaker/|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=11 February 2014}}</ref> cinematographers [[Michael Ballhaus]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Bosley|first=Rachael K.|url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/jan03/native/index.html|title=Michael Ballhaus, ASC takes on Martin Scorsese's ''Gangs of New York'', a 19th-century tale of vengeance and valor set in the city’s most notorious neighborhood|publisher=Theasc.com|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], and [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], screenwriters [[Paul Schrader]], Mardik Martin, and [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]], costume designer [[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]], production designer [[Dante Ferretti]], music producer [[Robbie Robertson]], and composers [[Howard Shore]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scorsesefilms.com/aviator.htm|title=The Aviator|publisher=Scorsese Films|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> and [[Elmer Bernstein]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=Stuart|url=http://www.elmerbernstein.com/news/haynes_scorsese.html|title=Some You Win|publisher=Elmerbernstein.com|date=January 6, 2003|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}</ref> Schoonmaker, Richardson, Powell, and Ferretti have all won Academy Awards in their respective categories on collaborations with Scorsese. Elaine and [[Saul Bass]], the latter being Hitchcock's frequent title designer, designed the opening credits for ''Goodfellas'', ''The Age of Innocence'', ''Casino'' and ''Cape Fear''.
He was the executive producer of the film ''[[Brides (2004 film)|Brides]]'', which was directed by Pantelis Voulgaris and starred [[Victoria Haralabidou]], [[Damian Lewis]], [[Steven Berkoff]], and Kosta Sommer.
