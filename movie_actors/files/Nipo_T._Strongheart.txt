'''Nipo T. Strongheart''' (born May 15, 1891, in [[White Swan, Washington]]; died December 31, 1966, in [[Hollywood]], California) was a [[Yakama Nation]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] lecturer and performer and a [[technical advisor]] to Hollywood film producers. Throughout his life, which spanned several careers, he was an advocate for Native American issues. He spoke on religious issues several times and late in life became a member of the [[Bahá'í Faith]].

Strongheart's mother, Chi-Nach-Lut Schu-Wah-Elks, was a member of the Yakama Nation. He was exposed to native culture through performing with his father in [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show]] and its successors; according to some sources Strongheart spent most of his childhood with his white father away from the reservation and Indian culture;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yakimaherald.com/photosandvideos/localphotos/2398419-8/nipo-strongheart-exhibit-shows-pride-for-his-people|title=Nipo Strongheart exhibit shows pride for his people|author=Kate Prengaman|publisher=Yakima Herald|date=10 August 2014}}</ref> other sources say he was adopted by a Yakima woman, and brought up and educated on the reservation.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.fofweb.com/History/HistRefMain.asp?iPin=ENAIT489&SID=2&DatabaseName=American+Indian+History+Online&InputText=%22scout%22&SearchStyle=&dTitle=Strongheart%2C+Nipo&TabRecordType=Biography&BioCountPass=227&SubCountPass=220&DocCountPass=7&ImgCountPass=13&MapCountPass=1&FedCountPass=&MedCountPass=14&NewsCountPass=0&RecPosition=191&AmericanData=&WomenData=&AFHCData=&IndianData=Set&WorldData=&AncientData=&GovernmentData=|title=Encyclopedia of the American Indian in the Twentieth Century|chapter=Nipo Strongheart|author=Alexander Ewen and Jeffrey Wollock|publisher= Facts On File, Inc|date=2014}}</ref> Strongheart's public performances began in 1917 when he worked for the [[YMCA]] War Work Council. He toured military camps across New England, where he gave presentations on Native American culture and spoke seriously about military service. His talks encouraged hundreds of men to volunteer for war service. After World War I and his job ended, Strongheart moved briefly to the [[Yakama Indian Reservation]] but left again and had a successful career in the [[Lyceum movement|Lyceum]] and [[Chautauqua]] circuits of fairs, where he gave presentations on Native American culture and often spoke against the [[Native Americans and reservation inequality|reservation lifestyle]] enforced by government policy. He played an important role in the development of the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]] signed by President [[Calvin Coolidge]], which he thought would help end reservations and empower Indian culture.

In his early youth, Strongheart had already had experience with the fledgling [[film industry]] and began to focus his career in that field as the audiences of Lyceum and Chautauqua events dwindled. He was involved in a number of projects in [[silent film]] (especially ''[[Braveheart (1925 film)|Braveheart]]'') and the developing [[talkies]]  (especially ''[[Pony Soldier]]''). He also helped develop or found a number of organizations centering on Native Americans, including the Los Angeles Indian Center and the still-existing [[National Congress of American Indians]]. Through Strongheart's involvement in film production he was able to counter [[Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America|stereotypes about Native Americans]]; he often translated movie scripts into the language of the Native American peoples portrayed, and also dealt with wardrobe and props.

When Strongheart died, his will included provision for seed money and materials to allow the Yakama Nation to build a library and museum, which became the Yakama Cultural Center. The Yakama Nation established a permanent exhibition about Strongheart in 2014. Scholars began to mention him in 1997 when discussing the military service of Native Americans, and in 2006 when discussing the problems of Native Americans in the Hollywood film industry.

From 1921 Strongheart embarked on an extended series of lectures-cum-performances as part of the [[Lyceum movement|Lyceum]] and [[Chautauqua]] fairs held across the United States.

===Advocacy===
====Advocacy through talks====
Strongheart's talks often used local references and criticized named officials, earning him the censure of the Indian Office and his employers.<ref name="Fisher-at-Oregon"/> But these difficulties were overcome and Strongheart was able to continue, though not "naming names" as much.<ref name=Muntz2006/>{{rp|p76-79}} Overall he gathered tens of thousands of signatures in support of Indian rights in the petitions he presented at his traveling performances.<ref name=YHR2014/> Some of his trips into Pennsylvania were in support of Melville Clyde Kelly, who had a district there.<ref name=Muntz2006/>{{rp|pp. 26, 50}} The petitions and other advocacy work helped pass the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924, but<ref name=Muntz2006/>{{rp|p41}} he continued to campaign for the abolition of supervision by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, something largely achieved with [[Native American self-determination]] in the 1970s.

In one of Strongheart's first talks that were reported in newspapers, held on August 10, 1918, he shook hands with a Chippewa soldier and other servicemen. Later, when was interviewed by the reporter, he quoted government figures indicating a broad nationalism among the Indians – that 10,000 of the roughly 100,000 Indians had volunteered for war service, and that Indians at home had subscribed to [[Liberty Loans]] for ten million dollars to support the war effort. Thousands served in the Red Cross, and by making clothing and bandages. He also said the Indians had used camouflage long before its alleged invention by the French, but others had misinterpreted it as the body painting of savages.<ref>{{cite news

In Rhode Island he addressed the [[Newport Tower (Rhode Island)|Newport Tower]] mystery, saying, "the red man has always been a believer in education and civilization". He referred to the Great Spirit guiding Indians to peace and the ceremony of the Peace Pipe and suggested that the tower was such a temple, comparing it with other native American structures across North and South America.<ref name=OldStone/>

An article from 1919 states, "With all the eloquence of his race&nbsp;... [he] pleaded&nbsp;... for the freedom of his people and advocated the right of citizenship for them&nbsp;... Strongheart flayed the white race for its treatment of the red man, advocated allowing his people to leave the reservations and told with pardonable pride, of their fine war record".<ref>{{cite news

To an audience in 1921 he "revealed many appalling facts regarding the present day treatment of Indians&nbsp;... Following the lecture many people signed a petition asking Congress to give the Indians the right to vote." according to the newspaper report. His performance piece "From Peace Pipe to War Trail and Back Again" was characterized as evoking the "nobility, patience, inherent goodness, romance, traditions, faith and suffering of his people." In another instance he was reported as saying that he was "...&nbsp; spending his life in a work that would tend to bring about a better understanding between the white man and his people".<ref>{{cite news

Another report of Strongheart's talk said he criticized white education, saying:<blockquote> "[it]&nbsp;... deprives the child of individuality and that too many subjects are taught and not taught thoroughly; that education is delayed too long; while the Indian child learns from earliest infancy.&nbsp;... Indians were more strict in the matter of morals, the Indian boys as well as the girls being taught to keep themselves pure and to honor and protect women&nbsp;... The [Indian] only killing for food while the [white man] kills for the fun of the thing. This has resulted in the loss of vast quantities of game.&nbsp;... showed why the placing of the Indians on reservations had resulted in their impaired health&nbsp;... canned food had proved to be detrimental to the health.&nbsp;... Many injustices had been perpetrated as the shutting off of irrigation water&nbsp;... The custom of sending children away from their parents to boarding schools has been fatal to the children and resulted in tragedies.&nbsp;... 'sixty years ago the government granted the franchise to the colored race which is denied to the original Americans which now owing to their enforced stay on reservations have now dwindled to 196,000 Indians. The alien and colored children are in the white men's schools while the Indian children are required to be in separate schools. We believe if we are good enough to fight for you we have a right to be free. We ask for franchise and release from the reservations.<ref name=Oxnard>{{cite news

{{quote|'I traveled through Reno, Nev.' writes Strongheart. 'I saw a very old lady of the Payutes seated on the sidewalk doing a little basket work to sell things. A number of passers-by stopped, watched her; some of the so-called white men remarked in a most insulting manner, and laughed at the expense of our poor beloved people&nbsp;... One old, old man was there. He was hungry,' says Strongheart. 'I gave him a silver dollar, and tears rolled down his cheeks. He said "This is the first money I have seen in many years. Uncle Sam promised me grub and bed, but I sleep in the dust and I am always hungry."'<ref name=WT1922>{{cite news

At [[Stratford High School (Connecticut)]] in 1926 Stronheart's talk began with some introductory remarks about early history and then began to:
{{quote|...&nbsp;describe the changes that took place as the red man was driven westward and the decline of this once great race until at last they were forced to accept the dictates of the white man's government, and relinquish jurisdiction on the reservations set aside for them.&nbsp;... his people were confined to the reservation for a period of 25 years. Their business and legal affairs were all to be handled by an agent responsible only to the Bureau of Indian Affairs&nbsp;... at the end of the 25 year period the agents, seeing the tremendous advantage to themselves in keeping the Indians ignorant and in some cases swindled them in their business operations, brought influence to bear to have the time extended on the treaty&nbsp;...'Conditions on the reservation are no better today than they were in 1855' the speaker said. 'The education obtainable is only equivalent to a fifth-grade education. If further schooling is desired and can be paid for the young Indian is permitted to go to another school to ensure an education equivalent to that of the eight grade'&nbsp;... 'More than that' he said, 'the mind of the young Indian is often poisoned against his own people by the conviction that the whites regard him as inferior. He thus loses his chance for success in both races, for he is afraid to mingle with the whites on an equal footing and he is ashamed of his own people. He becomes a renegade, an outlaw, or at best a shiftless drifter without ambition to overcome the odds against him&nbsp;... [he calls for the end of educational system enforced on them and then outlines the patriotism of Indian service in WWI for the United States, he continues] This is the only country on earth for them&nbsp;... and if they are willing to shed their blood for it, they should be good enough to share equally in the advantages that are given to every other race within our borders.'<ref name=BT1926/><ref>for related information see {{cite book|author1=Clifford E.

In a 1927 talk to a church group Strongheart "&nbsp;...&nbsp;made an eloquent appeal that the Indian now be given the same chance in life as the white man, in education, in freedom, and in opportunity&nbsp;... He&nbsp;... [had] not difficulty in expressing the most minute shades of meaning. Incidentally he had a fund of humor which caught his hearers by surprise from time to time, and occasionally he found opportunity for a little satire and sarcasm at some of the Caucasian follies."<ref name=PDT1927/>

In 1928 he more than once urged support of a bill "that would aid the 200 Alabama Coushatta people living in a swamp near Livingston, TX. This tribe came at the request of General Sam Houston to aid in the fight for Texas Independence in 1836,"<ref>{{cite web

{{quote|The young Indian is taught the lesson of life through the careful training of his parents, the mother devoting her entire time to her children and the father teaching his son to hunt and fish, taking him with him as a companion. They are taught self reliance at an early age, and they are taught to respect women above all things, and protect them ever against himself. The children of the Indian family bear the name of the mother, rather than the father, which is explained in that they are born of the mother's flesh and blood and not the father's. From time to time they receive a different name, and their names signify their outstanding characteristics or accomplishments.

Before an Indian is permitted to consider marriage with a young girl he must have attained three feathers, each with a meaning, one for patience, courage and bravery, and two additional ones for honor must be added before he may be married. In this way the Indian protects his women from marrying unworthy men and there is no cause for divorce in his government&nbsp;... (of the Indian Citizen Bill that passed he says it) failed to accomplish its purpose&nbsp;... but which resulted in the Congress of the United States passing a resolution to investigate the entire system of the Indian office and its agencies. It is the hope that the Senate investigation committee will during this summer visit the isolated settlement of the Alabama and Coushata Indians, who are now living in a most pitiful state of existence, and observe the suffering these people have to ensure that no white man would ever tolerate under any circumstances&nbsp;...

He points out that&nbsp;... an education above the fifth grade must have the sanction of the government agent of the reservation&nbsp;... the younger ones, who have had schooling, should be enable to learn by responsibility. They might make some mistakes, but they would learn by them, and make better citizens than they have under 95 years of paternalism&nbsp;... the Bureau of Indian Affairs still claims that the Indians are incompetent; does this not speak very poorly of the paternalism of that monstrous organization&nbsp;...?<ref name=VDR1928/>}}

====Advocacy through Hollywood====
Strongheart practised his activism broadly across his career, addressing [[stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America]] and [[racism in early American film]].
According to Michelle H. Raheja, "Strongheart played primarily uncredited minor roles in films; however, his work off-screen is critical to understanding how Native American actors operated within a visual sovereignty paradigm.&nbsp;... Strongheart&nbsp;... used his position as an actor to propel his activism. He hosted Native American students from [[Sherman Indian High School|Sherman Institute]]&nbsp;...".<ref name="Raheja2011"/> Scholar Joanna Hearne wrote, "Throughout his career in Hollywood, he worked as a translator, language coach, and casting agent for Westerns when directors sought to include realistic elements in their films&nbsp;... in some cases he was able to use this position to agitate for changes, even suggesting the additions of specific characters".<ref name=Hearne2013/>

The first specific case mentioned by scholars was his involvement in the 1925 remake of ''Braveheart'', where he was able to include Indians who were not dressed in regalia and succeeded in redressing wrongs done to them; the lead role, however, was still played by a white man in Indian costume.<ref name="Strongheart1954"/><ref name=Muntz2006/>{{rp|p60}}<ref name=Ewen/><ref name=Conklin2008/> Hearne said of the film, "The court sequence is heavily and multiply textualized&nbsp;... conveying legal arguments and judgements that refer to treaties&nbsp;... the judge's decision parses the meaning of the treaty text itself: 'We have examined the Federal treaty with the Indians and find that it gives them the right to fish where and when they please, without limitation by State tax or private ownership.'"<ref name=Hearne2013/> A second specific case came late in Strongheart's career, on ''Pony Soldier'', for which he wrote a critical review of the proposed screenplay, even though other departments of the studio had begun work on it. This led to a meeting with studio executives, resulting in major changes to the project.<ref name="Strongheart1954"/><ref name=Hearne2013/>

====Advocacy through associations====
Visiting reservations gave Strongheart a chance to learn from different nations and let him report to the Society of American Indians on the conditions in reservations, which he was doing actively by 1921.<ref name="Fisher-at-Oregon"/> Through the Society he reported on investigations of land grabs against [[Paiutes]] and advocated for the unrecognized tribes of the Calusa and Pitt River peoples.<ref name="Fisher-at-Oregon"/>

Early in his transition to working in Los Angeles, Strongheart co-founded the Los Angeles Indian Center<ref name="Fisher-at-Oregon"/> in 1936.<ref name="Raheja2011"/><ref name=founded/> Joan Weibel-Orlando, quoting Bramstedt (1977:93) said, "the Los Angeles Indian Center was "the most widely known Indian institution in Los Angeles and 'played an integral role in the formation of service organizations. In fact, if the history of [Los Angeles] Indian groups had any common thread, it was produced by this organization'"<ref name=founded/>

Still early in his transition to Hollywood Strongheart also aided directly in the founding of the [[National Congress of American Indians]] in 1944, in response to termination and assimilation policies that the [[U.S. government]] forced upon the tribal governments in contravention of their treaty rights and status as sovereign entities.<ref name="Fisher-at-Oregon"/> The organization continues to be an association of federally recognized and state recognized American Indian tribes.
