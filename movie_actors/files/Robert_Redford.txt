He has received two [[Academy Award]]s: one in 1981 for [[Academy Award for Best Director|directing]] ''[[Ordinary People]]'', and one for [[Academy Honorary Award|Lifetime Achievement]] in 2002. In 2010, he was made a [[Legion_of_Honour#Classes_and_insignia| chevalier]] of the ''[[Légion d'Honneur]]''.

Redford's career began in New York. He started his acting career in 1959 as a guest star on numerous TV programs, including ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'',  and ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', among others. He earned an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in ''The Voice of Charlie Pont'' (ABC, 1962). Redford's biggest Broadway success was as the stuffy [[newlywed]] husband of [[Elizabeth Ashley]] in [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Barefoot in the Park]]'' (1963). Redford made his film debut in ''[[War Hunt]]'' (1962). ''[[Inside Daisy Clover]]'' (1965) won him a [[Golden Globe]] for best new star. He starred in [[George Roy Hill]]'s ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969), which was a huge success and made him a major star. In 1972, he had a critical and box office hit with ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]'' (1972); and in 1973 the biggest hit of his career, the blockbuster crime caper ''[[The Sting]]'', for which he was also nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]]. The popular and acclaimed ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1976), was a landmark film for Redford.

The first film he directed, ''[[Ordinary People]]'' (1980), was one of the most critically and publicly acclaimed films of the decade, winning a number of Oscars. Redford starred in [[Sydney Pollack]]'s ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985), which was an enormous critical and box office success and won seven [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] including Best Picture, proving to be Redford's biggest success of the decade. He released his third film as a director, ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'', in 1992. In April 2014, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine included Redford in its annual [[TIME 100|''TIME'' 100]] as one of the "Most Influential People in the World" declaring him the "Godfather of Indie Film."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/75192/the-ties-that-bind-the-time-100/|title=Editor's Letter: The Ties That Bind the TIME 100|author=Nancy Gibbs|work=TIME.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/70828/robert-redford-2014-time-100/|title=Robert Redford|work=TIME.com}}</ref>

== Career ==
=== Television ===
Redford's career—like that of almost all major stars who emerged in the 1950s—began in New York, where an actor could find work both in television and on stage. Starting in 1959, he appeared as a guest star on numerous programs, including ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[The Americans (1961 TV series)|The Americans]]'', ''[[Whispering Smith (TV series)|Whispering Smith]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'', ''[[Dr. Kildare#Television|Dr. Kildare]]'', ''[[Playhouse 90]]'', ''[[Tate (TV series)|Tate]]'',  ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', and "[[Captain Brassbound's Conversion]]" with a young Christopher Plummer, among others.

In 1960, Redford was cast as Danny Tilford, a mentally disturbed young man trapped in the wreckage of his family garage, in "Breakdown", one of the last episodes of the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] adventure series, ''[[Rescue 8]]'', starring [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]] and [[Lang Jeffries]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074035/|title="Breakdown" on ''Rescue 8'', March 31, 1960|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref>

Redford earned an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]] nomination as Best Supporting Actor for his performance in ''[[The Voice of Charlie Pont]]'' (ABC, 1962). One of his last television appearances was on October 7, 1963, on ''[[Breaking Point (1963 TV series)|Breaking Point]],'' an ABC medical drama about [[psychiatry]].

=== Theater ===
Redford's Broadway debut was in a small role in ''Tall Story'' (1959), followed by parts in ''The Highest Tree'' (1959) and ''Sunday in New York'' (1961). His biggest Broadway success was as the stuffy [[newlywed]] husband of [[Elizabeth Ashley]] in [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Barefoot in the Park]]'' (1963).<ref>This information is available on the IMD website.</ref>

=== Film ===
[[File:Robert Redford Barefoot in the park.jpg|thumb|Redford in ''[[Barefoot in the Park (film)|Barefoot in the Park]]'', 1967]]
While still largely an unknown, Redford made his screen debut in ''[[Tall Story]]'' (1960). It was a minor role. Stars were [[Anthony Perkins]], [[Jane Fonda]], and [[Ray Walston]]. This film also marked the debut of [[Jane Fonda]]. The movie was about a college basketball star, [[Anthony Perkins]], who gets himself into trouble debating as to whether or not he should accept<ref>IMD website</ref> a bribe to throw a basketball game against a team from Russia. After his Broadway success, he was cast in larger feature roles in movies. In 1962 Robert Redford got his second film role in a movie named [[War Hunt]]. He was cast alongside screen legend [[Alec Guinness]] in the war comedy ''[[Situation Hopeless ... But Not Serious]]'', in which he played a soldier who has to spend years of his life hiding behind enemy lines. In ''[[Inside Daisy Clover]]'' (1965), which won him a [[Golden Globe]] for best new star, he played a [[bisexual]] movie star who marries starlet [[Natalie Wood]], and rejoined her along with [[Charles Bronson]] for Pollack's ''[[This Property Is Condemned]]'' (1966)—again as her lover, though this time in a film which achieved even greater success. The same year saw his first teaming with [[Jane Fonda]], in [[Arthur Penn]]'s ''[[The Chase (1966 film)|The Chase]]''. This film marked the only time Redford would star with [[Marlon Brando]]. Fonda and Redford were paired again in the popular big screen version of ''[[Barefoot in the Park (film)|Barefoot in the Park]]'' (1967)<ref name=tca/> and were again co-stars much later in Pollack's ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'' (1979).

After this initial success, Redford became concerned about his [[blond]] male stereotype image{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} and turned down roles in ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' and ''[[The Graduate]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  Redford found the property he was looking for in [[George Roy Hill]]'s ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969), scripted by [[William Goldman]], in which he was paired for the first time with [[Paul Newman]].<ref name=tca/> The film was a huge success and made him a major bankable star,<ref name=tca/> cementing his screen image as an intelligent, reliable, sometimes sardonic good guy.

Redford suffered through a few films that did not achieve box office success during this time, including ''[[Downhill Racer]]'' (1969); ''[[Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here]]'' (1969); ''[[Little Fauss and Big Halsy]]'' (1970), and ''[[The Hot Rock (film)|The Hot Rock]]'' (1972). But his overall career was flourishing with the critical and box office hit ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]'' (1972);<ref name=tca/> the political satire ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972); the hugely popular period drama ''[[The Way We Were]]'' (1973); and the biggest hit of his career; the blockbuster crime caper ''[[The Sting]]'' (1973), which became one of the top 20 highest grossing movies of all time when adjusted for inflation and for which he was also nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]].<ref name=tca/>

Between 1974 and 1976, exhibitors voted Redford Hollywood's top box-office name.<ref name=tca/>  His hits included ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'' (1974), ''[[The Great Waldo Pepper]]'' (1975), and ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'' (1975). The popular and acclaimed ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1976), directed by [[Alan J. Pakula]] and scripted once again by Goldman, was a landmark film for Redford. Not only was he the executive producer and co-star, but the film's serious subject matter—the [[Watergate scandal]]—and its attempt to create a realistic portrayal of journalism, also reflected the actor's offscreen concerns for political causes.<ref name=tca/>

He also appeared in a segment of the war film ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (1977) before starring in the prison drama ''[[Brubaker]]'' (1980), playing a prison warden attempting to reform the system, and the baseball drama ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984).<ref name=tca/> Redford continued his involvement in mainstream Hollywood movies, though with a newfound focus on directing. The first film he directed, ''[[Ordinary People]]'', which followed the disintegration of an upper-class American family after the death of a son, was one of the most critically and publicly acclaimed films of the decade, winning a number of Oscars, including the Academy Award for best Director for Redford himself, and Best Picture. His follow-up directorial project, ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' (1987), failed to generate the same level of attention. Sydney Pollack's ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985), with Redford in the male lead role opposite [[Meryl Streep]], became an enormous critical and box office success and won seven [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] including Best Picture, proving to be Redford's biggest success of the decade and Redford and Pollack's most successful of their six movies together.<ref name=tca/> His next film, ''[[Legal Eagles]]'' (1986), was only a minor success at the box office.

Redford continued as a major star throughout the 1990s and 2000s. He released his third film as a director, ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'', in 1992, which was a return to mainstream success for Redford as a director and brought a young [[Brad Pitt]] to greater prominence. In 1993, Redford played what became one of his most popular and recognized roles, starring in ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'' as a millionaire businessman who tests a couple's morals; the film became one of the year's biggest hits. He co-starred with [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in the newsroom romance ''[[Up Close & Personal]]'' (1996), and with [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] in ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'' (1998), which he also directed.<ref name=tca/> Redford also continued work in films with political context, such as ''[[Havana (film)|Havana]]'' (1990), playing Jack Weil, a professional gambler in 1959 Cuba during the Revolution, as well as ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' (1992), in which he co starred with [[River Phoenix]] among others.

He appeared as a disgraced Army general sent to prison in the prison drama ''[[The Last Castle]]'' (2001), directed by Rod Lurie. In the same year, Redford reteamed with [[Brad Pitt]] for ''[[Spy Game]]'', another success for the pair but with Redford switching this time from director to actor. Redford, a leading environmental activist, narrated the IMAX documentary ''[[Sacred Planet]]'' (2004), a sweeping journey across the globe to some of its most exotic and endangered places. In ''[[The Clearing]]'' (2004), a thriller co-starring Helen Mirren, Redford was a successful businessman whose kidnapping unearths the secrets and inadequacies that led to his achieving the American Dream.

Redford stepped back into producing with ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'' (2004), a coming-of-age road film about a young medical student, Ernesto "Che" Guevera, and his friend Alberto Granado.  It also explored political and social issues of South America that influenced Guevara and shaped his future.  With five years spent on the film's making, Redford was credited by director Walter Salles for being instrumental in getting it made and released.

Back in front of the camera, Redford received good notices for his role in director Lasse Hallstrom's ''[[An Unfinished Life]]'' (2005) as a cantankerous rancher who is forced to take in his estranged daughter-in-law (Jennifer Lopez)—whom he blames for his son's death—and the granddaughter he never knew he had when they fled an abusive relationship.  The film, which sat on the shelf for many months while its distributor Miramax was restructured, was generally dismissed as clichéd and overly sentimental. Meanwhile, Redford returned to familiar territory when he reteamed with [[Meryl Streep]] 22 years after they starred in ''Out of Africa'', for his personal project ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'' (2007), which also starred fellow superstar [[Tom Cruise]]. After a great deal of hype, the film opened to mixed reviews and disappointing box office. Redford more recently signed on to direct and star in an update of ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Redford appeared in the 2011 documentary ''[[Buck (film)|Buck]]'', where he discussed his experiences with title subject [[Buck Brannaman]] during the production of ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]''.  In 2012, Redford directed and starred in ''[[The Company You Keep (film)|The Company You Keep]]'', about a former Weather Underground activist who goes on the run from a journalist who has discovered his identity.  In 2013, he starred in ''[[All Is Lost]]'', directed by J.C. Chandor, about a man lost at sea. He received very high acclaim for his performance in the film, in which he is its only cast member and has almost no dialogue.  In April 2014, Redford appeared in the [[Marvel Studios]] super hero film ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' playing [[Alexander Pierce]], the main antagonist who is the head of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and leader of the [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] cell operating the Triskelion.<ref>{{cite web|author=April 3, 2013 |url=http://news.yahoo.com/robert-redford-confirms-captain-america-winter-soldier-role-153202834.html |title=Robert Redford Confirms Captain America: The Winter Soldier Role - Yahoo!

== Director ==
[[File:Redford Milagro Cannes 1988.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Redford with [[Melanie Griffith]] and [[Sônia Braga]], promoting ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' at the [[1988 Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Redford had long harbored ambitions to work on both sides of the camera.  As early as 1969, Redford had served as the executive producer for ''[[Downhill Racer]]''.<ref name=tca/> His first outing as director was 1980's Best Picture winner ''[[Ordinary People]]'', a drama about the slow disintegration of an [[upper-middle class]] family, for which he won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].<ref name=tca/> Redford was credited with obtaining a powerful dramatic performance from [[Mary Tyler Moore]], as well as superb work from [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Timothy Hutton]], who also won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].

Redford did not direct again until ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' (1988), a well-crafted, though not commercially successful, screen version of [[John Nichols (American writer)|John Nichols]]' acclaimed novel of the Southwest. ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' is the story of the people of Milagro, New Mexico (based on the real town of [[Truchas, New Mexico|Truchas]] in northern New Mexico), overcoming big developers who set about to ruin their community and force them out because of tax increases.  Other directorial projects have included the period drama ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'' (1992), based on [[Norman Maclean]]'s novella, and the exposé ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' (1994), about the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s.<ref name=tca/> In the latter film, Redford worked from a screenplay by [[Paul Attanasio]] with noted cinematographer [[Michael Ballhaus]] and a strong cast that featured [[Paul Scofield]], [[John Turturro]], [[Rob Morrow]], and [[Ralph Fiennes]]. Redford handpicked Morrow for his part in the film (Morrow's only high-profile feature film role to date), because he liked his work on ''[[Northern Exposure]]''.  Redford also directed [[Matt Damon]] and [[Will Smith]] in ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' (2000). In 2010, Redford released ''[[The Conspirator]]'', a period drama revolving around the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Despite a subject matter of personal interest to Redford, the film received mixed reviews and proved to be a flop at the box office.

== Sundance ==
With the financial proceeds of his acting success, starting with his salaries from ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' and ''Downhill Racer'', Redford bought an entire [[ski area]] on the east side of [[Mount Timpanogos]] northeast of [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], Utah, called "Timp Haven", which was renamed "[[Sundance Resort|Sundance]]".<ref name=tca/> Redford's wife Lola was from Utah and they had built a home in the area in 1963. Portions of the movie ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]'' (1972), a film which is both one of Redford's favorites and one that has heavily influenced him, were shot near the ski area. He founded the [[Sundance Institute]], [[Sundance Cinemas]], Sundance Catalog, and the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]], all in and around [[Park City, Utah|Park City]], Utah, 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) north of the Sundance ski area.<ref name=tca/>  The Sundance Film Festival caters to independent filmmakers in the United States and has received recognition from the industry as a place to open films.
