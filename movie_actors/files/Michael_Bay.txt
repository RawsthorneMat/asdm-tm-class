Despite his considerable success at the international box office, Bay has received mixed to negative reviews for his work from film critics. While his films such as ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'', ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'', ''[[Pain & Gain]]'', and ''Transformers'' received mildly positive reviews by critics and audiences, his three sequels in the ''Transformers'' film series were panned by critics, as were ''Pearl Harbor'', the ''Bad Boys'' films, and ''Armageddon''.

==Early life==
Michael Bay was born in Los Angeles, California. He was raised by his adoptive parents Harriet, a bookstore owner/[[child psychiatrist]], and Jim, a [[Certified Public Accountant]] (CPA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/28/Michael-Bay.html|title=Michael Bay Biography (1965–)|work=[http://www.filmreference.com FilmReference.com]|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=2010-07-03}}</ref> He was raised [[American Jews|Jewish]].<ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Michael_Bay.html Michael Bay] [[Jewish Virtual Library]] - retrieved July 23, 2013</ref> His grandfather was from [[Russia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.orange.co.uk/article/news/linkin_park_rock_russian_transformers_premiere|title=Linkin Park Rocks Russian Transformers Premiere|work=[http://web.orange.co.uk/p/news/home Orange News]|date=2011-06-24|accessdate=2011-07-13}}</ref> His cousin, [[Susan Bay]], is the widow of the late ''[[Star Trek]]'' actor [[Leonard Nimoy]] (whom he eventually cast as the voice actor for Sentinel Prime in ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/04/21/michael-bay-afraid-to-offend-leonard-nimoy-with-transformers-family-reunion-offer/|title=Michael Bay Afraid to Offend Leonard Nimoy With Transformers Family Reunion Offer|last=Carroll|first=Larry|work=[http://moviesblog.mtv.com MoviesBlog.MTV.com]|publisher=MTV|date=2009-04-21|accessdate=2010-07-03}}</ref> He attended the exclusive [[Crossroads School (Santa Monica)|Crossroads School]], in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/24/entertainment/ca-transformers24|title=Michael Bay, master of the 'huge canvas'|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Sam Zell]]|date=2009-05-24|accessdate=2010-07-03}}</ref> Bay often traces his interest in action films back to an incident during his childhood. As a boy, he attached some firecrackers to a toy train and filmed the ensuing fiery disaster with his mother's [[8 mm film|8 millimeter]] camera. The fire department was called and he was grounded.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-06-18-transformers-main_N.htm|title='Transformers' blasts back: Another Michael Bay direct hit|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|work=[http://www.usatoday.com USA Today]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=2009-06-18|accessdate=2010-07-03}}</ref>

==Career==
Bay got his start in the film industry interning with [[George Lucas]] when he was fifteen, filing the [[storyboards]] for ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', which he thought was going to be terrible. His opinion changed after seeing it in the theater and he was so impressed by the experience that he decided to become a film director.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20044598,00.html|last=Vary|first=Adam B.|title=Optimus Prime Time|work=[http://www.ew.com EW.com]|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2010-06-30|accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref> He graduated from [[Wesleyan University]] in 1986, majoring in both English and Film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.michaelbay.com/bio/bio.html|title=Biography|last=Lauren|first=Nelson|work=[https://www.michaelbay.com Michael Bay Dot Com – Official Site]|accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/0622/celebrity-09-transformers-michael-bay-making-movies-enemies-money.html|title=Michael Bay: Making Movies, Enemies and Money|page=2|last=Pomerantz|first=Dorothy|work=[http://www.forbes.com Forbes.com]|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=2009-06-22|accessdate=2010-07-03}}</ref> He was a member of the [[Psi Upsilon]] fraternity and a favorite student of film historian [[Jeanine Basinger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/48-armageddon|title=Armageddon|last=Basinger|first=Jeanine|work=[http://www.criterion.com Criterion.com]|publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]]|date=1999-06-21|accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref> For his graduate work, he attended [[Art Center College of Design]] in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] where he also studied film.<ref name="educate">{{cite web|title=Michael Bay- Biography|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/person/michael-bay/biography.html|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Michael Bay began working at [[Propaganda Films]], directing commercials and music videos, two weeks after finishing his post-graduate degree.<ref name="educate"/> His 90-second World War II-inspired [[Coca-Cola]] advertisement was picked up by [[Capitol Records]]. His first national commercial for the [[Red Cross]] won a [[Clio Awards|Clio Award]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283851,00.html|title=Is Michael Bay the Devil?|last=Hochman|first=David|work=[http://www.ew.com EW.com]|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1998-07-10|accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amctv.com/originals/shootout/smso_guests/biopage_bay|title=Shootout – Michael Bay|work=[http://www.amctv.com AMC TV]|accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref> He directed [[Goodby, Silverstein & Partners]] Got Milk? advertisement campaign for the California Milk Processors Board in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2009/aaron-burr-got-milk/|title=Got Milk?

Bay's success in music videos gained the attention of producers [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Don Simpson]], who selected him to direct his first feature-length film, ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]''. The film was shot in [[Miami]] in 1994 and starred [[Will Smith]] and [[Martin Lawrence]]. The action film proved to be a break-out role for Smith, who was segueing from television to films at that time. Shooting in Miami was a good experience for Bay who would later own a home in the city and spend a great deal of time there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hauteliving.com/2008/09/behind-the-camera-%60/|title=Behind the Camera|last=Wilson|first=Stephanie|work=[http://www.hauteliving.com/ Haute Living]|publisher=Seth Semilof|date=2008-09-05|accessdate=2010-07-05}}</ref> The film was completed for $19 million and grossed a remarkable $141 million at the box office in the summer of 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=17446|title=Martin Lawrence Says ''Bad Boys'' 3 is Real|work=[http://www.worstpreviews.com Worst Previews.com]|date=2010-04-21|accessdate=2010-07-05}}</ref> Bay's success led to a strong partnership and friendship with [[Jerry Bruckheimer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com/2008/02/jerry-bruckheimer-hollywood-interview.html|title=Jerry Bruckheimer: The Hollywood Interview|last=Simon|first=Alex|work=reprinted by [http://www.thehollywoodinterview.blogspot.com The Hollywood Interview.com] (originally published by [http://www.venicemag.com Venice Magazine])|publisher=Nancy Martinez|date=2008-2-28 [orig.

His follow-up film, ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' (1996), was an action movie set on [[Alcatraz Island]], and in the [[San Francisco Bay area]]. It starred [[Sean Connery]], [[Nicolas Cage]] and [[Ed Harris]]. It was also produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Don Simpson]], the latter of whom died five months before the film's release. The film is dedicated to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,291215,00.html|title=Death of a Hollywood Bad Boy|last=Ascher-Walsh|first=Rebecca|work=[http://www.ew.com EW.com]|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1996-02-06|accessdate=2010-07-06}}</ref> Connery and Cage won 'Best On-Screen Duo' at the [[MTV Movie Awards]] in 1997 and the film was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Achievement in Sound category for the work of Greg P.

In 1998, Bay collaborated with [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] again, this time as a co-producer, as well as directing the action-adventure film ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdreview.com/html/dvd_review_-_michael_bay_interview.shtml|title=DVD Review – Midas Touch of Destruction|last=Henckel|first=Guido|work=[http://www.dvdreview.com DVD Review]|date=1999-2|accessdate=2010-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_22/b3885110.htm|title=Jerry Bruckheimer: Hollywood's Most Wanted |last=Grover|first=Ronald|work=[http://www.businessweek.com Businessweek – BW Online]|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|date=2004-05-31|accessdate=2010-07-09}}</ref> The film, about a group of tough oil drillers who are sent by [[NASA]] to deflect an [[asteroid]] away from a [[collision course]] with [[Earth]], starred [[Bruce Willis]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Liv Tyler]].

In 2001, Bay directed ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]''. It starred [[Ben Affleck]], [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Kate Beckinsale]] and [[Cuba Gooding, Jr.]] The film was released on [[Memorial Day]] weekend in 2001. Again, Bay produced the film with Jerry Bruckheimer. The film received four Academy Award nominations, including Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Editing and Best Song. Again, Kevin O'Connell received another nomination for Best Sound, but he did not win. ''Pearl Harbor'' won in the category for Sound Editing, making it Bay's first (and, to date, only) film to win an Oscar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/oscarlegacy/2000-2009/74nominees.html|title=Nominees and Winners for the 74th Annual Academy Awards|work=[http://www.oscars.org The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]|date=2002-05-24|accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref> Michael Bay also directed the music video for nominated track "There You'll Be" by vocal artist [[Faith Hill]].<ref name="educate"/>

Bay reteamed with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence for ''[[Bad Boys II]]'', a sequel which also marked Bay's fifth collaboration with [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]. The film grossed $138 million domestically, enough to cover the production budget, and $273 million worldwide, almost twice as much as the first movie.
In 2005, Bay directed ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'', a science-fiction film starring [[Ewan McGregor]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. It was the first film Michael Bay made without Jerry Bruckheimer. ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' cost $126 million to produce. It earned $46 million domestically and $172 million worldwide. Bay stated that he was not comfortable with the domestic marketing campaign as it confused the audience as to the true subject of the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jul/17/entertainment/ca-michaelbay17|title=You Call This Paradise?|last=Horn|first=John|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=2005-07-17|accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref>

In 2007, he directed and teamed up with [[Steven Spielberg]] to produce ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', a live action film based on the [[Transformers|''Transformers'' franchise]]. The film was released in the U.S. and Canada on July 3, 2007, with 8 p.m. preview screenings on July 2. The previews earned $8.8 million, and in its first day of general release it grossed $27.8 million, a record for Tuesday box office attendance.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} It broke the record held by ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' for the biggest July 4 gross, making $29 million.

Bay returned as director and executive producer for ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'', which was released on June 24, 2009 and went on to gross over $832 million worldwide.

==Criticism==
Despite his box office success, Bay has found little critical praise. The 2004 puppet film ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' directed by [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]] (creators of ''[[South Park]]'') features a song titled "The End of an Act", which bashes Bay and ''Pearl Harbor''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://michaelbay.com/articles/the-mere-mention-of-his-name-is-enough-to-make-movie-critics-hiss-and-groan/ |title=The Mere Mention of His Name Is Enough to Make Movie Critics Hiss and Groan |author=Rodriguez, Rene |publisher=MichaelBay.com |accessdate=2014-06-21}}</ref> In response to the criticism, Bay has said: "I make movies for teenage boys. Oh, dear, what a crime."<ref>Curtis, Bryan (2005-06-15).
