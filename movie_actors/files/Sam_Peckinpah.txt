'''David Samuel "Sam" Peckinpah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|k|ɪ|n|ˌ|p|ɑː}};<ref>"Peckinpah", ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''</ref> February 21, 1925 – December 28, 1984) was an American film director and screenwriter who achieved prominence following the release of the [[Western (genre)|Western]] epic ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). He was known for the innovative and explicit depiction of action and violence as well as his [[Revisionist Western|revisionist]] approach to the Western genre.

Peckinpah's films generally deal with the conflict between values and ideals, and the corruption of violence in human society. He was given the nickname "Bloody Sam" owing to the violence in his films.  His characters are often loners or losers who desire to be honorable, but are forced to compromise in order to survive in a world of [[nihilism]] and brutality.

Peckinpah's combative personality, marked by years of alcohol and drug abuse, affected his professional legacy. Many of his films were noted for behind-the-scenes battles with producers and crew members, damaging his reputation and career during his lifetime.  Some of his films, including ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971), ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973) and ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'' (1974), remain controversial.

==Family origins==
The Peckinpahs originated from the [[Frisian Islands]] in the northwest of Europe. Both sides of Peckinpah's family migrated to the American West by [[covered wagon]] in the mid-19th century.{{sfn|Current Biography|1973|p=327}} Peckinpah and several relatives often claimed Native American ancestry, but this has been denied by surviving family members.{{sfn|Simmons|p=3}} Peckinpah's great-grandfather, Rice Peckinpaugh, a merchant and farmer in [[Indiana]], moved to [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]] California in the 1850s, working in the logging business, and changed the spelling of the family name to "Peckinpah."{{sfn|Weddle|p=15}}{{sfn|Fine|p=12}} Peckinpah Meadow and Peckinpah Creek, where the family ran a lumber mill on a mountain in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|High Sierra]] north of [[Coarsegold, California]], have been officially named on U.S. geographical maps.{{sfn|Simmons|p=3}} Peckinpah's maternal grandfather was [[Denver S. Church]], a cattle rancher, Superior Court judge and [[United States Congressman]] of a California district including [[Fresno County]].{{sfn|Weddle|p=16}} Sam Peckinpah's nephew is [[David Peckinpah]], who was a television producer and director, as well as a screenplay writer.{{sfn|David E. Peckinpah|IMDB}}  Peckinpah's parents were David Edward Peckinpah and Fern Louise Church, and he is a cousin of former [[New York Yankees]] shortstop [[Roger Peckinpaugh]].{{sfn|Simmons|p=5}}

==Life==
David Samuel "Sam" Peckinpah was born February 21, 1925, in [[Fresno, California]], where he attended both grammar school and high school.{{sfn|FilmReference}} He spent much time skipping classes with his brother to engage in [[cowboy]] activities on their grandfather [[Denver S. Church|Denver Church]]'s ranch, including trapping, branding, and shooting. During the 1930s and 1940s, [[Coarsegold]] and [[Bass Lake, California|Bass Lake]] were still populated with descendants of the miners and ranchers of the 19th century. Many of these descendants worked on Church's ranch. At that time, it was a rural area undergoing extreme change, and this exposure is believed to have affected Peckinpah's [[Western (genre)|Western]] films later in life.{{sfn|Simmons|pp=10–11}}

He played on the junior varsity football team while at Fresno High School, but frequent fighting and discipline problems caused his parents to enroll him in the San Rafael Military Academy for his senior year.{{sfn|Simmons|p=18}} In 1943, he joined the [[United States Marine Corps]]. Within two years, his battalion was sent to China with the task of disarming Japanese soldiers and [[repatriation|repatriating]] them following World War II. While his duty did not include combat, he claims to have witnessed acts of war between Chinese and Japanese soldiers. According to friends, these included several acts of torture and the murder of a laborer by sniper fire. The American Marines were not permitted to intervene. Peckinpah also claimed he was shot during an attack by Communist forces. Also during his final weeks as a Marine, he applied for discharge in [[Peking]], so he could marry a local woman, but was refused. His experiences in China reportedly deeply affected Peckinpah, and may have influenced his depictions of violence in his films.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=52–59}}

After being discharged in Los Angeles, he attended [[California State University, Fresno]], where he studied history. While a student, he met and married his first wife, Marie Selland, in 1947. A drama major, Selland introduced Peckinpah to the theater department and he became interested in directing for the first time. During his senior year, he adapted and directed a one-hour version of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]''. After graduation in 1948, Peckinpah enrolled in graduate studies in drama at [[University of Southern California]]. He spent two seasons as the director in residence at Huntington Park Civic Theatre near Los Angeles before obtaining his master's degree. He was asked to stay
another year, but Peckinpah began working as a [[stagehand]] at KLAC-TV in the belief that television experience would eventually lead to work in films. Even during this early stage of his career, Peckinpah was developing a combative streak. Reportedly, he was kicked off the set of ''[[Liberace|The Liberace Show]]'' for not wearing a tie, and he refused to cue a car salesman during a live feed because of his attitude towards stagehands.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=104–105}}

In 1954, Peckinpah was hired as a [[dialogue coach]] for the film ''[[Riot in Cell Block 11]]''. His job entailed acting as an assistant for the movie's director, [[Don Siegel]]. The film was shot on location at [[Folsom Prison]]. Reportedly, the warden was reluctant to allow the filmmakers to work at the prison until he was introduced to Peckinpah. The warden knew his family from Fresno and was immediately cooperative. Siegel's location work and his use of actual prisoners as extras in the film made a lasting impression on Peckinpah. He worked as a dialogue coach on four additional Siegel films: ''[[Private Hell 36]]'' (1954), ''[[An Annapolis Story]]'', (1955, and co-starring [[L. Q. Jones]]), ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1956) and ''[[Crime in the Streets]]'' (1956).{{sfn|Weddle|pp=116–119}} ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'', in which Peckinpah appeared in a cameo as Charlie the meter reader, starred [[Kevin McCarthy (actor)|Kevin McCarthy]] and [[Dana Wynter]]. It became one of the most critically praised [[History of science fiction films|science fiction]] films of the 1950s. Peckinpah claimed to have done an extensive rewrite on the film's screenplay, a statement which remains controversial.{{sfn|Weddle|p=120}} Nevertheless, Peckinpah's association with Siegel established him as an emerging screenwriter and potential director.

Throughout much of his adult life, Peckinpah was affected by alcoholism, and, later, other forms of drug addiction. According to some accounts, he also suffered from mental illness, possibly [[manic depression]] or [[paranoia]].{{sfn|Weddle|pp=499–500}} It is believed his drinking problems began during his service in the military while stationed in China, when he would frequent the saloons of [[Tianjin]] and Beijing.{{sfn|Weddle|p=56}} After divorcing Selland, the mother of his first four children, in 1960, he married the Mexican actress Begoña Palacios in 1965. A stormy relationship developed, and over the years they married on three separate occasions. They had one daughter together.{{sfn|Simmons|pp=63–64}} His personality reportedly often swung between a sweet, soft-spoken, artistic disposition, and bouts of rage and violence during which he verbally and physically abused himself and others. An experienced hunter, Peckinpah was fascinated with firearms and was known to shoot the mirrors in his house while abusing alcohol, an image which occurs several times in his films.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=163,479}} Peckinpah's reputation as a hard-living brute with a taste for violence, inspired by the content in his most popular films and in many ways perpetuated by himself, affected his artistic legacy.{{sfn|Weddle|p=380}} His friends and family have claimed this does a disservice to a man who was actually more complex than generally credited. Throughout his career, Peckinpah seems to have inspired extraordinary loyalty in certain friends and employees. He used the same actors ([[Warren Oates]], [[L. Q. Jones]], [[R. G. Armstrong]], [[James Coburn]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]]), and collaborators ([[Jerry Fielding]], [[Lucien Ballard]], Gordon Dawson, and Martin Baum) in many of his films, and several of his friends and assistants stuck by him to the end of his life.

Peckinpah spent a great deal of his life in [[Mexico]] after his marriage to Palacios, eventually buying property in the country. He was reportedly fascinated by the Mexican lifestyle and culture, and he often portrayed it with an unusual sentimentality and romanticism in his films. Four of his films, ''[[Major Dundee]]'' (1965), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973) and ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'' (1974), were filmed entirely on location within Mexico, while ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]'' (1972) concludes with a couple escaping to freedom there.{{sfn|Sam Peckinpah|IMDB}}

==Death==
Peckinpah was seriously ill during his final years, as a lifetime of hard living caught up with him. Regardless, he continued to work until his last months. He died of heart failure on December 28, 1984.{{sfn|Weddle|p=550}} At the time, he was in preparation for shooting an original script by [[Stephen King]] entitled ''The Shotgunners'', which later became a book called ''[[The Regulators]]''.{{sfn|Biography: Sam Peckinpah|IMDB}} He lived at [[The Murray Hotel]] in [[Livingston, Montana]] from 1979 until his death in 1984.{{sfn|Cohen|pp=77–80}}

==Television career==
On the recommendation of [[Don Siegel]], Peckinpah established himself during the late 1950s as a scriptwriter of [[Television Westerns|western]] series of the era, selling scripts to ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'', ''[[The Rifleman]]'', ''[[Broken Arrow (TV series)|Broken Arrow]]'', ''Klondike'', and ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre]]''.{{sfn|Sam Peckinpah|IMDB}}{{sfn|Weddle|p=126}} He wrote one episode "The Town" (December 13, 1957) for the [[CBS]] series, ''[[Trackdown (TV series)|Trackdown]]'', starring [[Robert Culp]] as the [[Texas Rangers Division|Texas Ranger]] Hoby Gilman. The script is about a cowardly town afraid to resist the clutches of an [[outlaw]] gang.<ref>Billy Hathorn, "Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), p. 106</ref>

Peckinpah wrote a screenplay from the novel ''The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones'', a draft that evolved into the 1961 [[Marlon Brando]] film ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]''.{{sfn|Simmons|p=28}} His writing led to directing, and he directed a 1958 episode of ''Broken Arrow'' (generally credited as his first official directing job) and several 1960 episodes of ''[[Klondike (TV series)|Klondike]]'', (co-starring [[James Coburn]], [[L. Q. Jones]], [[Ralph Taeger]], [[Joi Lansing]], and [[Mari Blanchard]]). He also directed the CBS [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Mr. Adams and Eve]]'', starring [[Howard Duff]] and [[Ida Lupino]].{{sfn|Simmons|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Klondike|IMDB}}

In 1958, Peckinpah wrote a script for ''Gunsmoke'' that was rejected due to content. He reworked the screenplay, titled ''The Sharpshooter'', and sold it to ''Zane Grey Theater''. The episode received popular response and became the television series ''[[The Rifleman]]'', starring [[Chuck Connors]]. Peckinpah directed four episodes of the series (with guest stars [[R. G. Armstrong]] and [[Warren Oates]]), but left after the first year. ''The Rifleman'' ran for five seasons and achieved enduring popularity in syndication.{{sfn|Simmons|pp=29–30}}{{sfn|Rifleman|IMDB}}

===''The Westerner''===
{{main|The Westerner (TV series)}}
[[File:Brian Keith The Westerner 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Brian Keith in ''The Westerner'' (1960)]]
During this time, he also created the television series ''[[The Westerner (TV series)|The Westerner]]'', starring [[Brian Keith]] and in three episodes also featuring [[John Dehner]]. Peckinpah wrote and directed a pilot called ''Trouble at Tres Cruzes'', which was aired in March 1959 before the actual series was made in 1960. Peckinpah acted as producer of the series, having a hand in the writing of each episode and directing five of them. Critically praised, the show ran for only 13 episodes before cancellation mainly due to its gritty content detailing the drifting, laconic cowboy Dave Blassingame (Brian Keith). Especially the episodes ''Jeff'' and ''Hand on the Gun'' are in their depiction of violence and with their imaginative directing remarkable forerunners of his later feature films. Despite its short run, ''The Westerner'' and Peckinpah were nominated by the [[Producers Guild of America]] for Best Filmed Series. An episode of the series eventually served as the basis for Tom Gries' 1968 film ''[[Will Penny]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]]. ''The Westerner'', which has since achieved [[cult status]], further established Peckinpah as a talent to be reckoned with.{{sfn|Simmons|pp=31–34}}{{sfn|Westerner|IMDB}}{{sfn|Westerner Trivia|IMDB}}{{sfn|Weddle|p=168–184}}

In 1962 Peckinpah direct two-hour-long episodes for ''The Dick Powell Theater''. In the second of these, ''The Losers'', an updated [[remake]] of ''The Westerner'' set in the present day with [[Lee Marvin]] as Dave Blassingame and [[Keenan Wynn]] as Dehner's character Bergundy Smith, he mixed slow motion, fast motion and stills together to capture violence, a technique famously put to more sophisticated use in 1969s ''The Wild Bunch''.{{sfn|Simmons|p=55-6}}

==Early film career==

===''The Deadly Companions''===
{{main|The Deadly Companions}}
After cancellation of ''The Westerner'', [[Brian Keith]] was cast as the male lead in the 1961 Western film ''[[The Deadly Companions]]''. He suggested Peckinpah as director and the project's producer [[Charles B. Fitzsimons]] accepted the idea. By most accounts, the low-budget film shot on location in [[Arizona]] was a learning process for Peckinpah, who feuded with Fitzsimons (brother of the film's star [[Maureen O'Hara]]) over the screenplay and staging of the scenes. Reportedly, Fitzsimons refused to allow Peckinpah to give direction to O'Hara. Unable to rewrite the screenplay or edit the picture, Peckinpah vowed to never again direct a film unless he had script control. ''The Deadly Companions'' passed largely without notice and is the least known of Peckinpah's films.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=197–198}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=36–39}}

===''Ride the High Country''===
{{main|Ride the High Country}}
His second film, ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' (1962), was based on the screenplay ''Guns in the Afternoon'' written by N.B. Stone, Jr. Producer Richard Lyons admired Peckinpah's work on ''The Westerner'' and offered him the directing job. Peckinpah did an extensive rewrite of the screenplay, including personal references from his own childhood growing up on Denver Church's ranch, and even naming one of the mining towns "Coarsegold." He based the character of Steve Judd, a once-famous lawman fallen on hard times, on his own father David Peckinpah. In the screenplay, Judd and old friend Gil Westrum are hired to transport gold from a mining community through dangerous territory. Westrum hopes to talk Judd into taking the gold for themselves. Along the way, following the example of Judd, Westrum slowly realizes his own self-respect is far more important than profit. During the final shootout, when Judd and Westrum stand up to a trio of men, Judd is fatally wounded and his death serves as Westrum's salvation – a [[Divine grace|Catholic]] tragedy weaved from the Western genre. It became a major theme in many Peckinpah films to come. Starring aging Western stars [[Joel McCrea]] and [[Randolph Scott]] in their final major screen roles, the film initially went unnoticed in the United States but was an enormous success in Europe. Beating [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]'' for first prize at the Belgium Film Festival, the film was hailed by foreign critics as a brilliant reworking of the Western genre. New York critics also discovered Peckinpah's unusual Western, with ''[[Newsweek]]'' naming ''Ride the High Country'' the best film of the year and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' placing it on its best-ten list. By some critics, the film is admired as one of Peckinpah's greatest works.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=198–219}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=41–54}}

===''Major Dundee''===
{{main|Major Dundee}}
Peckinpah's next film, ''[[Major Dundee]]'' (1965), was the first of Peckinpah's many unfortunate experiences with the major studios that financed his productions. Based on a screenplay by [[Harry Julian Fink]], the film was to star [[Charlton Heston]]. Peckinpah was hired as director after Heston viewed producer [[Jerry Bresler (film producer)|Jerry Bresler]]'s private screening of ''Ride the High Country''. Heston liked the film and called Peckinpah, saying, "I'd like to work with you."{{sfn|Fine|p=84}} The sprawling screenplay told the story of [[Union cavalry]] officer Major Dundee who commands a [[New Mexico]] outpost of [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] prisoners. When an [[Apache]] war chief wipes out a company and kidnaps several children, Dundee throws together a makeshift army, including unwilling Confederate veterans, black Federal soldiers, and traditional Western types, and takes off after the Indians. Dundee becomes obsessed with his quest and heads deep into the wilderness of Mexico with his exhausted men in tow. Peckinpah's first big-budget film had a large cast, including Heston, [[Richard Harris]], [[James Coburn]], [[Senta Berger]], [[Jim Hutton]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Warren Oates]], [[R. G. Armstrong]] and [[L. Q. Jones]]. Filming began without a completed screenplay, and Peckinpah chose several remote locations in [[Mexico]], causing the film to go heavily over [[film budgeting|budget]]. Intimidated by the size and scope of the project, Peckinpah reportedly drank heavily each night after shooting. He also fired at least 15 [[Film crew|crew members]]. At one point, Peckinpah's mean streak and abusiveness towards the actors so enraged Heston that the normally even-tempered star threatened to run the director through with his cavalry [[saber]] if he did not show more courtesy to the cast. Shooting ended 15 days over schedule and $1.5 million more than budgeted with Peckinpah and producer Bresler no longer on speaking terms. The movie, detailing themes and sequences Peckinpah mastered later in his career, was taken away from him and substantially reedited. An incomplete mess which today exists in a variety of versions, ''Major Dundee'' performed poorly at the box office and was trashed by critics (though its standing has improved over the years). Peckinpah held for the rest of his life that his original version of ''Major Dundee'' was among his best films, but his reputation was severely damaged.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=229–244}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=55–72}}{{sfn|Major Dundee Trivia|IMDB}}

Peckinpah was next signed to direct ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'', a gambling drama about a young prodigy who takes on an old master during a big [[New Orleans]] [[poker]] match. Before filming started, producer [[Martin Ransohoff]] began to receive phone calls about the ''Major Dundee'' ordeal and was told Peckinpah was impossible to work with. In addition, Peckinpah decided to shoot in black and white and was hoping to transform the screenplay into a social realist saga about a kid surviving the tough streets of the [[Great Depression]]. After four days of filming, which reportedly included some nude scenes, Ransohoff disliked the [[Dailies|rushes]] and immediately fired him.{{sfn|Carroll}} Eventually directed by [[Norman Jewison]] and starring [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]], the film went on to become a 1965 hit.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=257–263}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=73–81}}

===''Noon Wine''===
He caught a lucky break in 1966 when producer [[Daniel Melnick]] needed a writer and director to adapt [[Katherine Anne Porter]]'s short novel ''[[Noon Wine]]'' for television. Melnick was a big fan of ''The Westerner'' and ''Ride the High Country'', and had heard Peckinpah had been unfairly fired from ''The Cincinnati Kid''. Against the objections of many within the industry, Melnick hired Peckinpah and gave him free rein. Peckinpah completed the script, which Miss Porter enthusiastically endorsed, and the project became [[Noon Wine#1966 Television|an hour-long presentation]] for ''[[ABC Stage 67]]''. Taking place in turn of the century West Texas, ''Noon Wine'' was a dark tragedy about a farmer's act of futile murder which leads to suicide. Starring [[Jason Robards]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]], the film was a critical hit, with Peckinpah nominated by the [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] for Best Television Adaptation and the [[Directors Guild of America]] for Best Television Direction. Robards kept a personal copy of the film in his private collection for years as he considered the project to be one of his most satisfying professional experiences. A rare film which had no home video release until 2014, ''Noon Wine'' is today considered one of Peckinpah's most intimate works, revealing his dramatic potential and artistic depth.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=280–295}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=76–80}}{{sfn|Noon Wine|IMDB}}

==International fame==

===''The Wild Bunch''===
{{main|The Wild Bunch}}
The surprising success of ''Noon Wine'' laid the groundwork for one of the most explosive comebacks in film history. In 1967, [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] producers Kenneth Hyman and Phil Feldman were interested in having Peckinpah rewrite and direct an adventure film, ''The Diamond Story''. An alternative screenplay written by Roy Sickner and [[Walon Green]] was the western ''The Wild Bunch''. At the time, [[William Goldman]]'s screenplay ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' had recently been purchased by [[20th Century Fox]].

It was quickly decided that ''The Wild Bunch'', which had several similarities to Goldman's work, would be produced in order to beat ''Butch Cassidy'' to the theaters.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=307–309}} By the fall of 1967, Peckinpah was rewriting the screenplay into what became ''[[The Wild Bunch]]''. Filmed on location in Mexico, Peckinpah's epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in [[Arthur Penn]]'s ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'', America's growing frustration with the [[Vietnam War]], and what he perceived to be the utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but the crude men attempting to survive the era. Starring [[William Holden]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Robert Ryan]], [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]], [[Warren Oates]], [[Strother Martin]], [[Jaime Sánchez (actor)|Jaime Sánchez]] and [[Edmond O'Brien]], the film detailed a gang of veteran outlaws on the Texas/Mexico border in 1913 trying to exist within a rapidly approaching modern world. ''The Wild Bunch'' is framed by two ferocious and infamous gunfights, beginning with a failed robbery of the railway company office and concluding with the outlaws battling the Mexican army in suicidal vengeance due to the death of one of their members.{{sfn|Weddle||pp=310–331}} Irreverent and unprecedented in its explicit detail, the 1969 film was an instant success. Multiple scenes attempted in ''Major Dundee'', including [[slow motion]] action sequences, characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, were perfected in ''The Wild Bunch''. Many critics denounced its violence as sadistic and exploitative. Other critics and filmmakers hailed the originality of its unique rapid [[film editing|editing]] style, created for the first time in this film and ultimately becoming a Peckinpah trademark, and praised the reworking of traditional Western themes. It was the beginning of Peckinpah's international fame, and he and his work remained controversial for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=376–377}} The film was ranked [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|No. 80]] on the [[American Film Institute]]'s top 100 list of the greatest American films ever made and [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills|No. 69]] as the most thrilling, but the controversy has not diminished.{{sfn|AFI|100}} When ''The Wild Bunch'' was re-released for its 25th anniversary, it received an [[MPAA film rating system|NC-17]] rating from the [[MPAA]], proving the film's continued impact after so many years.{{sfn|Wild Bunch Trivia|IMDB}} Peckinpah received his only [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Best Original Screenplay]] for this film.

===''The Ballad of Cable Hogue''===
{{main|The Ballad of Cable Hogue}}
Defying audience expectations, as he often did, Peckinpah immediately followed ''The Wild Bunch'' with the elegiac, funny and mostly non-violent 1970 Western ''[[The Ballad of Cable Hogue]]''. Utilizing many of the same cast (L. Q. Jones, [[Strother Martin]]) and crew members of ''The Wild Bunch'', the film covered three years in the life of small-time entrepreneur Cable Hogue ([[Jason Robards]]) who decides to make a fortune after discovering water in the desert. He opens his business along a [[stagecoach]] line, only to see his dreams end with the appearance of the first [[automobile]] on the horizon. Shot on location in the [[Valley of Fire State Park|Valley of Fire]] in [[Nevada]], the film was plagued by poor weather, Peckinpah's renewed drinking and his brusque firing of 36 crew members. The chaotic filming wrapped 19 days over schedule and $3 million over budget, effectively terminating his tenure with [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]]. In retrospect, it was a damaging career move as ''[[Deliverance]]'' and ''[[Jeremiah Johnson (film)|Jeremiah Johnson]]'', critical and enduring box office hits, were in development at the time and Peckinpah was considered the first choice to direct both films.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=391–392}} Largely ignored upon its initial release, ''The Ballad of Cable Hogue'' has been rediscovered in recent years and is often held up by critics as exemplary of the breadth of Peckinpah's talents. They claim that the film proves Peckinpah's ability to make unconventional and original work without resorting to explicit violence. Over the years, Peckinpah cited the film as one of his favorites.{{sfn|Weddle|p=383–389}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=108–120}}{{sfn|Cable Hogue Trivia|IMDB}}

===''Straw Dogs''===
{{main|Straw Dogs (1971 film)}}
His alienation of Warner Brothers once again left him with a limited number of directing jobs. Peckinpah was forced to do a 180-degree turn and traveled to England to direct ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971), one of his darkest and most psychologically disturbing films. Produced by Daniel Melnick, who had previously worked with Peckinpah on ''Noon Wine'', the screenplay was based on the novel ''The Siege of Trencher's Farm'' by [[Gordon Williams]]. It starred [[Dustin Hoffman]] as David Sumner, a timid American mathematician (his wife at one point attempts to erase Einstein's field equations from his blackboard) who leaves the chaos of college [[opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-war protests]] to live with his young wife Amy ([[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]]) in her native village in [[Cornwall]], England. Resentment of David's presence by the locals slowly builds to a shocking climax when the mild-mannered academic is forced to defend his home. Peckinpah entirely rewrote the existing screenplay, inspired by the books ''African Genesis'' and ''The Territorial Imperative'' by [[Robert Ardrey]], which argued that man was essentially a [[carnivore]] who instinctively battled over control of territory.{{sfn|Weddle|p=396}} The character of David Sumner, taunted and humiliated by the town locals, is eventually cornered within his home where he loses control and kills several of the men during the violent conclusion. ''Straw Dogs'' deeply divided critics, some of whom praised its artistry and its confrontation of human savagery, while others attacked it as a [[misogynistic]] and [[fascistic]] celebration of violence.{{sfn|Weddle|p=427}} Much of the criticism centered on Amy's complicated and lengthy rape scene, which Peckinpah reportedly attempted to base on his own personal fears rooted in past failed marriages. To this day, the scene is attacked by critics as an ugly [[chauvinism|male-chauvinist]] fantasy, claiming it serves as an example of Peckinpah's (and Hollywood's) debasing of women.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=399–400}} The film was for many years banned on video in the UK, although some critics have come to hail it as one of Peckinpah's greatest films.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=393–403}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=121–138}}{{sfn|Straw Dogs Trivia|IMDB}}

===''Junior Bonner''===
{{main|Junior Bonner}}
Despite his growing alcoholism and controversial reputation, Peckinpah was extremely prolific during this period of his life. In May 1971, weeks after completing ''Straw Dogs'', he returned to the United States to begin work on ''[[Junior Bonner]]''. The lyrical screenplay by Jeb Rosenbrook, depicting the changing times of society and binding family ties, appealed to Peckinpah's tastes. He accepted the project, at the time concerned with being typed as a director of violent action. The film was his final attempt to make a low-key, dramatic work in the vein of ''Noon Wine'' and ''The Ballad of Cable Hogue''. Filmed on location in [[Prescott, Arizona]], the story covered a week in the life of aging [[rodeo]] rider Junior "JR" Bonner ([[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]]) who returns to his hometown to compete in an annual rodeo competition. In addition to McQueen, the cast included [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], [[Ida Lupino]], [[Joe Don Baker]] and [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]]. ''Junior Bonner'' was marked by sharp character development, colorful location detail and unusually tender scenes between Preston and Lupino as Bonner's estranged parents. Promoted as a Steve McQueen action vehicle, reviews were mixed and the film performed poorly at the box office. Peckinpah remarked, "I made a film where nobody got shot and nobody went to see it." The film's reputation has grown over the years as many critics consider ''Junior Bonner'' to be one of Peckinpah's most sympathetic works, while also noting McQueen's earnest performance.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=428–434}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=139–153}}

===''The Getaway''===
{{main|The Getaway (1972 film)}}
Eager to work with Peckinpah again, Steve McQueen presented him [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]]'s screenplay to ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]''. Based on the [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] novel, the gritty crime thriller detailed lovers on the run following a dangerous robbery. Both Peckinpah and McQueen needed a hit, and they immediately began working on the film in February 1972.{{sfn|Weddle|p=434}} Peckinpah had no pretensions about making ''The Getaway'', as his only goal was to create a highly polished thriller to boost his market value.{{sfn|Weddle|p=436}} McQueen played Doc McCoy, an imprisoned mastermind robber whose wife Carol ([[Ali MacGraw]]) conspires for his release on the condition they rob a bank in Texas. A doublecross follows the crime, and the McCoys are forced to flee for Mexico with both the police and criminals in hot pursuit. Replete with explosions, car chases and intense shootouts, the film became Peckinpah's biggest financial success to date earning more than $25 million at the box office.{{sfn|Getaway Box Office|IMDB}} Though strictly a commercial product, Peckinpah's creative touches abound throughout, most notably during the intricately edited opening sequence when McQueen's character is suffering from the pressures of prison life.{{sfn|Weddle|p=439}} The film remains popular and was [[The Getaway (1994 film)|remade in 1994]].{{sfn|Getaway|IMDB}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=154–168}}{{sfn|Weddle|p=442}} starring Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

==Later career==
The year 1973 marked the beginning of the most difficult period of Peckinpah's life and career. While still filming ''The Getaway'' in [[El Paso, Texas]], Peckinpah sneaked across the border into [[Ciudad Juárez|Juarez]] in April 1972 and married Joie Gould. He had met Gould in England while filming ''Straw Dogs'', and she had since been his companion and a part-time crew member. Peckinpah's intake of alcohol had increased dramatically while making ''The Getaway'', and he became fond of saying, "I can't direct when I'm sober." He began to have violent mood swings and explosions of rage, at one point assaulting Gould. After four months, she returned to England and filed for divorce. Devastated by the breakup, Peckinpah fell into a self-destructive pattern of almost continuous alcohol consumption, and his health was unstable for the remainder of his life.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=444–450}}

===''Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid''===
{{main|Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid}}
It was in this state of mind that Peckinpah agreed to make ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973) for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Based on the screenplay by [[Rudolph Wurlitzer]] (who had previously penned ''[[Two-Lane Blacktop]]'', a film admired by Peckinpah), the director was convinced that he was about to make his definitive statement on the Western genre.{{sfn|Weddle|p=453}} The script offered Peckinpah the opportunity to explore themes that appealed to him: two former partners forced by changing times onto opposite sides of the law, manipulated by corrupt economic interests. Peckinpah rewrote the screenplay, establishing Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid as friends, and attempted to weave an epic tragedy from the historical legend. Filmed on location in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Durango]], the film starred [[James Coburn]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]] in the title roles, with a huge supporting cast including [[Bob Dylan]] (who composed the film's music), [[Jason Robards]], [[R. G. Armstrong]], [[Richard Jaeckel]], [[Jack Elam]], [[Chill Wills]], [[Katy Jurado]], [[Matt Clark (actor)|Matt Clark]], [[L. Q. Jones]], [[Rutanya Alda]], [[Slim Pickens]] and [[Harry Dean Stanton]].{{sfn|Pat Garrett|IMDB}} From the beginning, Peckinpah began to have clashes with MGM and its president [[James Aubrey]], known for his stifling of creative interests and eventual dismantling of the historic movie company.{{sfn|Weddle|p=463}} Numerous production difficulties, including an outbreak of influenza and malfunctioning cameras, combined with Peckinpah's growing problems with alcohol, resulted in one of the most troubled productions of his career. The film finished 21 days behind schedule and $1.6 million over budget. Enraged, Aubrey severely cut Peckinpah's film from 124 to 106 minutes, resulting in ''Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid'' being released in a truncated version largely disowned by cast and crew members. Critics complained that the film was incoherent, and the experience soured Peckinpah forever on Hollywood. In 1988, however, Peckinpah's director's cut was released on video and led to a reevaluation, with many critics hailing it as a mistreated classic and one of the era's best films. Filmmakers, including [[Martin Scorsese]], have praised the film as one of the greatest modern Westerns.{{sfn|Weddle|p=483}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=169–188}}

===''Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia''===
{{main|Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia}}
In the eyes of his admirers, ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'' (1974) was the last true "Peckinpah film." The director himself claimed that it was the only one of his films to be released exactly as he intended it. A project in development for many years and based on an idea by [[Frank Kowalski]], Peckinpah wrote the screenplay with the assistance of Kowalski, Walter Kelley and Gordon Dawson. An alcohol-soaked fever dream involving revenge, greed and murder in the Mexican countryside, the film featured [[Warren Oates]] as a thinly disguised self-portrait of Peckinpah, and co-starred a leather bag containing the severed head of a gigolo being sought by a Mexican patrone for one million dollars. The macabre drama was part [[black comedy]], [[action film]] and [[tragedy]], with a warped edge rarely seen in Peckinpah's works. Most critics were repulsed, and it was listed in the book [[The Fifty Worst Films of All Time|The 50 Worst Films of All Time]] by Harry Medved and Randy Dreyfuss.{{sfn|Medved|pp=51–55}} One of the few critics to praise the film was [[Roger Ebert]], and in fact, the film's reputation has grown in recent years, with many noting its uncompromising vision as well as its anticipation of the violent black comedy which became famous in the works of such directors as [[David Lynch]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]].{{sfn|Ebert review}} While a failure at the box office, the film today has a devoted cult following. In 1991, [[UCLA]]'s film school organized a festival of great but forgotten American films, and included ''Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia'' in the program.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=492–498}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=189–208}} It is reportedly [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s favorite film. It also led a film critic to paraphrase the film's title in an attack on the director, saying, "Bring me the head of Sam Peckinpah".

===''The Killer Elite''===
{{main|The Killer Elite}}
His career now suffering from consecutive box office failures, Peckinpah once again was in need of a hit on the level of ''The Getaway''. For his next film, he chose ''[[The Killer Elite]]'' (1975), an action-filled espionage thriller starring [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] and [[Robert Duvall]] as rival American agents. Filmed on location in San Francisco, Peckinpah allegedly discovered [[cocaine]] for the first time thanks to Caan and his entourage.{{sfn|Weddle|p=499}} This led to increased [[paranoia]] and his once legendary dedication to detail deteriorated. Producers also refused to allow Peckinpah to rewrite the screenplay (for the first time since his debut film ''[[The Deadly Companions]]''). Frustrated, the director spent large amounts of time in his on-location trailer, allowing assistants to direct many scenes. At one point he [[Drug overdose|overdosed]] on cocaine, landing himself in a hospital and receiving a second [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]]. The film was completed and was reasonably successful at box office business, although critics panned it. Today, the film is considered one of Peckinpah's weakest films, and an example of his decline as a major director.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=498–500}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=209–224}}

===''Cross of Iron''===
{{main|Cross of Iron}}
Still renowned in 1975, Peckinpah was offered the opportunity to direct the eventual blockbusters ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' (1976) and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978).
{{sfn|Weddle|p=504}} He turned down both offers and chose instead the bleak and vivid [[World War II]] drama ''[[Cross of Iron]]'' (1977). The screenplay was based on a novel about a platoon of [[Wehrmacht|German soldiers]] in 1943 on the verge of utter collapse on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Taman Peninsula]]. The German production was filmed in [[Yugoslavia]]. Working with James Hamilton and Walter Kelley, Peckinpah rewrote the screenplay and screened numerous [[Nazi propaganda|Nazi documentaries]] in preparation. Almost immediately, Peckinpah realized he was working on a low-budget production, as he had to spend $90,000 of his own money to hire experienced crew members. While not suffering from the cocaine abuse which marked ''The Killer Elite'', Peckinpah continued to drink heavily causing his direction to become confused and erratic. The production abruptly ran out of funds, and Peckinpah was forced to completely improvise the concluding sequence, filming the scene in one day. Despite these obstacles, the film's war footage was stunning and [[James Coburn]], in the lead role of Rolf Steiner, gave one of the finest performances of his career. Co-starring [[James Mason]], [[Maximilian Schell]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and [[Senta Berger]], ''Cross of Iron'' was noted for its opening montage utilizing documentary footage as well as the visceral impact of the unusually intense battle sequences. The film was a huge box office success in Europe, inspiring the sequel ''[[Breakthrough (1979 film)|Breakthrough]]'' starring [[Richard Burton]].{{sfn|Breakthrough|IMDB}} ''Cross of Iron'' was reportedly a favorite of [[Orson Welles]], who said that after ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' it was the finest anti-war film he had ever seen.{{sfn|Simmons|p=236}} The film performed poorly in the U.S., eclipsed ultimately by ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', though today it is highly regarded and considered the last gasp of Peckinpah's once-great talent.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=504–513}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=225–237}}

===''Convoy''===
{{main|Convoy (1978 film)}}
Hoping to create the blockbuster, Peckinpah decided to take on ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' (1978). His associates were perplexed, as they felt his choice to direct such substandard material was a result of his renewed cocaine use and continued alcoholism. Based on the hit [[Convoy (song)|song]] by [[C. W. McCall]], the film was an attempt to capitalize on the huge success of ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' (1977). Addictions or not, Peckinpah still felt compelled to turn the genre exercise into something more significant. Unhappy with the screenplay written by B.W.L. Norton, Peckinpah tried to encourage the actors to re-write, improvise and ad-lib their dialogue. In another departure from the script, Peckinpah attempted to add a new dimension by casting a pair of black actors as members of the convoy, [[Madge Sinclair]] as Widow Woman and [[Franklyn Ajaye]] as Spider Mike. Filmed in [[New Mexico]] and starring [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Ali MacGraw]] and [[Ernest Borgnine]], ''Convoy'' turned out to be yet another troubled Peckinpah production, with the director's health a continuing problem. Friend and actor [[James Coburn]] was brought in to serve as [[second unit director]], and he filmed many of the scenes while Peckinpah remained in his on-location trailer. The film wrapped in September 1977, 11 days behind schedule and $5 million over budget. Surprisingly, ''Convoy'' was the highest-grossing picture of Peckinpah's career, notching $46.5 million at the box office, but was panned by critics, leaving his reputation seriously damaged. For the first time in almost a decade, Peckinpah finished a picture and found himself unemployed.{{sfn|Weddle|pp=514–518}}{{sfn|Simmons|pp=232–236}}

====2nd unit work on ''Jinxed!''====
For the next three years, Peckinpah remained a professional outcast. But during the summer of 1981, his original mentor [[Don Siegel]] gave him a chance to return to filmmaking. While shooting ''[[Jinxed!]]'', a comedy drama starring [[Bette Midler]] and [[Rip Torn]], Siegel asked Peckinpah if he would be interested in directing 12 days of second unit work. Peckinpah immediately accepted, and his earnest collaboration, while uncredited, was noted within the industry. For the final time, Peckinpah found himself back in the directing business.{{sfn|Jinxed!|IMDB}}{{sfn|Weddle|pp=534–535}}{{sfn|Simmons|p=239}}

===''The Osterman Weekend''===
{{main|The Osterman Weekend (film)}}
By 1982, however, Peckinpah's health was in poor shape. Producers Peter S. Davis and [[William N. Panzer]] were undaunted, as they felt that having Peckinpah's name attached to ''[[The Osterman Weekend (film)|The Osterman Weekend]]'' (1983) would lend the [[suspense thriller]] an air of respectability. Peckinpah accepted the job but reportedly hated the convoluted screenplay based upon [[Robert Ludlum]]'s novel (which he also disliked). Multiple actors in Hollywood auditioned for the film, intrigued by the opportunity. Many of those who signed on, including [[John Hurt]], [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Dennis Hopper]], did so for less than their usual salaries for a chance to work with the legendary director. By the time shooting wrapped in January 1983 in Los Angeles, Peckinpah and the producers were hardly speaking. Nevertheless, Peckinpah brought in the film on time and on budget, delivering his [[director's cut]] to the producers. Davis and Panzer were unhappy with Peckinpah's version, which included a grossly distorted opening sequence of two characters making love. The producers changed the opening and also deleted other scenes they deemed unnecessary. ''The Osterman Weekend'' had some effective action sequences and some strong supporting performances, but Peckinpah's final film was critically panned. It grossed $6 million in the United States and did well in Europe and on the new home-video market.{{sfn|Simmons|p=239}}{{sfn|Weddle|pp=535–537}}

====Julian Lennon music videos====
Peckinpah's last work as a filmmaker was undertaken just two months before his death. He was hired by producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] to shoot two music videos featuring [[Julian Lennon]] – "[[Valotte (song)|Valotte]]" and "[[Too Late For Goodbyes]]". The critically acclaimed videos led to Lennon's nomination for Best New Video Artist at the 1985 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].{{sfn|Weddle|pp=541–543}}{{sfn|MTV}}

==Themes==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}
Peckinpah's films generally deal with the conflict between values and ideals and the corruption and violence of human society. His characters are often loners or losers who harbor the desire to be honorable and idealistic but are forced to compromise themselves in order to survive in a world of nihilism and brutality.

The conflicts of masculinity are also a major theme of his work, leading some critics{{Who|date=April 2010}} to compare him to [[Ernest Hemingway]]. Peckinpah's world is a man's world, and feminists{{Who|date=April 2010}} have castigated his films as misogynistic and sexist, especially concerning the shooting of a woman during the final moments of ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'', the rape sequence in ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' and Doc McCoy's physical assault of his wife in ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]''.

Many critics{{Who|date=April 2010}} see his worldview as a misanthropic, [[Hobbes]]ian view of nature as essentially evil and savage. Peckinpah himself stated the opposite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} He saw violence as the product of human society, and not of nature. It is the result of men's competition with each other over power and domination, and their inability to negotiate this competition without resorting to brutality. Peckinpah also used violence as a means to achieve [[catharsis]], believing his audience would be purged of violence by witnessing it explicitly on screen (one of the major inspirations for his violent sequences in ''The Wild Bunch''). Peckinpah later admitted that this idea was mistaken, and that audiences had come to enjoy the violence in his films rather than be horrified by it, something that deeply troubled him later in his career.

Peckinpah, who was born to a ranching family that included judges and lawyers, was also deeply concerned by the conflict between "old-fashioned" values and the corruption and materialism of the modern world. Many of his characters are attempting to live up to their expectations of themselves even as the world they live in demands that they compromise their values.

This theme is most evident in Peckinpah's Westerns. Unlike most Western directors, Peckinpah tended to concentrate on the early 20th century rather than the 19th, and his films portray characters who still believe in the values of the Old West being swept away by the new, industrial America.

This persistent theme has led many critics to view Peckinpah's films as essentially tragic. That is, his characters are portrayed as being prisoners of their fates and their own failings who nonetheless seek redemption and meaning in an absurd and violent world. The theme of longing for redemption, justification, and honor in a dishonorable existence permeates almost all of Peckinpah's work.

==Documentaries==

*Sam Peckinpah has been the subject of three documentaries including the [[BBC]] production ''[[Sam Peckinpah: Man of Iron]]'' (1992), directed by Paul Joyce, ''[[Sam Peckinpah's West: Legacy of a Hollywood Renegade]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Wild Bunch: An Album in Montage]]'' (1996) directed by Paul Seydor.

*Over a 4-year period German film maker Mike Siegel produced and directed ''Passion & Poetry – The Ballad of Sam Peckinpah'' a two-hour long film about Sam Peckinpah which includes rare Peckinpah – interviews and statements. In 2009 the 2 – disc special edition with a running time of 270 minutes was released on DVD.

==Parodies==
*[[John Belushi]] portrayed Peckinpah as a deranged lunatic who directs his first romantic comedy by beating up his leading lady in the first season, fifth episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.{{sfn|SNL Episodes|IMDB}}
*Peckinpah's use of violence was parodied by [[Monty Python]] in [[Sam Peckinpah's "Salad Days"]], one of the more controversial episodes of [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]], in which a lovely day out for an upper-class English family turns into a [[Blood squirt|blood-soaked orgy of severed limbs and gushing wounds]].{{sfn|Weddle|p=428}} Peckinpah reportedly loved this sketch and enjoyed showing it to friends and family.
*Peckinpah's penchant for filming action scenes in slow motion was satirized by [[Benny Hill]] in a Western skit called "The Deputy" that first aired on his March 29, 1973 special. In one scene, Hill's titular character shoots one of the villains ([[Bob Todd]]), who then proceeds to pirouette in extremely slow motion before collapsing.
*In the film ''[[Fletch (film)|Fletch]]'' (1985), the main character, imitating a doctor in order to examine medical records, calls out, "And bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia!"{{sfn|Fletch Quotes|IMDB}}
*In the 1973 [[Sergio Leone]]/Tonino Valerii [[spaghetti western]] ''[[My Name is Nobody]]'', the characters Jack Beauregard ([[Henry Fonda]]) and "Nobody" ([[Terence Hill]]) meet at a cemetery. Nobody walks past the tombstones reading the names and comes across one labeled "Sam Peckimpah".  He says "Sam Peckimpah. That's a beautiful name in Navajo." Leone named the gang in the film "The Wild Bunch". Nobody has Beauregard face The Wild Bunch in order to be known in history books.
*Various Peckinpah films are parodied in [[Jim Reardon]]'s student film ''[[Bring Me the Head of Charlie Brown]]''.
*In the film ''[[Deadfall (1993 film)|Deadfall]]'' (1993), when the character Eddie ([[Nicolas Cage]]) mortally wounds a would-be assassin, he asks the man "Who sent you?" The killer responds, "Sam fuckin' Peckinpah." This film was later adapted into a song of the same name by [[Snot (band)|Snot]].
*In the [[John Waters]] film ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' (2000), several characters have the name of a legendary film director tattooed on their body. One of the characters has "Sam Peckinpah" tattooed on their arm.{{sfn|Cecil B. DeMented Trivia|IMDB}}
*In the 1986 horror film ''[[Chopping Mall]]'', a store in the mall that survivors use to supply themselves with assault rifles, ammunition and grenades is named Peckinpah's Sporting Goods, a wry reference to the director's film violence.{{sfn|Chopping Mall Connections|IMDB}}
*In the 2006 film ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', one of the characters is mentioned to be an extra in ''Straw Dogs'', and a farm is owned by the Treachers, making it Treacher Farm.
*In the 1993 [[Denis Leary]] song "[[Asshole (song)|Asshole]]", Leary states he is "going to get the Duke ([[John Wayne]]), [[John Cassavetes]], [[Lee Marvin]], Sam Peckinpah and a case of whiskey then drive down to Texas" before being cut off by a bandmate and getting called an asshole.
*In the BBC Radio 4 panel show ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', the ''Film Club'' round usually includes a film name based on ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]''.
*[[Kris Kristofferson]] recorded "Sam's Song (Ask Any Working Girl)", a brief tribute to the director, for his 1995 release "A Moment of Forever".
