==Early life==

He was brought up in a Catholic household.

Egglesfield spent his early childhood in the [[Metro Detroit]] area. At the age of ten, he and his family moved to Morris IL, a small community south of [[Chicago]]. Growing up, he was more studious than rambunctious, preferring to spend Friday nights alone building model airplanes. His dream was to follow his father's footsteps as a physician, but became interested in acting watching his older sister Kerry perform.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Shy in his adolescent years, he credits his prep football coach, Dave Mattio, with helping gain a positive self-esteem. After Egglesfield graduated from [[Marian Catholic High School]] in [[Chicago Heights]], he attended [[Illinois Wesleyan University]] and played for the football team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovetwenty.com/2011/10/interview-with-colin-egglesfield/ |title=Interview with Colin Egglesfield of "Something Borrowed" |date=October 7, 2011 |publisher=Love Twenty |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |first=Tehrene |last=Firman }}</ref> He transferred to the [[University of Iowa]], where he was in the pre-med program. After he received his BS from Iowa he backpacked throughout Europe. 

To earn money for medical school, Egglesfield turned to modeling. He won a contest (he entered at the urging of a friend), and soon after, he left medicine behind for a modeling career. He is signed with [[Beatrice Model agency]] in [[Milan]], Italy, and DNA Model Management in [[New York City]]. He modeled for [[Versace]], [[Calvin Klein]], and [[Armani]], among others before he started acting.<ref name="Official Website">{{cite web|title=Colin Egglesfield - Official Website - Bio|url=http://www.colinegglesfield.com/bio.html|accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref> In the late 90's, he was featured on the covers of [[Vogue Italia |italian Vogue]] (shot by [[Steven Meisel]]) and [[L'Uomo Vogue]] (twice, photographed by [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]] and [[Ellen Von Unwerth]] respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colin-egglesfield.net/nicks-collective/thumbnails.php?album=22 |title= Vogue Italia gallery |date=June 5, 2010 |publisher=colin-egglesfield.net |accessdate=November 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colin-egglesfield.net/nicks-collective/displayimage.php?album=19&pos=0 |title= L'Uomo Vogue gallery|date=June 5, 2010 |publisher=colin-egglesfield.net |accessdate=November 19, 2014}}</ref>
