Text Mining in Python
=====================

IPython Notebooks for the [ASDM class] (http://www.dia.fi.upm.es/ASDM) on [Text Mining] (http://fnl.es/text-mining).

Apart from the full [IPython] (http://ipython.org/) stack, using them requires a working installation of [NLTK] (http://www.nltk.org/), version 2.0.x (i.e., the latest stable release): `pip install nltk` or via installing the Continuum Analytics [Anaconda] (http://continuum.io/downloads) Python Distribution.

To view the notebooks online, you can access them via the IPython Notebook viewer:
